      <title>Notable post-quantum cryptography initiatives paving the way toward Q-Day</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/654887/11-notable-post-quantum-cryptography-initiatives-launched-in-2023.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The point at which quantum computers will be capable of breaking existing cryptographic algorithms — known as “Q-Day” — is approaching. Some security experts believe &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/652972/mastercard-preps-for-the-post-quantum-cybersecurity-threat.html"&gt;Q-Day&lt;/a&gt; will occur within the next decade, potentially leaving all digital information vulnerable under current encryption protocols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While a decade may seem far away, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is fast becoming a high priority for the security community, as it works to understand, build, and implement encryption that can withstand post-quantum threats and attacks of the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PQC migration provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the larger cybersecurity landscape,” Dylan Rudy, lead scientist with Booz Allen’s quantum sciences team, tells CSO. “By integrating new PQC algorithms into a zero-trust architecture, cybersecurity infrastructure can be redesigned into a new crypto agility framework.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At issue is the fact that quantum computers of sufficient power could undermine the mathematical underpinnings of current encryption methods. Experts predict sufficiently powerful quantum computers are years away but &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3487766/cisos-urged-to-prepare-now-for-post-quantum-cryptography.html"&gt;early preparations are needed&lt;/a&gt; not least because the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3552701/the-cisos-guide-to-establishing-quantum-resilience.html"&gt;upgrade process is far from trivial&lt;/a&gt; and may take years in many environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Particularly for those in high-security sectors, where the threat of “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks is keenly felt, waiting for “oven ready” post-quantum encryption products and services to mature is a bad decision. Early adopters can take advantage of hybrid products and services that exist today, as they enable them to start migrating immediately, rather than waiting for updated internet protocols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the latest developments on recently launched initiatives, programs, standards, and resources aimed at helping with the creation, development of, and migration to PQC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NIST ratifies post-quantum encryption standards&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3486075/nist-finally-settles-on-quantum-safe-crypto-standards.html"&gt;approved three post-quantum cryptography algorithms for mainstream development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the announcement, NIST approved ML-KEM, formerly known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, for general encryption and key exchange. ML-DSA (Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, formerly known as &lt;strong&gt;CRYSTALS-Dilithium&lt;/strong&gt;) and SLH-DSA (Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, &lt;strong&gt;SPHINCS+&lt;/strong&gt;) were also given the go-ahead as the basis for digital signatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All three algorithms are capable of withstanding attacks from both classical and (future) quantum computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March 2025, NIST selected &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2025/hqc-announced-as-a-4th-round-selection"&gt;HQC for standardization&lt;/a&gt;. The code-based Key Exchange Mechanism offers a backup or alternative to ML-KEM for encryption and key exchange.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other algorithms are still being evaluated but the approval of the four algorithms as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573083/nist-names-new-post-quantum-cryptography-standards.html"&gt;standards for post-quantum encryption&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3487766/cisos-urged-to-prepare-now-for-post-quantum-cryptography.html"&gt;gives engineers the building blocks&lt;/a&gt; they need for future technology development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an important milestone, but a complex one for us to navigate,” Andersen Cheng, founder and chairman of Post-Quantum, tells CSO. “While these announcements mark a step change in the world’s journey to becoming quantum secure, it does not mean that the entire internet ecosystem is now protected.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which defines how the internet is built, used, and secured, will play a key role in developing the standards that harness post-quantum encryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NIST’s standards should motivate organizations to take the quantum threat seriously,” says Markus Pflitsch, CEO and founder at Terra Quantum. “By standardizing PQC algorithms, NIST provides a roadmap for organizations worldwide to transition to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. Companies will now need to prepare for this migration from classical to post-quantum cryptography and invest in their long-term data security by ensuring they are NIST-compliant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="industry-heavyweights-line-up-behind-pqc"&gt;Industry heavyweights line up behind PQC&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; became the first mainstream browser to &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/a-new-path-for-kyber-on-web.html"&gt;support hybrid post‑quantum key exchanges&lt;/a&gt; by default late last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach combines classical elliptic-curve encryption, for backwards compatibility, with lattice-based PQC derived from ML-KEM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other industry giants — including Amazon and &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-08-13-ibm-developed-algorithms-announced-as-worlds-first-post-quantum-cryptography-standards"&gt;IBM&lt;/a&gt; — have also begun laying foundations for quantum-safe cryptography. For example, IBM has pushed ahead with efforts to integrate post-quantum cryptography into many of its products, such as IBM z16 and IBM Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/08/20/quantum-safe-security-progress-towards-next-generation-cryptography/"&gt;testing PQC in Azure&lt;/a&gt;. AWS has published &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-post-quantum-cryptography-migration-plan/"&gt;PQC integration guides&lt;/a&gt; for developers, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/pqc/"&gt;Cloudflare has begun supporting PQC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="quantum-leap"&gt;Quantum leap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent technology advances are boosting the capabilities of quantum computing and therefore bringing forward the need to roll out quantum-resistant cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/"&gt;Google unveiled Willow&lt;/a&gt;, a new quantum chip that marks a significant step forward in scalable quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unlike previous architectures, Willow demonstrates that increasing the number of qubits can effectively reduce error rates — a major hurdle in building large-scale quantum systems,” says Florent Michel, head of cryptography at Optalysys, a UK-based developer of optical computing hardware. “While further research is needed to validate its scalability, Willow offers a promising new direction, reinforcing the need for quantum-resilient cryptographic solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last February &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/"&gt;Microsoft introduced Majorana 1&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s first quantum processor based on topological qubits. Long theorized as a potential solution to quantum error correction, topological qubits had previously remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft claims to have achieved practical realisation of this technology, a milestone that, despite ongoing debate in the research community, could accelerate the timeline for viable quantum computers,” Michel says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Linux Foundation’s grand alliance to take on PQC&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Linux Foundation launched the &lt;a href="https://pqca.org/"&gt;Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance (PQCA)&lt;/a&gt; in February 2024, bringing together industry giants and researchers to tackle the cryptographic security challenges posed by future quantum computers. The effort is geared toward developing software packages that support PQC standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Founding members of the alliance include AWS, Cisco, Google, IBM, NVIDIA, QuSecure, SandboxAQ, and the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The PQCA will engage in various technical projects to support its objectives, including the development of software for evaluating, prototyping, and deploying new post-quantum algorithms,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-the-post-quantum-cryptography-alliance-pqca"&gt;statement by The Linux Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “By providing these software implementations, the foundation seeks to facilitate the practical adoption of post-quantum cryptography across different industries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, the PQCA &lt;a href="https://pqca.org/news/2025/post-quantum-cryptography-alliance-brings-accelerated-computing-to-post-quantum-cryptography-with-nvidia-cupqc/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that its open source project, Open Quantum Safe (OQS), integrates the &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cupqc"&gt;NVIDIA cuPQC library&lt;/a&gt;, offering GPU-accelerated implementations of cryptographic primitives that are safe against attacks from future quantum computing technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tech community launches PQC Coalition to drive understanding, adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September 2023, a community of technologists, researchers, and expert practitioners launched the &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230926448615/en/Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Coalition-Launches"&gt;PQC Coalition&lt;/a&gt; to drive progress toward broader understanding and public adoption of PQC algorithms. Founding coalition members include IBM Quantum, Microsoft, MITRE, PQShield, SandboxAQ, and the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pqcc.org/"&gt;PQC Coalition&lt;/a&gt; will apply its collective technical expertise and influence to facilitate global adoption of PQC in commercial and open-source technologies. Coalition members will contribute their expertise to motivate and advance interoperable standards and technical approaches and step forward in providing critical outreach and education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coalition will focus on four workstreams:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advancing standards relevant to PQC migration&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Creating technical materials to support education and workforce development&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Producing and verifying open-source, production-quality code, and implementing side-channel resistant code for industry verticals&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ensuring cryptographic agility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;CISA, NSA, NIST issue PQC migration resource&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and NIST &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/Quantum%20Readiness_Final_CLEAR_508c%20(3).pdf"&gt;published a factsheet&lt;/a&gt; on the impacts of quantum capabilities. It urged all organizations, especially those that support critical infrastructure, to develop a quantum-readiness roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Quantum-Readiness: Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography” outlined how organizations can prepare a cryptographic inventory, engage with technology vendors, and assess their supply chain reliance on quantum-vulnerable cryptography in systems and assets. The factsheet also provides recommendations for technology vendors whose products support the use of quantum-vulnerable cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“PQC is about proactively developing and building capabilities to secure critical information and systems from being compromised through the use of quantum computers,” says Rob Joyce, director of NSA cybersecurity. “The transition to a secured quantum computing era is a long-term intensive community effort that will require extensive collaboration between government and industry. The key is to be on this journey today and not wait until the last minute.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;X9 announces initiative to create PQC assessment guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, the Accredited Standards Committee X9 &lt;a href="https://x9.org/x9-launches-effort-to-create-post-quantum-cryptography-assessment-guidelines-participants-sought/"&gt;announced a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; to create PQC assessment guidelines to act as a roadmap for PQC transitions. It invited participants to take part in the effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When completed, the X9 guidelines might be used by organizations as a self-assessment tool, an informal assessment of a third-party service provider, or an independent assessment by a qualified information security professional, X9 said. An auditor or regulator might also refer to the assessment guidelines which could form a foundation for crypto agility standardization, it added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to have PQC assessment guidelines available before transitions are underway, for consistency to make the process as smooth as possible and the outcomes optimal,” says Michael Talley, chair of the X9F1 Cryptographic Tools working group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;X9 followed up with &lt;a href="https://x9.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/New-X9-Report-Supplies-Guidance-on-Migrating-to-Post-quantum-Cryptography-Safely-and-Cost-effectively-FINAL.pdf"&gt;guidance, aimed at financial industry management&lt;/a&gt;, on how to migrate to post-quantum cryptography “safely and cost effectively” in August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NCCoE addresses preparing for the adoption of new PQC algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April 2023, the US National Cybersecurity Council of Excellence (NCCoE), a collaboration of cybersecurity experts from the public and private sectors, released a draft publication addressing preparation for adopting new PQC algorithms. &lt;a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/news-insights/nccoe-releases-preliminary-draft-nist-sp-1800-38a-migration-post-quantum-cryptography"&gt;Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography&lt;/a&gt; extended the typical message of urgency to plan for migration seen in federal mandates to members of the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NCCoE said it would be engaging with industry collaborators, regulated industry sectors, and the US government to bring awareness to the issues involved in migrating to post-quantum algorithms and to prepare the crypto community for migration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;QuSecure pioneers live satellite quantum-resilient cryptographic communications link through space&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.qusecure.com/qusecure-launches-live-end-to-end-satellite-quantum-resilient-link-through-space/"&gt;quantum security vendor QuSecure claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have accomplished the first known live, end-to-end quantum-resilient cryptographic communications satellite link through space. It marked the first time US satellite data transmissions had been protected from classical and quantum decryption attacks using PQC, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The quantum-secure communication to space and back to Earth was made through a &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt; satellite working with a leading global system integrator (GSI) and security provider.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is significant because data shared between satellites and ground stations travels through the air and traditionally has been vulnerable to theft, leaving satellite communications even more accessible than typical internet communications, the vendor said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ietf-launches-working-group-to-coordinate-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-protocols"&gt;IETF launches working group to coordinate quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the IETF launched the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/"&gt;Post-Quantum Use In Protocols&lt;/a&gt; (PQUIP) working group to coordinate the use of cryptographic protocols that are not susceptible to large quantum computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The idea of the working group is to be a standing venue to discuss PQC from an operational and engineering side,” said Sofia Celi, co-chair of PQUI. “It is also a venue of last resort to discuss PQC-related issues in IETF protocols that have no associated maintenance on other working groups that the IETF has.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IETF said the working group has been set up on an experimental basis, and in two years, it intends to review it for rechartering to continue or else closure. In August 2023, the group published the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers/"&gt;Post-Quantum Cryptography for Engineers&lt;/a&gt; paper to provide an overview of the current threat landscape and the relevant algorithms designed to help prevent those threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September 2025, the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uta-pqc-app/"&gt;IETF published guidance&lt;/a&gt; for implementing post-quantum key exchanges and digital signatures in TLS 1.3 and related standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Migration roadmaps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agencies such as the &lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/pqc-migration-roadmap-unveiled"&gt;UK’s National Cyber Security Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2025/nist-pqc-the-road-ahead/images-media/rwcpqc-march2025-moody.pdf"&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and the &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/coordinated-implementation-roadmap-transition-post-quantum-cryptography"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; have outlined phased roadmaps for enterprises to complete migration to post-quantum cryptography by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts urge enterprises to prepare for PQC by taking an inventory of cryptographic assets, mapping algorithmic dependencies, and aligning migration plans to NIST’s post-quantum standards, among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/crypto-agility-considerations-migrating-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms"&gt;‘Migration to PQC’ project from NIST’s NCCoE&lt;/a&gt; has also brought much-needed structure to the process, especially with September’s white paper that mapped PQC discovery and migration capabilities to frameworks like the Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and NIST SP 800-53,” says Rik Ferguson, VP of security intelligence at Forescout. “That’s helping organizations understand where they stand and what practical steps to take.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074154/cisos-face-quantum-leap-in-prioritizing-quantum-resilience.html"&gt;adoption of post-quantum encryption technologies&lt;/a&gt; is building but remains uneven.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Around 8.5% of all SSH servers now support PQC key exchange, rising to 26% for OpenSSH specifically, but other technologies, such as TLS 1.3, are lagging behind,” according to Ferguson. “And when we look at unmanaged environments like IoT, OT, and medical devices, the numbers drop off sharply, often below 10%.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 7 agentic AI use cases for cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4079887/top-7-agentic-ai-use-cases-for-cybersecurity.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI promises to revolutionize a wide range of IT operations and services, including cybersecurity. While the technology, which accomplishes specific tasks with no human supervision, may seem intimidating to some CISOs, a growing number of cybersecurity leaders are discovering that agentic AI is less complex and easier to deploy than they initially believed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As agentic AI becomes more mature, its potential in cybersecurity is particularly compelling,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-mcleod-7a6a61b/"&gt;Sandra McLeod&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at Zoom, noting that many cybersecurity use cases are a strong fit for AI because they take advantage of the technology’s ability to operate at a scale and speed human teams can’t match.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI can process massive volumes of data continuously without experiencing fatigue, making it ideal for monitoring environments where human attention would eventually taper off, McLeod explains. “It’s especially useful for addressing problems that are either too large in scope or too low in priority for already-stretched security teams,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, AI’s ability to respond in real-time means it can act much faster than humans, helping to reduce the blast radius of an attack or minimize the time a threat remains undetected. “By handling high-volume or time-sensitive tasks, AI allows humans to focus on more strategic, higher-value work,” McLeod adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is your organization ready to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4064158/agentic-ai-in-it-security-where-expectations-meet-reality.html"&gt;add agentic AI&lt;/a&gt; to its cybersecurity arsenal? Here are seven top use cases for your consideration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-autonomous-threat-detection-and-response"&gt;1. Autonomous threat detection and response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A standout use case for agentic AI in cybersecurity is autonomous threat detection and response, which offers the ability to detect, protect, contain and recover from threats at unprecedented speed and scale, says &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/authors/john-scimone/"&gt;John Scimone&lt;/a&gt;, president and CSO at Dell Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This includes spotting and disrupting intrusion attempts autonomously in real-time by making security and IT changes to mitigate risks,” he explains. “Essentially, agentic AI can operate as a real-time, autonomous cyber defense agent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks will increasingly be &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053251/ai-powered-autonomous-ransomware-campaigns-are-coming-say-experts.html"&gt;executed by autonomous agents&lt;/a&gt; operating at the speed of light, far outpacing human response capabilities, Scimone says. The primary value of autonomous threat detection lies in speed and scale — two critical factors where traditional methods fall short. “Agentic AI will level the playing field by enabling defenders to respond with equal speed and expansive breadth,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3840447/security-operations-centers-are-fundamental-to-cybersecurity-heres-how-to-build-one.html"&gt;Security operations centers (SOCs)&lt;/a&gt; are a great use case for agentic AI because they serve as the frontline for detecting and responding to threats, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naresh-persaud-3791111/"&gt;Naresh Persaud&lt;/a&gt;, principal, cyber risk services, at Deloitte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With thousands of incidents to triage daily, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4056178/your-soc-is-the-parachute-will-it-open.html"&gt;SOCs are experiencing mounting alert fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. “Analysts can spend an average of 21 minutes or longer per ticket to remediate,” says Persaud, noting that documenting cases and collecting forensic data is a time-consuming task, while tracking vulnerabilities and user access anomalies can be a complex process. “What’s more, the volume of incidents is expected to rise as attackers increasingly employ AI to launch attacks on a broader scale.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Persaud believes that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042494/how-ai-is-reshaping-cybersecurity-operations.html"&gt;adding agentic AI to SOCs&lt;/a&gt; makes sense given that agents can be trained to handle detection, utilize &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/228501/natural-language-processing-nlp-explained.html"&gt;natural language processing (NLP)&lt;/a&gt; to produce case documentation, integrate with identity systems to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3822459/what-is-anomaly-detection-behavior-based-analysis-for-cyber-threats.html"&gt;correlate anomalous access&lt;/a&gt;, and perform automated remediation. “More important, agentic AI SOC analysts can allow SOCs to scale geometrically as work volume fluctuates.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-automated-triage-and-enriched-of-security-event-logs"&gt;3. Automated triage and enriched of security event logs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.radware.com/blog/author/pascalg/"&gt;Pascal Geenens&lt;/a&gt;, director of threat research for cybersecurity services firm Radware, says that automated triage, combined with enriched security event logs, form a strong AI agentic use case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Imagine an AI agent that autonomously collects indicators of compromise [IOCs] from multiple threat feeds, correlates them with internal telemetry, enriches the data with context from OSINT and CTI [cyber threat intelligence] repositories, and then drafts a structured alert for an analyst.” Instead of waiting for a SOC team to pivot manually across different platforms, the agent executes the pivoting automatically, flags anomalies, and prepares a recommended response playbook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geenens believes his suggested approach, like many agentic AI use cases presented here, addresses two major cybersecurity pain points: scale and speed. “Analysts are drowning in alerts and lack the time to connect dots across multiple sources,” he says. Agentic AI can effectively supplant repetitive, high-volume correlation tasks. More important, it closes the gap between detection and mitigation, enabling analysts to focus on validation and strategy rather than operations. “In practice, this doesn’t replace humans, but amplifies expertise while cutting through noise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-augmenting-security-talent"&gt;4. Augmenting security talent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another big problem in cybersecurity doesn’t involved technology — it’s the current talent gap, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3613339/cybersecuritys-oversimplification-problem-seeing-ai-as-a-replacement-for-human-agency.html"&gt;AI agents provide that most practical answer&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-ramachandran-in/"&gt;Rahul Ramachandran&lt;/a&gt;, generative AI product management director at Palo Alto Networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI agents can act as force multiplier for your swamped security teams, automating the endless maintenance needed to keep your security posture solid and troubleshooting complex issues across your many different security tools,” he explains. “This frees up your best people to focus on critical threats instead of manual, repetitive work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity talent gap isn’t a temporary trend — it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3810857/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-reality-we-need-to-face-the-challenge-of-emerging-tech.html"&gt;persistent reality&lt;/a&gt; we’ll be facing for years, Ramachandran warns. “You simply can’t hire your way out of this problem,” he adds. “Using AI agents is a strategic decision to invest in your existing team, making them more productive, more effective and, ultimately, happier.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-protecting-brands-against-fraud"&gt;5. Protecting brands against fraud&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fake domains have always been a headache, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarunasbruzas/?originalSubdomain=lt"&gt;Šarūnas Bružas&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of office equipment services provider Deskronic. “An AI agent can scan for new domain registrations that appear similar to your company, grab screenshots, perform WHOIS checks, and even draft takedown requests.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bružas reports that an AI agent recently helped him catch a phishing site in less than 20 minutes from launch. “That would have normally taken days, during which time customers could have lost data and money,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another strong use case is detecting scam ads on social media. “Scammers run Facebook or Instagram ads that impersonate your brand, and an AI agent can alert you immediately so you can have them taken down before too many customers click,” he adds&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such incidents happen quickly, and a manual team can’t keep up with the volume, Bružas says. Every hour a phishing site or scam ad is up increases the risk for fraud while damaging customer trust. “With agents always scanning for fake sites and ads, it will take less time to detect scams, and the human team is then free to focus on review instead of routine monitoring,” he notes. “In the end, this will make work smoother, limit the time attackers have to strike, and keep customers safer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-help-desk-support"&gt;6. Help desk support&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI agents can be used to automate common and repetitive help desk tasks, such as provisioning access to applications or troubleshooting authentication issues, freeing team members to respond quickly to requests that may not be as straightforward, says &lt;a href="https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/blog/author/ed-dunnahoeguidepointsecurity-com/"&gt;Ed Dunnahoe&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of innovation at cybersecurity services firm GuidePoint Security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the context of infrastructure, agents may also be able to speed-up the process of performing root cause analysis by parsing system logs more quickly, correlating results across data sources, and giving human engineers a major head start on their investigation,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-autonomous-real-time-zero-trust-policy-enforcement"&gt;7. Autonomous real-time zero-trust policy enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every end user has a unique profile, reflecting specific behaviors, privileges, and risk scores, says &lt;a href="https://www.druva.com/about/leadership/stephen-manley"&gt;Stephen Manley&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at cyber resilience platform provider Druva.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Agents can monitor those users and, if there’s a deviation, can push changes to what that user can access, force a re-authentication, or even temporarily sandbox that user,” he says. This becomes even more important, he adds, for organizations that are striving for &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/564201/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt;, “because you can have agents monitor non-human actors, such as other AI agents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Is your perimeter having an identity crisis?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080374/is-your-perimeter-having-an-identity-crisis.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, you’ve operated on a fundamental and fragile assumption that with enough training and the right tools, you could trust your employees to be the first line of defense. You taught them to spot the typos in phishing emails, to hover over suspicious links, to question the unusual requests and to report anything suspicious. However, the nature of identity, the bedrock of security models, is being systematically challenged. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re now living in a world of digital doppelgangers, enhanced by the emergence of gen-AI and fueled by the terabytes of personal data siphoned from countless security breaches. The threat is no longer just a well-crafted email. Threats can now speak with the voice of your CFO, write with the syntax of your Head of Legal and potentially send text messages that reference real and recent conversations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your digital life, including your employment history, your personal anecdotes from social media and your highly sensitive data, can become the raw material for your own malicious digital doppelgangers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider the recent wave of business email compromise attacks where attackers used &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI-generated voice messages to authorize fraudulent wire transfers&lt;/a&gt;. Or the sophisticated campaigns where &lt;a href="https://abnormal.ai/blog/bec-vec-attacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;threat actors scraped social media profiles &lt;/a&gt;to create messages that reference colleagues by name or recent company projects. These aren’t isolated incidents; they represent a serious shift in how attackers operate, with a much lower barrier to entry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What once required advanced technical skills and extensive investigating can now be achieved by anyone with access to widely available AI tools and the time to probe through public data about an individual, AKA: their target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-ai-is-automating-impersonation"&gt;How AI is automating impersonation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors are not just automating attacks; they are automating impersonation by leveraging AI to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craft phishing, smishing and vishing.&lt;/strong&gt; Creating hyper-personalized emails that can be grammatically perfect, contextually aware and emotionally resonant. These messages no longer demonstrate the telltale signs of traditional phishing like broken English or generic greetings.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synthesize trust.&lt;/strong&gt; Using voice-cloning AI to leave a quick, urgent voicemail from a trusted executive, bypassing the skepticism you’ve trained into your employees.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestrate multi-channel attacks.&lt;/strong&gt; An attack might start with a benign-looking text, be followed up by a seemingly legitimate email and culminate in a phone call that seals the deal. Each step reinforces the fabricated identity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit contextual awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; With access to your data, AI can now analyze your communication patterns, typical working hours, frequent contacts and even your writing style to create messages that feel authentically “you.” They can reference recent meetings, ongoing projects or shared experiences scraped from internal communications or social platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These capabilities aren’t theoretical — they’re operational today. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a severe identity crisis, not just for your employees, but for your infrastructure. When an attacker can convincingly mimic a trusted identity, your traditional defenses can begin to look alarmingly thin. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is critical, but what happens if the user is socially engineered into approving the push notification? Network segmentation is essential, but what if illegitimate credentials traverse those segments and are considered legitimate?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-security-mandate-default-to-distrust"&gt;Your security mandate, default to distrust &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This requires a fundamental mindset shift. Your mandate must be &lt;strong&gt;Never trust, always verify. &lt;/strong&gt;Your strategy must now pivot to a more dynamic, intelligent and identity-centric model:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assume compromise.&lt;/strong&gt; You should operate as if the initial point of entry has already been breached. Your focus should shift from solely prevention to rapid detection and response as well. It’s no longer just about keeping them out; it’s about finding them the second they’re in.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical visibility.&lt;/strong&gt; You cannot fight an enemy you cannot see. You need unified visibility across every touchpoint, from the endpoint to the network core, from the cloud instance to the mobile device. You need to see not just traffic, but behavior. Is this user acting like the real person? Why is the CFO suddenly accessing files from an anomalous geolocation at 3 am?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modernize authentication.&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations should aggressively move towards phishing-resistant authentication methods like &lt;a href="https://fidoalliance.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FIDO2&lt;/a&gt;, which can help make it harder to steal the ‘keys to the kingdom.’&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harness intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage threat intelligence that is broad, deep and predictive. As I know from my own organization’s work on the annual &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:vbg:intl:UKResourcesDBIR&amp;amp;ds_cid=22031141982_ds_agid=173907107004&amp;amp;utm_medium=knc&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_campaign=BNDUKUnlimited&amp;amp;utm_term=verizon%20dbir&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22031141982&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4nhFGexbrYU4jXD0iFT1gzW3fI3&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw3OjGBhDYARIsADd-uX7gdqmy6BfVfxclnFH0gGpI7oV2haT4NO43-9sV-NradJA3XZFyepQaAvX3EALw_wcB" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon Business Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)&lt;/a&gt;, understanding the overarching tactics and techniques of your adversaries is paramount to building a defense that anticipates, rather than just reacts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This identity crisis is a defining challenge of your generation of security leaders. You are no longer just protecting data; you are defending the concept of legitimate identity against an autonomous, tireless adversary. The path forward requires the courage to fight AI with AI and the vision to build resilient, identity-first security frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And just as you began to grapple with this, the next evolution is already looming: Agentic AI — autonomous systems capable of independent reasoning and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-next-frontier-agentic-ai"&gt;The next frontier: Agentic AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current generative AI models require a human operator, and they can generate a flawless email or clone a voice on command. Agentic AI has the potential to become an almost-independent threat actor. Given a simple goal, agentic agents can independently reason, plan and execute the complex, multi-step attack required to achieve malicious goals. This autonomous threat actor can operate 24/7, adapt to obstacles in near real-time and scale its operations with terrifying efficiency. Human defenders are now against agentic threat actors that do not sleep and can execute a sophisticated campaign at a speed and scale you have never witnessed before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the question you must all now ask yourself is not if your employees will be targeted by a digital doppelgänger, but how quickly you will be able to tell the difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As you prepare to defend against malicious AI agents, you must also consider the security implications of deploying your own. This requires applying a familiar security principle: the principle of least privilege. You wouldn’t give a new employee the keys to the entire kingdom, and the same logic must apply to AI. An agent’s access to networks and data must be strictly circumscribed by its role and context, operating within a well-defined hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Implementing secure agentic AI requires establishing clear guardrails from the outset. Assign explicit limitations for each agent. Establish a process that can enable an immediate shutdown if agents begin operating outside defined parameters. Monitor and log every action, allowing for close reviews of any unusual behaviors. Most critically, maintain close human oversight over agent patterns and outcomes — with feedback loops that allow your security team to identify when there may be manipulation at play or when decision-making processes yield unexpected results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, just as you train your human teams to recognize and resist social engineering, you must continuously test the resilience of your AI agents. This is where red teaming becomes critical, not just for your infrastructure, but for your own autonomous systems, helping to verify that they cannot be tricked by an adversary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations that can strike this balance will be best positioned to both secure and defend against autonomous systems in this new reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fake number, real damage: Europol urges action against caller ID spoofing</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/fake-number-real-damage-europol-urges-action-against-caller-id-spoofing</link>
      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <description>Between 1 and 2 October, the Colombian Police (Policia Nacional de Colombia) and the Spanish Guardia Civil, supported by Europol, targeted five key suspects, linked to the so-called Clan del Golfo, allegedly responsible for whole-sale cocaine trafficking operations from South America to Europe. In particular, the criminal network oversaw first-hand the production, transportation and distribution of cocaine throughout the entire logistics chains. To support field activities on the action day, Europol deployed two experts to Colombia and Spain.</description>

      <title>Tips for CISOs switching between industries</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4079956/tips-for-cisos-switching-between-industries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the outside, when someone reaches CISO level, the move to the next role should be easy. After all, they’ve already made it to the top. But many security leaders find the opposite is true. Once they’re in a certain industry, it’s harder to get out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Executives and recruiters often assume a CISO’s experience only translates within their current sector. First Bank CISO Marc Ashworth, whose career has spanned aerospace, healthcare and finance, has seen it happen repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You see people staying within the same industry … it seems like those in the startup world stay in the startup world, those in software development stay there. Once you get to larger enterprises, you tend to stay in those larger enterprises. Whereas, if you’re in a small or medium business, it’s harder to break into a larger enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perception isn’t arbitrary, rather it’s rooted in how executive hiring works, according to Sal DiFranco, global advanced technology managing partner at talent advisory firm DHR Global. “Back in the day, you stayed in your vertical. You were an industrial person, you were a retail person, you were a telecom person, you were a software person. You stayed in your lane and that’s what it was.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DiFranco highlights the convergence of technology in the last 15 years has started to shift this perception. He says enterprise technologies has become more standardized across industries, allowing CISOs to move more freely between sectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Technology has become pervasive across all industries,” he says. But DiFranco warns that opportunity alone isn’t enough, CISOs still need to actively reframe why they’re suitable for a role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So how can CISOs move across sectors successfully, and prove their skills are transferable?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-consulting-to-finding-similarities-between-different-industries"&gt;From consulting to finding similarities between different industries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building a transferable skill set is essential for those looking to switch industries. For Dell’s first-ever CISO, Tim Youngblood, adaptability was never a luxury but a requirement. His early years as a consultant at KPMG gave him a front-row seat to the challenges of multiple industries before he ever moved into cybersecurity. Those early years also taught Youngblood that while every industry has its own nuances, the core security principles remain constant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always believed that variety is the spice of life,” he says. “I worked for KPMG for several years, servicing 30 different clients a year in multiple industries, oil and gas, healthcare, financial services, you name it. As my career progressed, I took a lot of those key learnings from my consulting days. I felt comfortable I could go work for any company in any industry and be successful with what I knew.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Youngblood, Ashworth’s consulting business became his superpower. He says it gave him the ability to switch from working between different verticals without losing sight of his key objectives of identifying risk and finding solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Youngblood also points to engaging with industry-specific information-sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) whether it be healthcare, financial, retail, or even maritime. “These groups were initiated by the government to enable public-private sector sharing, and it’s a great avenue to take to understand how other industries solve the same problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a recruitment perspective, the best shot anyone can have if they’re moving from a consulting background is moving across to a CISO role that’s with one of their clients, which DiFranco says is common. “Because you’re a known commodity and they’ve seen how you work. They’ll be able to say you’re consultative, you’re strategic, and knows how to deliver on a strategy. I’ve seen them in action, and I’m willing to give them a shot to come into the enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs without consulting experience, but who still want to switch verticals, DiFranco recommends identifying sectors with structural similarities or adjacent industries because they’re the easiest transition. He describes this kind of moves as “baby steps” toward a bigger vertical shift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Take someone from pharmaceutical and put them into a healthcare organization. They’re not the same models, and a lot of things are different, but the infrastructure of those companies, from a technology perspective, are similar. You’re still dealing with the regulated environment and all of the things that go into regulation when it comes to technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understand-and-demonstrate-achieved-results"&gt;Understand and demonstrate achieved results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making the jump into a new industry isn’t about matching past job titles but about proving you can create impact in a new context. DiFranco says the key is to demonstrate relevance early.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I pitch a candidate, I explain what they did, how they did it, and what their impact was to their organization in their specific industry,” he says. “If what they did and how they did it, and what their impact was on the organization resonates where that company wants to go, they’re a lot more likely to say, ‘I don’t really care where this person comes from because they did exactly what I want done in this organization’. It’s about the results, but it’s about articulating the results of how you’re going to do it if you come into a different industry.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Youngblood took this approach when he moved from being the CISO at Kimberly-Clark to McDonald’s. “On the outside, everybody sees the golden arches, and they all have the same look and feel,” he says. “But on the back end there are joint ventures, conventional licenses, and country licensees. When you’re the CISO, you have to try and bring everybody together, even though they operate slightly differently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond operational structures, Youngblood also had to adapt quickly to industry-specific threats. “At T-Mobile, SIM swapping is a huge issue in the telecom industry. Most people don’t realize how frequent it’s happening. It’s a billion-dollar industry, sometimes nation-state funded. Some of them are in the back office and directly taking over the identity of a person, which can cause a lot of damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Cyber Self-Defense CEO Michael Meline, whose career originally started in law enforcement before he stepped into cybersecurity in financial services and then healthcare, the fastest way to build credibility in a new sector is to deeply understand the risk landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got a lot of the same risks, so it really is risk management. I don’t care what field you’re in, my intent in dealing with cybersecurity is to go in, identify the risks, and then build a plan to mitigate them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating you understand the risk landscape can give candidates a significant edge. “Outline where you think your skills are transferable from the industry you’re in to what you know about the other industries you might be interested in, and then let’s start talking through examples of what you’ve done in your industry and how we think it can relate to the industries you’re talking about targeting and we would build from there,” says DiFranco.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="avoid-getting-pigeonholed"&gt;Avoid getting pigeonholed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest career risk for many CISOs isn’t burnout or data breach, it’s being seen as a one-industry operator. Ashworth’s advice is to focus on demonstrating transferable skills. “It’s a matter of getting whatever job you’re applying for, to realise that those principles are the same, no matter what industry you’re in. Whether it’s aerospace, healthcare, or finance, the principles are the same. Show that, and you’ll avoid being pigeonholed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Meline, avoiding being pigeonholed starts before moving into a new industry, by focusing on risk first and then learning about the business. “As I’ve progressed throughout my career, what I’ve discovered is cybersecurity is nothing more than risk management. As a cop, I would identify risk and take the appropriate steps to mitigate it,” he says. “It’s the same thing when I deal with risk in the corporate world. I’m working with stakeholders all the way from the bottom of the organization to the top and collaborating on how we deal with this risk, and then build the right plan to address the risk in a way that meets the needs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, DiFranco says the key is showing relevance and being able to draw parallels across industries. “It boils down to the uniqueness of the candidate and drawing your analogies of how close you are to those other industries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cybercrime-as-a-service takedown: 7 arrested</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity management for boards: Metrics that matter</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4081319/cybersecurity-management-for-boards-metrics-that-matter.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware doesn’t schedule a meeting with your CISO. It hits your core systems, deletes your backups and leaks your data. And while the security team races to contain the breach, your board is left with a more pressing question: How bad is it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most boards don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patch counts, firewall logs and threat feeds bury them. None of which says anything about business impact or recovery time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This gap between technical noise and executive insight is dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We expect boards to govern cybersecurity the same way they oversee finance: with clarity, accountability and foresight. But you can’t govern what you can’t measure. And most cyber metrics today are built for engineers, not executives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.informationweek.com/cyber-resilience/measure-success-key-cybersecurity-resilience-metrics#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThese%20include%20mean%20time%20to,preventing%20threats.%E2%80%9D%20Kellerman%20adds." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyber resilience metrics&lt;/a&gt; translate cyber risk into something boards can act on: financial exposure, operational resilience and readiness for tomorrow’s threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the only metrics that matter to rewire your boardroom dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cyber-resilience-%e2%89%a0-cybersecurity"&gt;Cyber resilience ≠ cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boards love clarity. Traditional security metrics throw vulnerabilities, incidents and patch SLAs at you; numbers that scream “busy” but whisper “value.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesstechweekly.com/legal-and-compliance/iso27001-certification/cyber-resilience-vs-cyber-security/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyber resilience shifts the conversation&lt;/a&gt;. It asks: How fast can we bounce back? What’s the cost of downtime? Who owns recovery?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security focuses on threats. Resilience measures response and survival is the ultimate goal. That’s the mindset shift boards need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reporting 1,200 blocked phishing attempts says nothing. But telling the board that your business can recover operations within four hours of a ransomware attack, now that’s a metric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-does-this-matter"&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resilience aligns with your actual business goals: continuity, trust and long-term value. It reflects your appetite for risk and your ability to adapt. And with regulations like DORA and NIS2 pushing accountability higher up the ladder, your board is on the hook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="financial-impact-and-continuity-metrics"&gt;Financial impact and continuity metrics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t fight cyber chaos with &lt;a href="https://securityscorecard.com/blog/9-cybersecurity-metrics-kpis-to-track/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technical metrics&lt;/a&gt; alone. Boards speak in &lt;a href="https://peris.ai/post/tracking-the-financial-impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-business-operations#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20is%20no%20longer%20just,track%20and%20mitigate%20risks%20effectively." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;financial impact&lt;/a&gt;, not firewall rules. Here’s what gets attention:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average cost per incident.&lt;/strong&gt; Know your burn rate. A ransomware attack that costs $2M in downtime, recovery and lost customers speaks louder than 400 blocked IPs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downtime costs&lt;/strong&gt;. How long can you survive offline? Calculate cost per minute for critical systems and quantify risk exposure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer churn post-incident.&lt;/strong&gt; A breach doesn’t just hit the wallet; it hits reputation. Measure the churn rate 90 days post-breach and tie it to customer trust.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MTTR (mean time to recovery).&lt;/strong&gt; Speed is your insurance policy. Can your team recover operations within SLAs or does every incident spiral into a crisis?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security spend ROI.&lt;/strong&gt; For every dollar spent on controls, what’s the risk reduction achieved? This helps your board back investments with confidence and challenge waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These metrics turn cyber resilience into business resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="governance-and-compliance-performance-indicators"&gt;Governance and compliance performance indicators&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/training/cyber-governance/Assurance_and_Oversight/NCSC-CyberGovernanceforBoards-AssuranceandOversight-v5.1-Web/index.html#/page/67b88ffde4cc15e24fc12bb0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyber governance&lt;/a&gt; isn’t a policy PDF buried in SharePoint. It’s how well your people, processes and partners follow through. And yes, it’s measurable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory violations.&lt;/strong&gt; Fines are the easy part; the real cost is shareholder trust. Track violations, root causes and days to remediation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training completion rates.&lt;/strong&gt; If only 40% of staff complete phishing training, your most significant risk isn’t external. It’s cultural.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Measure how often teams bypass controls. Every exception is a governance blind spot.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party assessments.&lt;/strong&gt; If your vendor can’t spell “MFA,” you’re outsourcing liability, not risk. Track security ratings, SLAs and contract clauses tied to resilience.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maturity assessments.&lt;/strong&gt; Align with NIST, ISO or DORA frameworks. Show year-on-year growth in maturity; don’t just say “we’re improving.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boards don’t need to run the cyber program. They need evidence that it’s working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="operational-resilience-and-response-effectiveness"&gt;Operational resilience and response effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t prevent every breach. But how your systems respond when under fire is the actual test of cyber health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean time to detection (MTTD).&lt;/strong&gt; How long does it take to spot trouble? Faster detection = smaller blast radius.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False-positive rates.&lt;/strong&gt; If your SOC is drowning in noise, real threats will slip through. Measure alert fidelity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident escalation time.&lt;/strong&gt; Track how long it takes between detection and decision-making. Lag kills.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical system uptime.&lt;/strong&gt; Boards care less about alerts and more about outcomes. If core systems stayed online during a breach, that’s the story they need to hear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response plan testing.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t wait for a real breach to test your playbook. Run tabletop exercises. Report readiness scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are the metrics that move you from panic to poise in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strategic-risk-and-future-readiness-metrics"&gt;Strategic risk and future readiness metrics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t build resilience looking in the rearview mirror. The smartest boards ask: &lt;a href="https://www.kovrr.com/blog-post/what-cybersecurity-metrics-should-i-report-to-my-board" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Are we ready for what’s next&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Residual risk levels.&lt;/strong&gt; After implementing all controls and mitigations, what remains? Track it. Own it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat landscape mapping.&lt;/strong&gt; Know your enemies. What trends are shaping your sector? Where are attackers investing? How exposed are you?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security talent retention.&lt;/strong&gt; If your best analysts leave every 12 months, you’re bleeding resilience.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill gap analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have the capabilities to handle AI threats? Quantum risks? Deepfake scams? If not, when will you?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation readiness.&lt;/strong&gt; Every digital transformation brings shadow risk. Boards must monitor security integration across cloud, AI and automation initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These metrics future-proof your decisions. They don’t just report risk; they predict it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-govern-it"&gt;If you can’t measure it, you can’t govern it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber resilience is a boardroom imperative, not a side project. But if your metrics still read like a SOC dashboard, you’re measuring the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need metrics that speak your language:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial metrics tell you what risk costs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Governance metrics show if the culture holds&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Operational metrics reveal real-time resilience&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Strategic metrics test your readiness for tomorrow&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And resilience metrics connect it all back to the business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your job isn’t to become a CISO. It’s to ask sharper questions. Demand clearer answers. Push for metrics that expose blind spots, not bury them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audit your current board metrics. What do they tell you?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Define 1–2 metrics per category that align with your risk appetite.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Set expectations for reporting cadence and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Iterate. Improve. Adapt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Metrics don’t just reflect resilience. Done right, they drive it. Ask yourself: If ransomware hit tomorrow, would your board know how strong your cyber posture is?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Typo hackers sneak cross-platform credential stealer into 10 npm packages</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4081790/typo-hackers-sneak-cross-platform-credential-stealer-into-10-npm-packages.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a newly disclosed multi-stage supply-chain campaign, a threat actor published ten typosquatted npm packages that mimicked popular libraries to deploy a cross-platform credential stealer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a Socket analysis, the packages were published on July 4 and had collectively amassed nearly 10000 downloads in four months before being flagged for removal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Each package leverages npm’s postinstall hook to execute immediately upon installation, launching in a new terminal window to avoid detection during the install process,” Socket researchers noted in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once installed, these packages automatically launch a fake CAPTCHA prompt, tricking developers into believing it is part of a legitimate installation process. In parallel, the attack chain fingerprints the victim’s IP address and retrieves a PyInstaller-packed binary designed to harvest credentials from keyrings, browsers, SSH keys, API tokens, and cloud configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="npm-postinstall-script-with-obfuscation"&gt;npm postinstall script with obfuscation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malicious packages exploit a built-in npm lifecycle, the postinstall script, to kick off the attack without any additional user steps. Socket found these packages were designed to detect which operating system they were running on and then automatically open a new terminal window to launch the hidden malware script.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By running the payload in a separate window, the actor masks the activity from install logs, researchers &lt;a href="https://socket.dev/blog/10-npm-typosquatted-packages-deploy-credential-harvester" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the JavaScript payload opens a fake CAPTCHA using Node’s readline and prints convincing messages such as “installing discord.js package..” with realistic version numbers and contributor counts. This social engineering step both delays obvious connections to npm install and can confuse developers and automated defenders into thinking the package is performing benign setup work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Socket’s analysis also showed the JavaScript itself is deeply obfuscated across four distinct layers–an IIFE self-decoder, an XOR cipher keyed from the decoder source, URI encoded payload text, and control-flow obfuscation using mixed numeral bases–making static detection and casual code review substantially harder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This malware demonstrates multiple advanced techniques rarely seen together in npm supply chain attacks,” the researchers said. “The campaign combines four layers of obfuscation, social engineering via fake CAPTCHA and fake legitimate package installations, and automated execution with no additional user interaction after the fake CAPTCHA prompt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Payload for IP fingerprinting and credential theft&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the fake CAPTCHA interaction occurs, the installer sends the victim’s IP address to the attacker’s server, a step that allows tracking, geofencing, and exclusion of unwanted targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It then downloads the payload from the same host, which is a 24 MB Pyinstaller-packed application that contains hundreds of thousands of strings and multiple binaries, indicating a feature-rich stealer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Socket further analyzed the binaries to perform aggressive filesystem and credential harvest, targeting browser password stores and cookies, SSH keys, OS keyrings (Windows Credential Manager, macOS keychain, Linux SecretService), cloud config files, SDK tokens, and other artifacts that can lead to “long-terms access” to code repositories, cloud consoles, and corporate resources. Exfiltration transfers the data to the threat actor’s host, providing a central collection point for harvested secrets. Socket has published a full list of the ten malicious package names, their hashes, and the attacker’s associated email address to help developers and defenders identify potential compromises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Popular libraries typosquatted in the campaign include TypeScript, discord.js, ethers.js, nodemon, react-router-dom, and zustand. npm’s popularity has made it a growing target for imposter packages, with abusers conducting massive &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3995813/hackers-drop-60-npm-bombs-in-less-than-two-weeks-to-recon-dev-machines.html"&gt;espionage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053725/massive-npm-supply-chain-attack-hits-18-popular-packages-with-2b-weekly-downloads.html"&gt;supply-chain&lt;/a&gt; attacks in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Chromium flaw crashes Chrome, Edge, Atlas: Researcher publishes exploit after Google’s silence</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4081831/chromium-flaw-crashes-chrome-edge-atlas-researcher-publishes-exploit-after-googles-silence.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A vulnerability in Chromium’s rendering engine can crash Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and seven other browsers within seconds if exploited by attackers, a security researcher warned after Google ignored his vulnerability report for two months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jose Pino published proof-of-concept code for the flaw on October 29, potentially exposing more than three billion users to browser crashes and system instability. The vulnerability exploits a fundamental design weakness in Blink, the rendering engine that powers all Chromium-based browsers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timing raises uncomfortable questions about Google’s vulnerability response process. Pino reported the flaw on August 28 and followed up on August 30. He received no response before deciding to publish his research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I decided to publish this PoC to draw attention to a severe issue affecting broad internet users after my initial report two months ago went unanswered,” Pino said in &lt;a href="https://github.com/jofpin/brash" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technical documentation published on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe public awareness is necessary when responsible disclosure does not produce timely mitigation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google, Microsoft, and seven other affected browser vendors, including Opera and Vivaldi, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-attack-works"&gt;How the attack works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability, which Pino called Brash, exploits the complete absence of rate limiting on document.title API updates in Blink. By flooding the browser with millions of title changes per second, an attacker can saturate the main thread and force a crash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The attack vector originates from the complete absence of rate limiting on document.title API updates,” Pino wrote in the technical document. “This allows injecting millions of DOM mutations per second, and during this injection attempt, it saturates the main thread, disrupting the event loop and causing the interface to collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exploit affects Chromium versions 143.0.7483.0 and earlier. Pino tested 11 browsers across macOS, Windows, Linux, and Android. Nine proved vulnerable: Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Arc, Dia, Opera, Perplexity Comet, ChatGPT Atlas, and Brave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Firefox and Safari emerged unscathed. Both use different rendering engines — Gecko and WebKit, respectively — that don’t share Blink’s architectural flaw. All iOS browsers also escaped because Apple requires them to use WebKit, Pino added in the document.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Pino’s testing, the exploit produced a predictable collapse timeline. Zero to five seconds triggered extreme CPU consumption. Five to 10 seconds froze tabs completely. Ten to 15 seconds produced browser collapse or “Page Unresponsive” dialogs. Fifteen to 60 seconds required forced termination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="beyond-desktop-crashes-enterprise-automation-at-risk"&gt;Beyond desktop crashes: enterprise automation at risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While crashed browsers disrupt individual users, the vulnerability poses greater risks to enterprise automation. Organizations running headless Chromium browsers for AI agents, trading systems, or operational monitoring face potential workflow paralysis, the document stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pino’s documentation outlined several enterprise attack scenarios. AI agents querying compromised websites could crash mid-analysis, halting automated trading decisions. Fraud detection dashboards could collapse during peak transaction periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Web-based surgical navigation systems could fail during critical procedures. “The browser process collapses, stopping the entire analysis pipeline,” according to the research documentation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pino’s proof-of-concept code included scheduling parameters that let attackers trigger crashes at specific times. An attacker could inject the code with a time delay, letting it lie dormant until a critical moment—market opening, shift change, peak operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A critical feature that amplifies Brash’s danger is its ability to be programmed to execute at specific moments,” Pino’s documentation stated. “An attacker can inject the code with a temporal trigger, remaining dormant until a predetermined exact time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-disclosure-breaks-down"&gt;When disclosure breaks down&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google’s silence on Pino’s report highlights persistent tensions in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/550736/responsible-disclosure-cyber-security-ethics.html"&gt;vulnerability disclosure&lt;/a&gt;. Google’s own Project Zero team enforces a strict 90-day disclosure deadline, the industry standard, for vulnerabilities it discovers in third-party software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s &lt;a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/vrp-faq.md" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chrome Vulnerability Reward Program documentation&lt;/a&gt; pledges to “respond promptly and fix bugs in a sensible timeframe.” It states that most security bugs are automatically opened for public access 14 weeks after fixes are committed to Chromium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that timeline assumes vendors respond. Pino received no acknowledgment of his August 28 report. His two-month wait fell well short of the 90-day standard, yet exceeded what many researchers consider reasonable when facing vendor silence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disclosure debate has raged for years. Microsoft once &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/550236/microsoft-blasts-google-for-vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html"&gt;criticized Google&lt;/a&gt; for publishing Windows vulnerabilities before patches were ready, calling it a “gotcha” that left customers exposed. Yet vendors that don’t respond leave researchers with few options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pino noted another complication. “The problem is more serious than it seems, since each company that uses Chromium has customized functionalities, which leads me to believe that the fix must be independent for each one,” he said in the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google addressed at least six Chrome zero-day vulnerabilities in 2024, according to the company&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt;s security advisories. But this architectural flaw in Blink has received no public acknowledgment. The Chromium project’s public issue tracker contained no entries matching the vulnerability as of October 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Brave, and other affected vendors had issued no security advisories by press time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="limited-options-for-enterprise-security-teams"&gt;Limited options for enterprise security teams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CIOs face difficult choices. The vulnerability affects Blink’s core, so standard browser hardening measures — content security policies, site isolation, extension restrictions — provide no protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pino’s proof-of-concept code remained publicly accessible on GitHub under Creative Commons and MIT licenses. The documentation included disclaimers limiting use to educational and security research in controlled environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also published a live demonstration at brash.run that executed the exploit against visitors’ browsers. The code included configurable intensity settings ranging from “moderate” observation modes to “extreme” instant collapse configurations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The documentation specified that the exploit would cease working once vendors patched the vulnerability. But without response timelines from Google or other browser makers, enterprise security teams have no way to plan their defenses or communicate risks to business units that depend on browser-based workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The silence leaves a critical question unanswered: When vendors don’t respond to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570573/6-tips-for-receiving-and-responding-to-third-party-security-disclosures.html"&gt;properly disclosed vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;, how long should researchers wait before warning the public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Strengthening security with a converged security and networking platform</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4079505/strengthening-security-with-a-converged-security-and-networking-platform-2.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s IT environment of multiple clouds, hybrid work, and the exploding popularity of AI has given cybercriminals unprecedented opportunities for launching attacks — and the traditional arsenal of tools organizations use to stop them isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The network perimeter has disappeared, and every new device, app, cloud connection, and AI tool expands the threat surface. Not surprisingly, the &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T10b/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf"&gt;2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report&lt;/a&gt; found a 34% increase in the number of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities to gain network access and cause security breaches. Cybercriminals are also extending their reach by selling ransomware kits on the dark web and blasting out targeted, AI-generated phishing messages and malware at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, organizations are doing what they’ve done for years, adding to the dozens of separate point products they use to manage various aspects of security. These range from network security tools like next-gen firewalls, secure web gateways, and intrusion prevention systems to identity and access management systems, endpoint protection platforms, and cloud access security brokers to encryption servers, data loss prevention tools, threat detection and response systems, and more…the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The irony is, while many of these point systems work well on their own, deploying and managing them separately has &lt;em&gt;created &lt;/em&gt;new security risks. Products are designed with different fundamental security assumptions. Each has a separate security policy and requires a specially trained administrator, making it difficult to coordinate security policies and use products together.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a fragmented security infrastructure with inconsistent rules and poor visibility. Conflicting policies and uneven enforcement create the gaps cybercriminals love to exploit. Teams struggle to identify incoming threats, and critical minutes, hours, or even days elapse as they correlate datasets and develop a response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This system is no match for today’s fast-moving, multifaceted threat environment. To deliver effective protection, organizations need to move from scattered tools to a unified platform. Uniting networking and security on a single platform reduces blind spots and provides full, real-time threat visibility across traffic, users, applications, and devices. When a platform is built right — with security and networking natively integrated — it can react to threats faster and apply inline and consistent policy enforcement in real time — everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, not every “unified platform” lives up to its name, and CISOs must be aware of the differences. Building a fully integrated platform is tough, and many vendors simply bolt together different products that operate separately. Others offer “platformized” solutions, refactoring and integrating acquired products that may work today, but can’t adapt to tomorrow’s innovations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VersaONE, a universal secure access service edge (SASE) platform, takes a different approach with a natively integrated platform that allows security teams to move beyond the limits of fragmented, static tools. Built-in AI continuously correlates massive volumes of network and security data, identifies anomalies and threats across the environment, and responds to incidents at machine speed. A single software stack enforces a unified policy framework for all users, devices, applications, and threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero trust network access at the heart of the platform ensures that no user, device, or application is implicitly trusted — ever. Instead, access is granted and modified based on real-time factors, such as identity, device posture, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, users, devices, and applications are isolated into controlled microsegments, significantly reducing the risk of lateral movement and privilege escalation if an attacker breaches the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VersaONE is the future of security — an adaptive, easy-to-use, fully integrated platform. Versa’s Universal SASE approach represents a major leap forward from disjointed point solutions, just as cloud-based software supplanted the old castle-and-moat approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malicious packages in npm evade dependency detection through invisible URL links: Report</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082195/malicious-packages-in-npm-evade-dependency-detection-through-invisible-url-links-report.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors are finding new ways to insert invisible code or links into open source code to evade detection of software supply chain attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest example was found by researchers at Israel-based Koi Security, who this week said they have &lt;a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/phantomraven-npm-malware-hidden-in-invisible-dependencies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discovered a threat actor’s campaign&lt;/a&gt; that has been running since August, contaminating 126 packages in Microsoft’s npm open source code repository. There have been more than a combined 86,000 installs of these infected packages, and the campaign is continuing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s the trick? The bad packages don’t contain malicious code that could be detected by a scanner. Instead, there’s an invisible link to a URL that, when the package is installed by a developer, fetches malicious code from the attacker’s server.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The invisible dependency could be hidden behind a line that simply says ‘Hello.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you install a package with this kind of dependency, npm fetches it from that external URL,” the researchers note. “Not from npmjs.com, from wherever the attacker wants. And npmjs.com doesn’t follow those URLs. Security scanners don’t fetch them. Dependency analysis tools ignore them. To every automated security system, these packages show “0 Dependencies.” So, to the developer who downloaded an infected package from npm, the package looks safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-does-it-work"&gt;Why does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This works, say the researchers, because npm supports HTTP URLs as dependency specifiers, so when the malicious package is installed, npm automatically fetches it from the external URL.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal: To steal developer GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins and other credentials, and to obtain an outline of the developer’s environment – including public IP addresses, server hostnames, usernames, current directories and node.js version – for further exploitation. The data is then carefully exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="campaign-also-exploits-ai"&gt;Campaign also exploits AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The names of packages uploaded to npm aren’t typosquats of common packages, a popular tactic of threat actors. Instead the hackers exploit AI hallucinations. When developers ask AI assistants for package recommendations, the chatbots sometimes suggest plausible-sounding names that are close to those of legitimate packages, but that don’t actually exist. These are the names the threat actor uses. So if a developer asks an AI assistant about a package called ‘eslint-plugin-unused-imports’ the chatbot might suggest the (unknowingly malicious) ‘unusued-imports’ package, and the developer might trust the recommendation and install that package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koi Security calls the tactic slopsquatting. They call the overall campaign PhantomRaven.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At some point, npm leadership either discovered this campaign on its own or was alerted by other researchers, because in August, 21 packages were removed from the repository. However, after September, 80 additional packages were uploaded. All, Koi Security believes, were clearly controlled by the same person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="disastrous-flaw-in-npm"&gt;‘Disastrous’ flaw in npm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a “disastrous” systemic design flaw in npm’s dependency management functionality, &lt;a href="https://shehackspurple.ca/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tanya Janca&lt;/a&gt;, head of Canadian secure coding training firm She Hacks Purple Consulting, told &lt;em&gt;CSO. &lt;/em&gt;The lack of validation for dependency URLs bypasses the trust boundary for the Node.js software supply chain, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few programming languages allow dependencies to be specified via URLs, and even most of those that do have package managers that block this feature due to security concerns, she said. For instance, she pointed out, it’s allowed in Python, but the open source Python Package Index repository of packages (PyPI) blocks this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The danger of the PhantomRaven attacks is that an threat actor can compromise developer and build systems, rather than end users directly, Janca said. “Because Node.js and npm are used by millions of projects, even a single compromised package can have cascading effects across that entire software ecosystem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack is called an ‘unvalidated redirect’ [accepting an untrusted URL as data] and was on the &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP) Top Ten &lt;/a&gt;attacks as far back as in 2013, Janca said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Input validation is the number one most important step in all secure coding practices, and this feature of npm circumventing the developer’s ability to even be aware that this is happening is terrifying. This attack vector is likely to be use by many attackers in the near future until this is removed by npm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was asked to comment on the Koi report and asked how it will better secure npm. A spokesperson said they were working on a reply but none had been received by publication deadline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="invisible-attacks"&gt;‘Invisible’ attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors have been using invisible code to fool defenders in many ways. For example, in August, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4043693/hackers-can-slip-ghost-commands-into-the-amazon-q-developer-vs-code-extension.html" target="_blank"&gt;a security blogger reported&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon’s Q Developer service could be fooled by invisible Unicode Tag characters. In another case, Unicode &lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4076668/self-propagating-worm-found-in-marketplaces-for-visual-studio-code-extensions.html" target="_blank"&gt;was used to hide malware&lt;/a&gt; in Visual Studio code extensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orenyomtov/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oren Yomtov&lt;/a&gt;, author of the Koi Security report, said that Microsoft should enhance npm’s scanning tools to follow and analyze remote dependency URLs rather than ignoring them. Currently, security scanners don’t fetch HTTP URL dependencies, and dependency analysis tools ignore them, he said, making packages with remote dynamic dependencies appear to have “0 Dependencies.” Microsoft should also require security validation for any externally fetched dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers shouldn’t blindly trust AI tools for package recommendations, he added. As the report points out, when developers ask AI assistants like GitHub Copilot or IDEs like Cursor for package recommendations, the models sometimes suggest plausible-sounding package names that don’t actually exist. PhantomRaven took advantage of this, and created malicious versions of those non-existent packages. “Always verify packages exist on the official npm registry before installation,” he advised, “and audit package.json files for suspicious HTTP URL dependencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, CSOs should have endpoint visibility into all software types, not just traditional binaries. “PhantomRaven demonstrates how sophisticated attackers exploit blind spots in traditional security tooling, as remote dynamic dependencies aren’t visible to static analysis,” he said. “Implement governance controls across the entire software intake surface, including code packages, extensions, and AI models that traditional MDMs and EDRs miss.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>AI-powered bug hunting shakes up bounty industry — for better or worse</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082265/ai-powered-bug-hunting-shakes-up-bounty-industry-for-better-or-worse.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI-powered bug hunting has changed the calculus of what makes for an effective bounty program by accelerating vulnerability discovery — and subjecting code maintainers to ballooning volumes of AI flaw-hunting slop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security researchers are using large language models (LLMs) to automate reconnaissance, reverse engineer APIs, and scan codebases faster than ever. By applying AI tools to techniques ranging from fuzzing and exploit automation to pattern recognition across codebases and websites, researchers are discovering flaws at accelerated rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Over the past year, we’ve entered what we call the era of the ‘bionic hacker,’ which is human researchers using agentic AI systems to collect data, triage, and advance discovery,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/crystal-hazen-0x01/"&gt;Crystal Hazen&lt;/a&gt;, senior bug bounty program manager at HackerOne, which has added AI tools to its platform to help streamline submissions and triage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research by HackerOne found a 210% increase in valid AI-related vulnerability reports this year compared to 2024. It also saw a 339% jump in total bounties paid for AI vulnerabilities this year, as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/657751/top-bug-bounty-programs.html"&gt;bug bounty programs&lt;/a&gt; evolve to address vulnerabilities in AI-enabled applications, with prompt-injection flaws, model manipulation, and insecure plug-in design accounting for the majority of findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-slop-taxes-defenders"&gt;AI slop taxes defenders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry experts advise that AI should only be used as a ‘research assistant’ or guide rather than the principle mechanism of vulnerability discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/intidc/?originalSubdomain=be"&gt;Inti De Ceukelaire&lt;/a&gt;, chief hacker officer at bug bounty platform Intigriti, says AI has &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3632268/gen-ai-is-transforming-the-cyber-threat-landscape-by-democratizing-vulnerability-hunting.html"&gt;leveled the playing field for hackers&lt;/a&gt; because it can help less skilled researchers to identify potentially vulnerable systems or analyze code for flaws. But the results of AI-based analysis are not always reliable — and this has created practical problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seen AI acting as an echo chamber and amplifier for individuals that believe they might be onto something, luring them into a downwards spiral of confirmation bias,” De Ceukelaire tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams dealing with external vulnerability reports will need to be increasingly skeptical of inbound reports that show signs of relying heavily on AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bug bounty platforms offering triage services could help with this, as they are able to measure the track record of researchers over time, and use in-depth technologies to detect and recognize AI slop before it gets to the company,” De Ceukelaire says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other security experts agree that outcomes of applying AI tools to bug hunting have thus far been mixed, while arguing that problems can be mitigated by careful triage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI tools, when properly applied and validated, do provide high impact findings, but we’re also seeing programs being overwhelmed by huge numbers of reports, most of which are slop, to put it delicately,” says &lt;a href="https://www.procircular.com/people/bobby-kuzma/"&gt;Bobby Kuzma&lt;/a&gt;, director of offensive cyber operations at cybersecurity and compliance consulting firm ProCircular.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Triaging the increasing volume of variable-quality reports generated by some AI tools is putting a strain on under-resourced programs, including those associated with critical open-source software projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the curl project — a command-line tool commonly used for downloading files — has put out public entreaties to stop submitting AI-detected bugs. Maintainers of the project complained that they were spending &lt;a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/"&gt;too much time on low-quality bug reports generated using AI tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Project lead Daniel Stenberg compared the barrage of unsubstantiated and false reports to a denial-of-service attack. More recently, Stenberg softened his criticism following the submission of some genuine bug reports partly generated by AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="firehose-of-false-positives"&gt;Firehose of ‘false positives’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunterollmann/"&gt;Gunter Ollmann&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Cobalt.io, warns that AI is exacerbating the existing problem that comes from vendors getting swamped with often low-quality bug submissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security researchers turning to AI is creating a “firehose of noise, false positives, and duplicates,” according to Ollmann.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The future of security testing isn’t about managing a crowd of bug hunters finding duplicate and low-quality bugs; it’s about accessing on demand the best experts to find and fix exploitable vulnerabilities — as part of a continuous, programmatic, offensive security program,” Ollmann says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorhorwitz/"&gt;Trevor Horwitz&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at UK-based investment research platform TrustNet, adds: “The best results still come from people who know how to guide the tools. AI brings speed and scale, but human judgment is what turns output into impact.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/authors/gal-nagli"&gt;Gal Nagli&lt;/a&gt;, head of threat exposure at cloud security vendor Wiz and a bug bounty hunter, tells CSO that AI tools are yet to make a dramatic difference in bug bounty hunting, at least when it comes to more skilled practitioners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers who automate infrastructure-based vulnerabilities at scale — like default credentials or subdomain takeovers — already have reliable tooling and detections in place. “AI isn’t needed in those cases,” Nagli says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The real value of AI is in augmenting expert researchers, especially when testing authenticated portals or analyzing sprawling codebases and JavaScript files,” Nagli explains. “It helps uncover vulnerabilities that were previously too complex or subtle to detect without AI.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest generation of models can provide real assistance to skilled bug bounty hunters, not by replacing them, but by enhancing what they’re able to find.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fully autonomous agents still struggle, especially with authentication and scenarios where human context is critical,” Nagli adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-risk-management"&gt;Enterprise risk management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3619983/bug-bounty-programs-why-companies-need-them-now-more-than-ever.html"&gt;Bug bounty programs&lt;/a&gt; have matured into extensions of enterprise risk management strategies by constantly surfacing real threats before attackers exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders are moving toward continuous, data-driven exposure management, combining human intelligence with automation to maintain real-time visibility across assets, supply chains, and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HackerOne reports 83% of organizations surveyed now use bug bounties, and payouts grew 13% year-over-year, reaching $81 million across all programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As common vulnerability types like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection become easier to mitigate, organizations are shifting their focus and rewards toward findings that expose deeper systemic risk, including identity, access, and business logic flaws, according to HackerOne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HackerOne’s latest annual benchmark report shows that improper access control and insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities increased between 18% and 29% year over year, highlighting where both attackers and defenders are now concentrating their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The challenge for organizations in 2025 will be balancing speed, transparency, and trust: measuring crowdsourced offensive testing while maintaining responsible disclosure, fair payouts, and AI-augmented vulnerability report validation,” HackerOne’s Hazen concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
