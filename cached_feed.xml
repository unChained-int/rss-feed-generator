      <title>Startup Amutable plotting Linux security overhaul to counter hacking threats</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4125145/startup-amutable-plotting-linux-security-overhaul-to-counter-hacking-threats.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing guaranteed to grab attention in the computer security world, it’s announcing yourself without fully explaining what it is you plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, the Linux world got a taste of this enigmatic marketing ploy with the launch out of stealth of Berlin-based Linux security outfit Amutable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While its purpose is only vaguely defined in &lt;a href="https://amutable.com/blog/introducing-amutable" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the launch announcement&lt;/a&gt;, nobody could accuse it of lacking ambition: it plans to bring “determinism and verifiable integrity to Linux systems” to address the operating system’s security weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most tiny companies nobody has heard of would struggle to make the tactic work, but Amutable’s roster of founders is made up of several well-known Linux figures, headed by former Red Hat and Microsoft engineer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lennart Poettering&lt;/a&gt; as chief engineer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Best known as the developer of the contentious but widely used Linux UEFI boot manager &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"&gt;systemd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, he has alongside him two other ex-Microsoft employees, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherk1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Kühl&lt;/a&gt; as CEO, and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-brauner/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Brauner&lt;/a&gt; as CTO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A clue to Amutable’s plans lies in the announcement’s emphasis on some of its founders’ backgrounds in Kubernetes, &lt;em&gt;runc&lt;/em&gt;, LXC, Incus, and &lt;em&gt;containerd&lt;/em&gt;, all connected in different ways to the Linux container stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="verifiable-integrity"&gt;Verifiable integrity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Computing is full of security problems, and Linux is no exception to this rule, given convincing the protective free and open source software community of the wisdom of a radical new idea often turns out to be as big a challenge as the engineering itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Linux distros on desktop computers remain a niche, the technology’s invisible domination of online platforms and cloud container orchestration tools makes it the most important operating system in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That, not surprisingly, has made it a target for attacks, with cybercriminals taking advantage of vulnerabilities allowing privilege escalation, container escapes, and other exploits, as well as embedding backdoors in open source images across Linux’s complex supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judging from Amutable’s self-declared vision to bring “determinism and verifiable integrity to Linux system,” the founders see plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today’s infrastructure approaches security reactively. Software agents watch for vulnerabilities and intrusions; attackers refine their evasion. These defensive approaches are costly, brittle, and ineffective,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Amutable’s mission is to deliver verifiable integrity to Linux workloads everywhere. We look forward to working towards this goal with the broader Linux community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-cocktail-of-problems"&gt;A cocktail of problems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue presents a rich cocktail of problems, the underlying causes of which are the difficulty of verifying that an image is as its developers intended and hasn’t been tampered with, while also maintaining a verifiable system state. Even existing security tools are struggling to keep up, with a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3971170/proof-of-concept-bypass-shows-weakness-in-linux-security-tools-claims-israeli-vendor.html" target="_blank"&gt;2025 proof-of-concept&lt;/a&gt; showing that it was possible to bypass leading Linux runtime security tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps what Amutable’s founders mean when they describe the need to “replace heuristics with rigor” to achieve “verifiable integrity.” An image should be cryptographically verifiable in advance, including, ideally, a hash record of every stage of the boot process as well as running continuous checks against a signed file manifest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, instead of looking for a rogue file or suspicious behavior after the fact, the system would be able to verify itself deterministically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Introduction of this model of verifiability into Linux might have mitigated a range of incidents, including a 2023 attack where attackers &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4087323/runtime-bugs-break-container-walls-enabling-root-on-docker-hosts.html" target="_blank"&gt;exploited CVE-2022-42475&lt;/a&gt; in Fortinet’s FortiOS SSL-VPN function to implant malware. Or a more &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4087323/runtime-bugs-break-container-walls-enabling-root-on-docker-hosts.html" target="_blank"&gt;recent vulnerability (CVE-2025-31133)&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;runc&lt;/em&gt; Kubernetes container runtime that allowed attackers to break out of containers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the issue’s biggest impact was from the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2077692/dangerous-xz-utils-backdoor-was-the-result-of-years-long-supply-chain-compromise-effort.html" target="_blank"&gt;backdoor supply chain hack&lt;/a&gt; affecting the XZ Utils data compression library that was uncovered by chance in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-common-goal"&gt;A common goal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security of the IT infrastructure is one of the top concerns for decades, and immutability, verification and full coverage of software supply chain throughout the lifecycle of an operating system or complete infrastructure are important contributions to achieve this,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mge1512/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Matthias G. Eckermann&lt;/a&gt;, director of product management, Linux at SUSE. He pointed out that SUSE is already delivering on this in multiple ways, including its certified Software Supply Chain and its Immutable OS with Transactional Updates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are looking forward to hearing more from Amutable and collaborating with them on the common goal of improving resiliency and security of open-source infrastructure software,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technology-not-the-only-problem"&gt;Technology not the only problem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, where this goes and how Amutable will make money is up in the air, but it will attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security teams are trained to trust signed packages and verified sources. When the supply chain itself is compromised (like the XZ Utils backdoor in 2024), traditional security training doesn’t prepare defenders for that scenario,” commented &lt;a href="https://trainingcamp.com/author-cporter/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Porter&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of certification company Training Camp. “If they [Amutable] can simplify verification, it reduces the expertise burden on security teams who currently lack deep Linux platform knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, technology isn’t the only problem. “As Linux dominates cloud infrastructure, enterprises need security professionals who understand boot integrity, code signing, and verification, skills that aren’t covered in most certification programs,” said Porter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Large migrant smuggling operation in Bulgaria leads to 16 arrests</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/large-migrant-smuggling-operation-in-bulgaria-leads-to-16-arrests</link>
      <description>A Bulgarian-led investigation, carried out in close cooperation with the Hellenic Police and supported by Europol, has led to the dismantlement of an organised criminal network involved in smuggling of migrants from Türkiye via Bulgaria and onward through Serbia or Romania towards Western European countries. The investigation was conducted within the framework of a regional Operational Taskforce established to target migrant smuggling networks using Bulgaria as a transit country.</description>

      <title>Law enforcement challenges major cocaine supply chains into Europe</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-challenges-major-cocaine-supply-chains-europe</link>
      <description>Law enforcement authorities across Europe and South America continue to put sustained pressure on the criminal networks responsible for moving cocaine into Europe. Three recent actions coordinated by Europol, one targeting a Dutch-led network embedded in Colombian supply chains, another dismantling a Brazilian maritime trafficking operation and a third disrupting a Greek at-sea transfer criminal operation, highlight the ongoing efforts to disrupt the routes and structures used by organised crime.</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quantum Screen 16z9" class="wp-image-4122048" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gorodenkoff_shutterstock_2615909831_16z9.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wenn Quantum Computing und KI in der Praxis zusammenkommen, bricht ein neues Zeitalter an – auch und vor allem in Sachen Cybersecurity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Gorodenkoff | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In den letzten Jahren hat künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ihre Tentakel über die globale Technologielandschaft &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030328/so-verandert-ki-ihre-grc-strategie.html" target="_blank"&gt;ausgebreitet&lt;/a&gt;. Das verdeutlicht unter anderem auch der zunehmende Einsatz von Automatisierung und autonomen Technologien in diversen Branchen und Sektoren. Und während die Welt noch mit dem Impact der KI ringt, steht mit Quantencomputing bereits das “next big thing” in den Startlöchern. Das Aufeinandertreffen dieser beiden Technologien verspricht, der nächste große technologische Schauplatz zu werden. Dieser könnte nicht nur Computing und Cybersicherheit, sondern sogar geopolitische Machtstrukturen entscheidend prägen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denn während KI-Algorithmen dafür bekannt sind, Muster zu erkennen und aus den ihnen zugeführten Daten zu lernen, versprechen &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4121972/davos-abwarten-ist-beim-quanten-computing-keine-option.html" target="_blank"&gt;Quantencomputer&lt;/a&gt;, mehrere Wege gleichzeitig zu erkunden. Das legt nahe, dass mit der Technologie eine Revolution in Sachen Datenverarbeitung bevorsteht. Anstelle von Bits (0en und 1en), wie sie von KI-Systemen verwendet werden, nutzen Quantencomputer Qubits, die dank der Prinzipien der Superposition und Verschränkung gleichzeitig in mehreren Zuständen existieren können. So verspricht ein gut konzipiertes Quantensystem, Probleme in Mikrosekunden zu lösen, für die konventionelle Computer Jahre benötigen würden. Das könnte beispielsweise dazu beitragen, künftig manipulationssichere Kommunikationsinfrastrukturen zu etablieren – Stichwort Quantum Key Distribution (&lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/quantum-networking-technologies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QKD&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-trifft-quantum-computing-ein-zweischneidiges-schwert"&gt;KI trifft Quantum Computing – ein zweischneidiges Schwert&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Je mehr Daten in einen KI-Algorithmus einfließen, desto besser sind im Regelfall die Ergebnisse. Besonders großangelegte KI-Systeme wie ChatGPT oder DeepMind AlphaFold haben jedoch regelmäßig mit den Grenzen zu kämpfen, die ihre zugrundeliegende Hardware aufwirft. Mit Quantencomputern würden sich diese Limitationen in Luft auflösen: Sie nutzen Quantum Machine Learning (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01146" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QML&lt;/a&gt;), um etwa Muster zu erkennen oder Simulationen zu optimieren. Darüber hinaus macht das Konzept des QML-Trainings es sehr wahrscheinlich auch überflüssig, Echtzeit-Trainingsdaten über riesige Rechenzentren bereitzustellen. In der Praxis wird die Kapazität von Quantencomputern Ergebnisse in Mikrosekunden liefern. Das macht etwa globale Echtzeit-Klimasysteme und Real-Time-Finanzmarktsimulationen möglich.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doch die schöne neue Quanten-Zukunft hat auch eine dunkle Seite: Schließlich kann die Technologie auch von Cyberkriminellen als Waffe instrumentalisiert werden. Mit den resultierenden, quantengestützten Cyberbedrohungen könnten aktuelle &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2650080/faq-was-sie-ueber-verschluesselung-wissen-sollten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Verschlüsselungsverfahren&lt;/a&gt; wie ECC, RSA oder AES ausgehebelt werden – wobei die beiden erstgenannten etwa von Finanzinstituten genutzt werden, um Online-Transaktionen abzusichern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Würden diese Encryption-Methoden kompromittiert, wäre die Vertraulichkeit verschlüsselter Daten passé. Der Tag, an dem es dazu kommt, bezeichnet man auch als „&lt;a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/07/01/pqc-standardization/"&gt;Q-Day&lt;/a&gt;“. Und es lauern noch weitere, quantengestützte Gefahren. So könnten Cyberkriminelle die Technologie etwa auch einsetzen, um:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passwörter zu knacken,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;digitale Zertifikate zu fälschen, oder&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Deepfakes von KI-Systemen zu erstellen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="der-weg-in-die-quanten-zukunft"&gt;Der Weg in die Quanten-Zukunft&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sowohl Unternehmen als auch Regierungsinstitutionen, bereiten sich bereits auf den Q-Day vor. Das britische National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) verfolgt etwa einen stufenweisen Ansatz, um bis zum Jahr 2035 sämtliche seiner Systeme entsprechend zu härten. In den USA soll die Umstellung der nationalen Sicherheitssysteme ähnlich laufen – hier ist 2030 das Ziel. Diese Bemühungen sind ein proaktiver Verteidigungsansatz, der darauf fokussiert, &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;quantenresistente Verschlüsselungsmodelle&lt;/a&gt; und adaptive Cybersicherheitsrichtlinien zu entwickeln, die die Sicherheit kryptografischer Schlüssel im nahenden Quantenzeitalter gewährleisten können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weil auch Quanten-Systeme auf Wahrscheinlichkeiten basieren und nicht auf Gewissheiten, besteht die Herausforderung für diejenigen, die diese Innovationen entwickeln, nicht nur darin, die schnellsten und effizientesten Kombinationsmöglichkeiten von KI- und Quantensystemen aufzutun. Es geht dabei auch und insbesondere um das Thema Trust. Dieses Vertrauen müsste in Form von Cybersecurity Frameworks und -Regulierungen aufgebaut werden, die die Sicherheit, Transparenz und Governance optimieren. Das kann auch dazu beitragen, die Themenfelder Post-Quanten-Kryptografie, KI-Audits, Observability und Ethik anzugehen, die die Grundlage für widerstandsfähige digitale Ökosysteme bilden werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch wenn KI und Quantencomputing die menschliche Intelligenz nicht ersetzen werden, werden ihre Spuren in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft überall zu sehen sein. Die eigentliche Frage ist dabei jedoch, ob sich unsere Gesellschaft an das Tempo dieser technologischen Entwicklungen anpassen kann – bevor sie von ihr beherrscht wird. Trotz aller positiven Aussichten ist die Gefahr groß, dass die Kombination aus Quantum Computing und KI die Grundlagen des digitalen Vertrauens und der Privatsphäre, auf denen moderne Gesellschaften beruhen, untergraben. Und angesichts des immer näher rückenden Q-Day steigt auch die Dringlichkeit, sich auf die Post-Quanten-Welt vorzubereiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für Unternehmen, Regierungen und Cybersicherheitsexperten heißt das in erster Linie, über die Innovation und den technologischen Fortschritt, den die Technologien mit sich bringen, hinauszublicken und die Resilienz in den Fokus zu nehmen. Das wird massive Investitionen erfordern, um ethische KI-Governance, Regulierungsrahmen und Vorschriften sowie Post-Quanten-Kryptografie-Standards in bestehenden Systemen zu fördern.
