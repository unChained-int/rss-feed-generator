      <title>Spanish e-retailer PcComponentes denies report it was hacked</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4120572/a-hacker-using-the-alias-daghetiaw-claims-to-have-breached-the-security-of-pccomponentes.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spanish online electronics retailer PcComponentes has denied a hacker’s claims to have stolen data on its customers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hackrisk.io, a strategic cyber threat intelligence platform developed and maintained by Hackmanac, reported that a malicious actor using the alias ‘daghetiaw’ claimed to have hacked the e-commerce company, adding that it was attempting to verify the claim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Hackrisk.io, the hacker allegedly stole data relating to 16.3 million people, including tax identification numbers, orders, invoices, addresses, contact details, Zendesk tickets, credit card metadata, IP addresses, and purchase information. The platform notes that the hacker has shared a sample of 500,000 lines as proof of the data theft from PcComponentes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSO contacted PCComponentes, which issued a &lt;a href="https://www.pccomponentes.com/actualizacion-importante-oficial-seguridad-datos" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; explaining that there had been no unauthorized access to its databases or internal systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we have detected is a phenomenon known in cybersecurity as credential stuffing. This means that a third party has used email addresses and passwords obtained from security breaches in compromised databases outside of PcComponentes,” the statement said, adding, “The categories of data affected are: name, surname, ID number (in cases where the customer has entered it), address, IP, email, and telephone number.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PcComponentes said, “The figure of 16 million customers allegedly affected is false, as the number of active accounts on PcComponentes is significantly lower. Furthermore, the illegitimate access has not been widespread, meaning that only some customers have been affected.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also explained that bank details have not been compromised in any case, “since PcComponentes does not store them, but only keeps a security code (&lt;em&gt;token&lt;/em&gt;) that is used to identify the payment, but does not allow the card to be viewed or charges to be made on its own. This code has no value outside the payment system and cannot be used fraudulently. For this reason, there is no risk of bank details being stolen”; nor are customer passwords, as “they are never stored in our database. Instead, they are converted into a secret, encrypted code (&lt;em&gt;hash&lt;/em&gt;). This code is irreversible, which means that neither we nor anyone else can see the original password.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, PcComponentes reports that it has implemented a series of measures aimed at minimizing the impact of this incident, which “significantly strengthen account protection and reduce the risk of illegitimate access from compromised databases outside PcComponentes that are published on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.es/article/4119855/un-hacker-que-utiliza-el-alias-daghetiaw-afirma-haber-violado-la-seguridad-de-pccomponentes.html"&gt;Computerworld/CSO España&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lesen Sie, worauf es bei der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Ihrem IT-Security- und Engineering-Team ankommt." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3357587/1200x.jpg" title="Lesen Sie, worauf es bei der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Ihrem IT-Security- und Engineering-Team ankommt." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Lesen Sie, worauf es bei der Zusammenarbeit zwischen Ihrem IT-Security- und Engineering-Team ankommt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: Lipik Stock Media – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security-Teams bestehen in erster Linie aus Mitarbeitern, die für den Betrieb und die Einhaltung von Vorschriften und Richtlinien zuständig sind. IT-Sicherheitstechnik-Teams, neudeutsch Security-Engineering-Teams, hingegen sind Konstrukteure. Sie entwickeln Dienste, automatisieren Prozesse und optimieren Bereitstellungen, um das zentrale IT-Sicherheitsteam und seine Stakeholder zu unterstützen. Das Security-Engineering-Team bestehen in der Regel aus Software- und Infrastrukturingenieuren, Architekten und Produktmanagern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="technische-fhigkeiten-im-bereich-it-sicherheitstechnik"&gt;Technische Fähigkeiten im Bereich IT-Sicherheitstechnik&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security Engineering ist im Wesentlichen eine technische Disziplin, so dass eines der grundlegenden Elemente dieser Rolle natürlich in der Technologie verwurzelt ist. Dies sind die wesentlichen Fähigkeiten, die CISOs in ihren Security-Engineering-Teams vermitteln und entwickeln sollten:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="verstehen-des-technischen-umfelds"&gt;Verstehen des technischen Umfelds&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dass es von entscheidender Bedeutung ist, die technische Umgebung zu verstehen und in ihr zu arbeiten, scheint eine Selbstverständlichkeit zu sein. Doch wenn ein Unternehmen beispielsweise Dienste in Kubernetes bereitstellt und das Technikteam noch nie mit Containern gearbeitet hat, ist das ein Problem. Ein hohes Maß an technischem Verständnis der gesamten IT-Umgebung wirkt sich positiv auf das Security-Team aus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Kontrapunkt dazu ist die Förderung eines vielfältigen Teams in Bezug auf die Fähigkeiten, Problemlösungsperspektiven und Erfahrungsstufen in den verschiedenen Bereichen eines Unternehmens. Es gibt natürlich viele Möglichkeiten, diese Vielfalt in einem Team anzustreben und zu fördern, vom Geschlecht und der ethnischen Zugehörigkeit über den Bildungshintergrund bis hin zu früheren Berufserfahrungen und dem Alter. Diversität kann die kreative Energie eines Teams stark erhöhen, wenn Ideen in Frage gestellt, debattiert und wiederholt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Allerdings sollten Führungskräfte mit der Vielfalt an Perspektiven und Erfahrungen sorgfältig umgehen. Ein übermäßiges Maß an Variation und Reibung im Denk- und Kooperationsprozess kann zum Gegenteil der gewünschten Wirkung führen. Häufig kommt es zu einer Analyse-Paralyse, bei der die Teams in einem Zustand des Nachdenkens über das Tun statt des Tuns stecken bleiben. Ein ähnlicher Zustand, der sich aus übermäßig unterschiedlichen Teams ergeben kann, ist eine komplexe Reihe von voneinander abhängigen Ergebnissen, die miteinander verbundene Fehlerbedingungen aufweisen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="den-gesamten-stack-beherrschen"&gt;Den gesamten Stack beherrschen&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT-Sicherheitstechnikteams sollten in der Lage sein, die von ihnen entwickelten Dienste zu erstellen und zu betreiben. Dieses Maß an Eigenverantwortung innerhalb einer Gruppe ist aus Sicht der technischen Kompetenz und aus kultureller Sicht von entscheidender Bedeutung, da es den Ton in Bezug auf die Verantwortlichkeit angibt. Technisch gesehen wird ein Team, das in der Lage ist, seine Dienste selbst zu verwalten, die Infrastruktur, die CI/CD-Tools, die Security-Tools, den Anwendungscode, die Deployments und die von einem Dienst ausgehenden operativen Telemetriedaten kompetent verwalten. Darüber hinaus sind die Fähigkeiten, die hinter der Unterstützung durch ein Team stehen, in hohem Maße übertragbar, um andere Gruppen im Unternehmen zu unterstützen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="das-entwicklererlebnis-miteinbeziehen-devx"&gt;Das Entwicklererlebnis miteinbeziehen (DevX)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security-Teams, die das Entwickler-Tool DevX verstehen, annehmen und optimieren, werden wahrscheinlich besser zusammenarbeiten. Darüber hinaus wird ein besonderer Schwerpunkt auf der Beseitigung von Reibungsverlusten liegen. Reibung führt dazu, dass Dinge länger dauern und mehr kosten, dass sich Lernzyklen verlängern und dass Frustration auftritt. Weniger Reibung wird dazu führen, dass die Dinge im Allgemeinen viel besser ablaufen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manchmal sind Reibungen aber auch notwendig und sollten gewollt sein. Ein Beispiel ist eine erzwungene Codeüberprüfung von kritischem Code, bevor er zusammengeführt wird. Wenn diese Unterbrechung, Überprüfung und Zusammenführung auf einer bewussten Entscheidung beruht, ist das eine gerechtfertigte, bewusste Reibung. Wenn das IT-Sicherheitsteam Reibungsverluste im Freigabeprozess von Entwicklern anstrebt, sollten diese auf spezifischen Anforderungen beruhen, zum Beispiel auf einer Compliance-Kontrolle, die eine manuelle Überprüfung als Teil des Change Managements vorschreibt. Diese Kontrollen sollten nicht unüberlegt eingesetzt werden. Die Reibungsverluste, die den Entwicklern entstehen, stellen Nachteile dar, die jedes vom IT-Sicherheitsteam in Betracht gezogene, nicht definierte Risiko aufwiegen könnten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT-Sicherheitsteams, die die Erfahrung der Entwickler als oberste Priorität betrachten, müssen die Werkzeuge und Abläufe verstehen, die für das Schreiben von Qualitätssoftware auf verschiedenen Ebenen des Stacks erforderlich sind. Die Übernahme dieser Denkweise, bei der der Entwickler im Vordergrund steht, erfordert möglicherweise Kenntnisse im Bereich Infrastruktur oder Plattform-Engineering. Andererseits kann sich der Output eines IT-Sicherheitstechnik-Teams auf andere auswirken, die ebenfalls mit der Automatisierung von Arbeitsabläufen, der Verbindung von Diensten untereinander und im Wesentlichen mit der gemeinsamen Instrumentierung einer immer größer werdenden Umgebung beschäftigt sind. All diese Arbeiten helfen den Entwicklern, schneller und mit weniger Reibungsverlusten zu arbeiten. Resultat sind mehr Flexibilität und ein schnelleres Deployment. Unabhängig davon ist dies eine Eigenschaft und ein Leitfaden, von dem ein Security-Engineering-Tem in seiner Produktivität profitiert und das Einfühlungsvermögen derer, denen es dient, fördert und kultiviert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fhigkeiten-zur-fhrung-und-zusammenarbeit-in-der-sicherheitstechnik"&gt;Fähigkeiten zur Führung und Zusammenarbeit in der Sicherheitstechnik&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security-Entwickler-Teams arbeiten nicht im luftleeren Raum, unabhängig von ihrem Umfang und ihrer Projektauslastung. Die Arbeit an der Seite und im Dienste anderer ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des Auftrags. Sie ist ein notwendiger Teil des Ganzen und hilft anderen, erfolgreiche Ergebnisse zu erzielen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kommunizieren-und-zusammenarbeiten"&gt;Kommunizieren und zusammenarbeiten&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Mitglieder des Security-Engineering-Teams sollten in der Lage sein, miteinander und mit den Beteiligten außerhalb der Gruppe zu kommunizieren. Darüber hinaus sollten sie die Fähigkeit besitzen, gut zusammenzuarbeiten, um die gemeinsamen Ziele zu erreichen. Verstehen der Probleme, der Reibungspunkte, der Beschränkungen und der Möglichkeiten der IT-sicherheitsorientierten Entwicklung. Letztendlich ist es wichtiger, die richtigen Dinge zu tun, als einfach nur effizient zu arbeiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All diese Fragen müssen durch gezielte Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit erforscht werden. Dies kann sich in menschenzentrierten Gestaltungsprinzipien, matrixbasierten Ressourcen oder einer auf Teamtopologien basierenden Ausrichtung manifestieren. Natürlich gibt es kein Patentrezept für die Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit in und zwischen Teams. Unabhängig von der Herangehensweise sind Vertrauensbildung, Einfühlungsvermögen, Interesse an gemeinsamen Zielen und die Bereitschaft, den eigenen Stolz zugunsten der Mission zurückzustellen, die Grundlage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fhren-und-andere-beeinflussen"&gt;Führen und andere beeinflussen&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin, Bestsellerautor und Marketingexperte, vertritt die Ansicht, dass jeder eine Führungspersönlichkeit sein kann – es ist eine Entscheidung, kein Titel. Es geht um das Zusammentreffen von Ideen, eine Lücke in der Richtung und jemanden, der motiviert genug ist, sich zu engagieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Erfolg von Security-Engineering-Teams ist, wie bei anderen Cybersecurity-Bereichen auch, von anderen abhängig. Er ist jedoch unabhängig von der Leistung des Teams, so optimal diese auch sein mag. Anders ausgedrückt: Man kann nicht einfach etwas bauen und dann gehen. Sie müssen anderen zuhören, sie einbeziehen, sie zur Übernahme bewegen und vieles mehr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All das erfordert Führung. Genauer gesagt, Führung ohne Autorität. Die Mitglieder eines leistungsstarken Teams sollten in der Lage sein, das IT-Sicherheitstechnikteam selbst zu leiten und außerhalb der Gruppe Einfluss aufzubauen und zu nutzen. Das kann mit anderen Beteiligten oder mit internen Kunden eines Dienstes geschehen. Führen ohne Autorität bringt das Team dem Erfolg näher. Starke Beziehungen, organisatorisches Wissen und Kontext sowie technisches Fachwissen sollte zusammengebracht werden, um andere zu beeinflussen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="soft-skills-fr-sicherheitsingenieure"&gt;Soft Skills für Sicherheitsingenieure&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Fähigkeiten eines Security Engineers und des gesamten Teams sollten über Kommunikation und Zusammenarbeit hinausgehen. In diesem Zusammenhang bezieht sich der Begriff “Soft Skills” auf die zahlreichen nichttechnischen Fähigkeiten, die eher nach innen gerichtet sind und die technischen Fähigkeiten ergänzen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="zeit-und-priorittenmanagement"&gt;Zeit- und Prioritätenmanagement&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security-Entwickler werden immer viel zu tun haben. Die technischen Fähigkeiten führen dazu, dass häufig Anfragen zum Erstellen, Härten, Patchen oder allgemein zum Einmischen in die Software einer Umgebung eingehen werden. Zeit ist eine universelle Einschränkung für alle Teams. Aus diesem Grund müssen sowohl Einzelpersonen als auch Teams effektiver darin werden, Prioritäten zu setzen. Effizient zu sein, aber die falschen Dinge zu tun, bringt keinen Fortschritt. Es gibt viele Techniken, um Arbeit zu priorisieren, Wert gegen Komplexität abzuwägen und sich auf die Kundenzufriedenheit zu konzentrieren oder verschiedene Faktoren zu gewichten. Kunden- und Compliance-Anforderungen sind oft die treibende Kraft hinter den Prioritäten des Teams. Die Art der Prioritätensetzung ist weniger wichtig als die rücksichtslose Einhaltung der Prioritäten und der Schutz vor dem endlosen Ansturm von Anfragen, die mehr wertvolle Zeit in Anspruch nehmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="anpassungsfhigkeit"&gt;Anpassungsfähigkeit&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security-Engineering-Teams sollten in der Lage sein, sich an veränderte Anforderungen, Technologien und Umstände anzupassen. Anpassungsfähigkeit bedeutet mehr als die Priorisierung einer Aufgabe gegenüber einer anderen: Entscheiden ist die Anpassung der Herangehensweise an ein Problem auf der Grundlage der Bedürfnisse der Beteiligten. IT-Sicherheitstechnikteams müssen sich an die Eigenverantwortung auf der Grundlage des Teamwachstums und der sich ändernden Bedürfnisse der Interessengruppen sowie an die bewusste Einbeziehung einer vielfältigen Gruppe von Stimmen in den Problemlösungsprozess anpassen. Der Nutzen für die Beteiligten und die gesamte IT-Sicherheitsorganisation liegt dabei in der Agilität und Flexibilität. Ein agiles Team ist ein widerstandsfähigeres Team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kontinuierliches-lernen"&gt;Kontinuierliches Lernen&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Team, das in der Lage ist, ständig neue Fähigkeiten, organisatorische Zusammenhänge, Richtlinien und Arbeitsweisen zu erlernen, ist in der heutigen schnelllebigen Welt unbedingt notwendig. So sollten sich Mitglieder des Security Engineering-Teams ständig weiterentwickeln, sich selbst erneuern und auf bestehenden mentalen Modellen und Erfahrungen aufbauen. Dieses Konstrukt mentaler Modelle ermöglicht es Menschen, in Situationen einzutreten, die ähnliche Eigenschaften aufweisen wie etwas, an dem sie zuvor gearbeitet haben, und damit zu beginnen, etwas beizutragen, zu erforschen und zu tun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kontinuierliches Lernen kann sich auch auf die Kultur in einer Organisation auswirken. Wissen führt zum Austausch, Austausch führt zu Diskussionen und die Diskussion über neue Dinge weckt Interesse und Gespräche. Diese kollektive Entwicklung der mentalen Modelle, die das Unternehmen durchdringen, und der Art und Weise, wie Teams mit IT-Sicherheit umgehen und sich darauf beziehen, bringt die Kultur der Zusammenarbeit voran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Arbeit in diesem hoch spezialisierten Bereich bedeutet nicht, dass sich ein leistungsstarkes Team nur auf die Technologie konzentrieren kann. Menschen, die Erforschung von Problemen, der Aufbau von Beziehungen und die Festlegung von Prioritäten sind allesamt wesentliche Bestandteile eines leistungsstarken Sicherheitstechnikteams. Achten Sie beim Aufbau Ihres Teams darauf, diese Elemente zu investieren und zu pflegen. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was wäre, wenn das größte Sicherheitsrisiko Ihrer Organisation bereits einen Mitarbeitendenausweis besitzt, legitim angemeldet ist und genau weiß, wie interne Prozesse funktionieren? Diese Frage ist unbequem, aber sie markiert den Ausgangspunkt für eine längst überfällige Auseinandersetzung mit Insider-Bedrohungen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Insider Threats – der blinde Fleck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ob auf Fachkonferenzen oder in unternehmensinternen Meetings: Wenn über Sicherheitsrisiken gesprochen wird, richtet sich der Blick fast immer reflexartig nach außen. Auf Hackergruppen und Cyberkriminelle, auf ausländische Nachrichtendienste, auf Anhänger politischer oder religiöser Gruppen und auf wirtschaftliche Konkurrenten. Die eigenen Beschäftigten kommen als Tätergruppe in der Betrachtung kaum vor. Innentäter sind in vielen Organisationen immer noch ein Tabu-Thema, gelten allenfalls als Randphänomen und einzelne „schwarze Schafe“. Diese Annahme ist bequem – und gleichzeitig hoch gefährlich. Denn sie verstellt den Blick auf ein Risiko, das strukturell, vielschichtig und hoch wirksam ist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dass &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493598/datenklau-durch-mitarbeiter-wer-ist-ihre-groste-insider-bedrohung.html" target="_blank"&gt;Insider-Bedrohungen&lt;/a&gt; ein systematisches Sicherheitsrisiko sind, belegen empirische Daten. In einer &lt;a href="https://www.bitkom.org/sites/main/files/2025-12/bitkom-studienbericht-wirtschaftsschutz-2025_2.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bitkom-Umfrage aus dem Jahr 2025&lt;/a&gt; berichteten 48 Prozent der deutschen Unternehmen, dass Fälle von Datendiebstahl, Industriespionage oder Sabotage auf eigene Mitarbeitende zurückzuführen waren. Bei 25 Prozent der Unternehmen waren es unabsichtlich handelnde (ehemalige) Beschäftigte, bei 23 Prozent vorsätzlich handelnde (ehemalige) Beschäftigte. Nach Angriffen von organisierten Kriminellen und Banden (68 Prozent) sind Insider-Vergehen damit die zweithäufigsten Delikte. &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-insider-threats/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Andere Statistiken&lt;/a&gt; zeigen, dass bereits 61 Prozent der Organisationen weltweit einen Insider-Vorfall identifiziert haben und dies bei 29 Prozent zu einem Sicherheitsvorfall führte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Zahlen machen deutlich: Eine Sicherheitsstrategie, die den Fokus ausschließlich auf externe Bedrohungen legt, ist gefährlich lückenhaft. Insider-Risiken sind ein relevanter Teil der Bedrohungslandschaft und müssen in Risikoanalysen systematisch mitgedacht werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="insider-gefahren-werden-unterschatzt"&gt;Insider-Gefahren werden unterschätzt&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die soziale Organisation ist ein grundlegendes Merkmal der menschlichen Evolution. Seit jeher haben sich Menschen zu Gruppen zusammengeschlossen, um gemeinsam zu jagen, Wissen zu teilen und sich gegen Bedrohungen zu verteidigen. Teil einer Gruppe zu sein, bedeutete Schutz vor Gefahren von außen und konnte das Überleben sichern. Basis für all das war gegenseitiges Vertrauen innerhalb der Gruppe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch heute bildet Vertrauen die Grundlage für das Funktionieren einer Organisation. Es ist Ausgangspunkt für eine konstruktive, effiziente und erfolgreiche Zusammenarbeit. Um ihre Arbeitsaufgaben zu erfüllen, benötigen Mitarbeitende Zutritt zum Firmengelände, Zugang zu Datenbanken und Bestellsystemen sowie Zugriff auf Informationen über Produkte, Prozesse, Lieferanten, Dienstleister und Kunden. Arbeitgeber statten Beschäftigte dazu mit den notwendigen Berechtigungen aus und vertrauen im Gegenzug auf die Loyalität und Integrität ihrer Mitarbeitenden. Das sich jemand von innen bewusst und vorsätzlich gegen die eigene Organisation wenden könnte, ist für viele Menschen dabei nicht vorstellbar und moralisch schlichtweg verwerflich. Die Folge: Die Gefahr wird ausgeblendet. Blindes Vertrauen macht Organisationen jedoch verwundbar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="insider-bedrohungen-sind-gefahrlich"&gt;Insider-Bedrohungen sind gefährlich&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insider verfügen über legitime Berechtigungen und haben ein tiefes Wissen über Infrastruktur, Systeme, Prozesse und Stakeholder. Gleichzeitig haben sie auch die Schwachstellen einer Organisation sehr genau im Blick. Sie kennen kritische Assets, wissen, wo sensible Daten liegen oder welche Prozesse besonders verwundbar sind. Insider wissen zudem, welche Kontrollmechanismen existieren und welche nicht. Auch kennen sie sich damit aus, wie sie Sicherheitslücken ausnutzen und Kontrollen umgehen können. Das ist ein struktureller Vorteil aller Insider.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doch erst die missbräuchliche Verwendung von Berechtigungen macht einen Insider zum Innentäter. Diese zu erkennen ist allerdings schwierig, weil ihre Handlungen unauffällig und legitim wirken. Zugriffe erfolgen mit gültigen Berechtigungen, Prozesse werden formal eingehalten, Auffälligkeiten sind subtil. Klassische Sicherheitsmechanismen schlagen hier oft nicht an.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So können Innentäter oftmals über einen längeren Zeitraum agieren, ohne entdeckt zu werden. Typische vorsätzliche Angriffsformen von innen sind Betrug, Diebstahl von Informationen und physischen Gütern, Spionage, Sabotage sowie Gewalt. Die Auslöser für diese Taten sind vielfältig und reichen von emotionalen und situativen Belastungen, Unzufriedenheit und Frust, Opportunismus, finanziellen Interessen bis hin zu Loyalitätskonflikten. Neben solchen illoyalen Insidern gibt es zudem professionell eingeschleuste Innentäter, die beispielsweise im Auftrag eines ausländischen Nachrichtendienstes agieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz zu diesen beiden Tätergruppen gibt es eine dritte Personengruppe: Das sind Beschäftigte, die zum Beispiel in der Hektik des Alltags auf einen Link in einer Phishing-E-Mail klicken, aus Nachlässigkeit eine E-Mail an einen falschen Adressaten senden oder von der Firma nicht zugelassene &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3854432/mit-genai-zum-insider-threat.html" target="_blank"&gt;KI-Tools verwenden&lt;/a&gt;, um Arbeitszeit zu sparen. Ob man bei dieser letzten Gruppe, die ohne böswillige Absicht und kriminelle Energie handelt, von Innentätern sprechen und diese so behandeln kann und will, muss jede Organisation für sich selbst definieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Schadensausmaß bei Angriffen von innen kann massiv sein. Schäden durch Innentäter wirken häufig nachhaltiger als externe Angriffe, sowohl finanziell, reputativ als auch organisatorisch. Je nach Schwere des Angriffs kann zudem ein organisationales Trauma entstehen, zum Beispiel nach einem Amoklauf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="klassische-sicherheitsmasnahmen-reichen-nicht-aus"&gt;Klassische Sicherheitsmaßnahmen reichen nicht aus&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technische Systeme leisten einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Erkennung von Insider-Risiken, stoßen dabei jedoch an klare Grenzen. Tools wie Identity and Access Management (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495114/identity-access-managementdie-9-besten-iam-tools.html" target="_blank"&gt;IAM&lt;/a&gt;), Data Loss Prevention (DLP) oder User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) können Auffälligkeiten und Abweichungen identifizieren, nicht jedoch die dahinterliegenden Emotionen, Motive oder Intentionen. Technik kann damit Hinweise liefern und Symptome sichtbar machen, doch ein erheblicher Teil von Insider-Bedrohungen bleibt für technische Systeme unsichtbar. Denken Sie an den Diebstahl von Papierakten, die Installation von Mini-Kameras zur Überwachung von Computerbildschirmen oder die Sabotage von physischer Infrastruktur. Insider-Bedrohungen sind komplex und keinesfalls ein reines IT-Thema. Auch andere Abteilungen wie die Unternehmenssicherheit, HR, Compliance, Legal, interne Kommunikation und das Management sind relevante Stakeholder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein weiteres zentrales Problem ist die fehlende klare Risk Ownership für Insider Threats. Während der Schutz vor externen Angriffen in vielen Organisationen fest verankert ist – oft mit eigenen Abteilungen, klar definierten Verantwortlichkeiten und etablierten Prozessen – fehlt ein vergleichbares Pendant für Bedrohungen aus dem Inneren häufig vollständig. Ohne eindeutige Zuständigkeit lassen sich Insider-Risiken weder systematisch bewerten noch präventiv steuern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Folge von Technikfixierung, Silodenken und fehlender Zuständigkeit: Punktuelle Einzelmaßnahmen wie strengere Zugriffsrechte, zusätzliche Kontrollen und neue Tools. Diese Maßnahmen sind nicht falsch, aber sie bilden nur ein isoliertes Fragment eines systematischen Risikomanagements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-ein-moderner-umgang-mit-insider-threats-bedeutet"&gt;Was ein moderner Umgang mit Insider Threats bedeutet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Unsicherheit im Umgang mit Insider-Bedrohungen zeigt sich auch in &lt;a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/2024-insider-threat-report-trends-challenges-and-solutions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Umfragen&lt;/a&gt;: Während es unter Cybersecurity-Experten einen deutlichen Anstieg der Besorgnis über böswillige Insider, von 60 Prozent im Jahr 2019 auf 74 Prozent im Jahr 2024, gibt, haben nur 29 Prozent der Befragten das Gefühl, über die richtigen Werkzeuge zum Schutz ihrer Organisation zu verfügen. Was oftmals fehlt, ist eine übergreifende Perspektive: Welche Risiken sind für uns wirklich kritisch? Wie fügt sich das Thema in bestehende Risiko-, Governance- und Prozessstrukturen ein? Wer trägt Verantwortung?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein zeitgemäßer Umgang mit Insider-Bedrohungen beginnt nicht mit Misstrauen, sondern mit Risikobewusstsein. Es geht nicht darum, Mitarbeitende unter Generalverdacht zu stellen, sondern Risiken systematisch zu verstehen und verantwortungsvoll zu steuern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zentral ist der Perspektivwechsel: von Reaktion zu Prävention, von Einzelfällen zu Strukturen, von Technik zu Organisation. Ein moderner Ansatz verbindet Kultur, Struktur und Verantwortung. Er stärkt Vertrauen und Compliance, indem klare Regeln und Prozesse etabliert werden. Außerdem ermöglicht er nachhaltige Resilienz, statt nur auf Vorfälle zu reagieren. Der Appell ist eindeutig: Wegsehen erhöht das Risiko. Hinschauen schafft Handlungsfähigkeit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fazit-warum-jetzt-gehandelt-werden-muss"&gt;Fazit: Warum jetzt gehandelt werden muss&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innentätermanagement ist kein Produkt und kein Kontrollregime. Es ist ein menschenzentrierter Managementansatz, der Vertrauen schützt, indem er Risiken transparent macht und bewusst adressiert. Mit den europäischen Richtlinien &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4103179/nis2-umsetzen-ohne-im-papierkrieg-zu-enden.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS2 &lt;/a&gt;und CER rückt das Risikomanagement stärker in den Fokus. Noch immer wird Sicherheit häufig als eine Art Außenverteidigung verstanden. Was dabei oft übersehen wird: Ein erheblicher Teil der Risiken entsteht innerhalb von Organisationen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innentätermanagement ist damit keine optionale Ergänzung mehr, sondern Teil verantwortungsvoller Unternehmenssteuerung. Die entscheidende Frage lautet nicht, ob Insider-Risiken existieren, sondern ob Organisationen bereit sind, sie bewusst zu managen. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>The cybercrime industry continues to challenge CISOs in 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4119555/cybercrime-inc-the-new-industry-challenging-cisos-in-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals have built structured criminal groups with an organizational model similar to that of a legitimate business. “Cybercrime has become industrialized, a return on investment (ROI)-oriented economy, focused on speed and monetization,” according to Martin Zugec, Bitdefender’s director of technical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zugec explains that this modus operandi of cybercriminal groups is characterized by a high degree of specialization, which includes initial access brokers or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/559049/ransomware-as-a-service-fuels-explosive-growth.html" target="_blank"&gt;ransomware-as-a-service &lt;/a&gt;(RaaS) affiliates. “Today, sophistication is not measured by the complexity of the tools, but by the simplicity and speed of the execution chain,” says Zugec.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This change requires a shift from a threat detection-based approach to one focused on prevention. “Detection has become a commodity that attackers routinely evade so organizations must go beyond reactive monitoring,” says Zugec. “The goal should be to break attackers’ playbooks and make internal environments inherently hostile to them through proactive hardening that eliminates the operational space they need to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The business of cybercrime isn’t new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cybercrime has been operating as an industry for years, meaning it has become professionalized and attacks have been modularized,” says Guillermo Fernández, director of sales engineering for southern Europe at WatchGuard Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, this means that it is no longer necessary for a single attacker to know how to do everything, but rather that the crime is divided into specialties (some steal and resell credentials, others develop and maintain ransomware, others provide infrastructure and negotiation, etc.) and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4096263/alliances-between-ransomware-groups-tied-to-recent-surge-in-cybercrime.html" target="_blank"&gt;all of this is packaged into models as a service&lt;/a&gt;, as we see in the case of ransomware-as-a-service. “This lowers the barrier to entry and reduces the cost of attacking, which explains why we are seeing more and more campaigns and higher volumes,” says Fernández.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, AI helps accelerate the scale and sophistication of some phases or tasks, such as reconnaissance, personalization of deceptions, or automation of parts of the process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How big is it? “The global economic impact of cybercrime is close to $10 trillion. If it were a country’s economy, it would be one of the three world powers, behind only the United States and China. For organizations, this means that it is not enough to react to incidents. Defense must take the same business approach: anticipation, risk management, operational continuity, and resilience by design,” says Juan Francisco Moreda, director of /fsafe, Fibratel’s cybersecurity unit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, cybercrime has become a fully industrialized criminal economy, according to Moreda. “Today we are talking about highly specialized organizations, with as-a-service models (ransomware, phishing, malware), their own supply chains, and a clear focus on profitability and scalability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why Martín Trullás, director of Advanced Solutions at Ingram Micro Spain&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; believes that cybercrime operates with well-organized structures, different professional profiles in its ranks, short- and long-term objectives, and financing that allows it to improve its model with new technology and new strategies to achieve the success of its operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cybercriminals are no longer isolated individuals with computer skills and a desire for quick and easy money, but actors who, in some cases, appear to have state support to use them as part of a struggle that transcends the economic and digital spheres and often enters the realm of geopolitics.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in his opinion, there are still simple gangs of cybercriminals whose goal is money or data, which they then turn into profit by reselling it to third parties. “What’s happening is that they now have better access to more powerful technologies with which they can streamline their operations, attacking with greater speed and in a massive and scalable way. This changes the approach to cyber defense: we can no longer be reactive, equipping companies and users with different levels of ‘shields’ and sitting back to wait for the attack to repel it, but rather we must take action,” Trullás adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why Trullás believes that the best cyber defense strategy must combine passive security with active monitoring of the entire digital ecosystem of the company or user, to reduce the time taken to detect and respond to an incident to limit damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evolution-of-the-security-strategy"&gt;Evolution of the security strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alessandro Armenia, global head of cybersecurity at ReeVo, believes that three key aspects are emerging in the current landscape: “First, attacks are no longer isolated events, but coordinated, in some cases automated, operations that often originate within the organizations themselves, for example, due to human error or exposed credentials. Second, the time factor plays a decisive role: even today, many companies realize they are under attack when it is already too late. Finally, the attack surface is growing faster than companies’ ability to manage it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the defense strategy must also evolve. “It can no longer be based solely on compliance or one-off interventions, but must be continuous, structured, and resilience-oriented,” Armenia explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s despite the fact that companies have the necessary tools to manage their attack surface. “Where they often fail is in the governance model: cybersecurity continues to be approached as a series of isolated compliance exercises over time, and it is precisely in the gaps between one exercise and another that the attacker manages to infiltrate and carry out the attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the reality is: an IT outage becomes a serious problem when the company does not have a plan. “A prepared organization, with defined and tested procedures, is able to recover in a matter of minutes; those that are not prepared run the risk of losing hours, days, and, in some cases, their reputation,” Armenia concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, cybercriminals now have organizational models similar to those of companies. “You can see that there are different types of profiles in these groups, depending on the size of the organization, from the more technical ones, who work in a coordinated team, to the more commercial ones, who are in charge of dealing with victims when negotiation is necessary,” warns David Sancho, senior threat researcher at Trend Micro.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Sancho explains that they often also have people who are responsible for selling the product created to partners or customers, which in the business world would correspond to the channel or the marketing. This is already a reality.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="established-groups"&gt;Established groups&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abraham Vázquez, pre-sales engineer at Infinigate Iberia, gives examples such as the DragonForce or Anubis groups&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which “operate as genuine criminal service providers, offering infrastructure, management panels, technical support, and different extortion models. It is a highly fragmented ecosystem, but at the same time very resilient, capable of adapting and regenerating quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This leads him to conclude that the main implication for defense is that it is no longer enough to react to the final attack. “It is necessary to disrupt the entire criminal chain, reinforcing identity as a central pillar of security, prioritizing proper credential hygiene, greater telemetry capabilities, and rapid containment mechanisms that limit the impact from the early stages of the attack,” Vázquez adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the outlook is not promising. “According to the World Economic Forum, the cybercrime economy will continue to grow, reaching &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/press/2023/01/unchecked-cyberattacks-are-growing-threat-to-fragile-global-economy/"&gt;$23 trillion by 2027&lt;/a&gt;. Industrialized ransomware, automated fraud networks, and converging crime models will drive this growth,” says Gorka Sainz, director of systems engineering at Fortinet Iberia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-role-of-ai-and-automation"&gt;The role of AI and automation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI is the new fuel for the criminal economy. It allows them to scale attacks as if they were marketingcampaigns, &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;argues Salvador Sánchez Taboada of CyberProofUST&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A glance at the business landscape is enough to see that artificial intelligence has become a real multiplier of scale for the criminal economy, enabling the generation of highly granular and personalized phishing campaigns on demand, as Abraham Vázquez argues. “This includes everything from deepfakes of executives to increasingly evasive malware, supported by tools such as WormGPT or FraudGPT. Thanks to these capabilities, attacks are more credible, difficult to detect, and easy to replicate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an example, CrowdStrike’s Threat Hunting &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/threat-hunting-report/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; 2025 reveals how cybercriminals are targeting the tools used to build AI agents. “Their goal is to gain access, steal credentials, and deploy malware, highlighting how autonomous systems and non-human identities are a key part of today’s enterprise attack surface and a growing enabler of large-scale automated attacks,” says Álvaro del Hoy, technology strategist at CrowdStrike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to this, that criminal groups are integrating generative AI directly into ransomware, “using it to automatically create variants and optimize processes such as executing attacks, negotiating with victims, and extortion strategies,” says Abraham Vázquez&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, automation is key to streamlining access, lifecycle, and permission processes, but it also recognizes that attackers seek to exploit identities and privileges at scale, says Albert Barnwell, director of sales for Iberia at CyberArk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This means that offensive automation allows cybercriminals to move faster and exploit compromised identities without friction. Thus, organizations must respond with defensive automation, especially in the management of identity lifecycle, permissions, and rights,” Barnwell adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are already reaching a point where the entire attack cycle can be automated through orchestration: agents who investigate a company and its employees (including social media footprints, interests, and potential weaknesses), others who generate highly targeted and convincing phishing, and chains that lead to malware infection, according to Guillermo Fernández. “From there, the malware itself can learn about the environment and find out what tools and defenses are in place within the company in order to adjust its technique and maximize its impact,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this doesn’t stop at initial access, as even extortion can be automated. It is even possible for the ransom negotiation to be carried out by a bot that adapts its discourse and conditions based on the responses to squeeze out the payment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Martin Zugec says AI is not a magic bullet for attackers. While it has significantly helped to scale social engineering attacks, removing language barriers and improving the quality of decoys, these tools are not particularly useful for the heavier work of an intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We see very little evidence that AI is successfully replacing human expertise in vulnerability research or exploit development. The RaaS ecosystem relies on trust and human ingenuity. The main drivers of successful attacks continue to be hackers and affiliates who operate manually and navigate complex networks. The question is not what AI is capable of doing in theory, but whether it makes sense from an economic standpoint. For a professional threat actor, the cost of managing, adjusting, and securing an AI framework often outweighs the efficiency gains over traditional and proven hacking techniques,” Zugec elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="main-threats-and-attack-vectors-in-2026"&gt;Main threats and attack vectors in 2026&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical context does not invite optimism either. Carlos Castañeda-Marroquin, head of pre-sales and business development at Serval Networks, believes that “in 2026, we will see an increase in hybrid threats driven by geopolitical tensions, where cyberspace is used as an extension of economic and strategic conflicts between states and related groups. This will translate into espionage, digital sabotage, and disinformation campaigns targeting both critical infrastructure and key industrial sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theft of credentials and tokens, the use of infostealers, or the abuse of valid access, combined with a greater emphasis on malware-free techniques and hands-on-keyboard activity, have been gaining ground in recent months, according to David López García, director of operations at Factum. All of this leads, in many cases, to system intrusions that evolve into ransomware and extortion, with increasingly shorter, more automated attack cycles that are clearly aimed at operational and economic impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;López García also warns that in 2026, the extended perimeter and relationships with third parties will gain prominence. “Faced with a larger surface area of exposure, cybercriminals find more opportunities to exploit configurations, identities, and external dependencies, with a greater likelihood of finding a breach in the supply chain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the challenge for organizations is no longer just to protect their systems but to effectively govern an interconnected digital ecosystem, where trust becomes one of the most critical assets and having solid solutions or allies is an operational necessity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of attack vectors, Guillermo Fernández believes that vulnerabilities and weak configurations in remote access and VPNs will continue to be prominent, in addition to the compromise of SaaS tools (accounts, permissions, integrations). “And on the human front, social engineering will become even more effective with advanced phishing and image and voice deepfakes, increasing the risk of fraud. Likewise, we will see more impersonation and initial access. WatchGuard also anticipates that 2026 may be the year of the first agent-based AI-orchestrated end-to-end breach, bringing offensive automation to ‘machine speed,'” Fernández says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are companies investing enough in cyber defenses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A ‘cybersecurity poverty line’ that affects not only budgets, but the availability of strategic leadership and capabilities to define roadmaps, understand key metrics, and evolve toward maturity goals, is an existing issue according to Rafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at Sophos X-Ops. “The strong performance of the cybersecurity market does not eliminate the fundamental gap between real risk and management perception. Sophos predicts that many of the most serious disruptions in 2026 will not be the result of sophisticated techniques, but of basic security hygiene failures that are entirely preventable,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pilling argues that the reality is that having a CISO in a company is now a luxury, highlighting the magnitude of the specialized talent deficit. Companies must understand cyber resilience as a strategic priority at the management level and not just as a technological challenge. This gap between available capabilities and real threats explains why most organizations lack the visibility, controls, and expertise necessary to defend themselves effectively against a highly industrialized criminal ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is clear is that as cyber threats increase, organizations are facing the reality that security attacks are not just a possibility, but a certainty. “At the same time, it is estimated that there is a global shortage of more than 4.7 million qualified professionals, which means that critical security positions are not being filled when they are most needed,” says Gorka Sainz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There remains a clear gap in effectiveness,” says Abraham Vázquez. In his opinion, “many organizations still lack real visibility into their risk exposure, boards of directors maintain a limited level of confidence in defensive capabilities, and third parties continue to play a significant role, being involved in approximately 30% of security breaches.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is still a gap between the complexity of the environment (hybrid, SaaS, multi-cloud) and the maturity of identity controls. Likewise, many organizations still do not consistently apply intelligent privilege controls, while the need to automate the identity and permission lifecycle indicates that current investment is not always sufficient or well targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And not only does this gap exist, but there is also a cultural gap, as Salvador Sánchez Taboada points out. “Many management teams see cybersecurity as an expense, not as a lifesaver,” he acknowledges. In Spain and Latin America, we are working to change that view, relying on integration through AI between existing risk plans and new threats: investing in resilience is like investing in good foundations before building a house. Every change of cycle reminds us that the invisible—like foundations—supports everything we value.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increased spending “is often diverted toward AI hype and supposedly miraculous solutions driven by marketing, rather than addressing real risks,” argues Martin Zugec. That’s why he believes attackers have evolved toward simpler, harder-to-detect techniques, such as LOTL or ClickFix, which weaponize legitimate system tools and user interactions to bypass security layers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This disconnect between where defenders invest and how attackers evolve is a dangerous trend, clearly visible when comparing the findings of real forensic investigations with the narratives popularized in professional networks. This disconnect is reckless,” he warns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ciso-priorities"&gt;CISO priorities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this context, CISOs are forced to continually rethink their defense strategies. “Beyond having solid internal teams and adequate prevention tools, it is increasingly necessary to complement these capabilities with trusted technology partners and insurers capable of managing cyber risk in a more holistic way,” says Vincent Nguyen, director of cybersecurity at Stoïk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As attackers professionalize and scale their operations, Nguyen believes that effective defense requires a proactive and integrated approach that combines advanced cybersecurity solutions, risk transfer through cyber insurance, and operational support when an incident occurs. “Strategic partners with a cross-functional view of risk can accompany organizations before, during, and after an attack, strengthening resilience without replacing internal security leadership,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In any case, Martín Trullas acknowledges that there is no single winning strategy for the CISO, but rather a set of different strategies focused on different areas. “On the one hand, identity security must be strengthened, as it can become a gateway for more serious attacks. And this identity security should no longer be understood only as ‘human identity’ but must also focus on the identity of connected devices, which can also become vectors for attack,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, it is necessary to implement organizational and mindset changes within the company: proper governance, cybersecurity training for all employees, promotion of best practices to reduce risks, and a culture of proactivity to reduce detection and response time in the event of an attack. The entire company must be involved in these processes, because leaving cybersecurity as the sole responsibility of the CISO or the department on duty is a mistake that can be very costly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, this requires CISOs to have the right resources. “And they don’t have it easy, with often unrealistic expectations that cause them to experience signs of burnout,” says Fernando Anaya, general manager of Proofpoint for Spain and Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anaya cites this data: “In Spain, 51% of security managers say they still lack the necessary means to meet their objectives. Similarly, it is crucial to strengthen incident response capabilities, especially considering that a third of Spanish organizations admit to being unprepared. A much more proactive approach is also needed to foster a culture of cybersecurity that goes beyond simply trusting users and includes concrete and effective actions to reduce data loss. The pressure on CISOs is increasing as these resource constraints are combined with such a rapidly changing threat environment, making it imperative that they work to align themselves strategically with their organizations’ boards of directors, seeking a shared vision that ensures the necessary support and appropriate decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Abraham Vázquez believes that it will be essential to advance zero&lt;em&gt;–&lt;/em&gt;trust models and perimeter hardening, eliminating legacy VPNs and accelerating patching processes in &lt;em&gt;edge&lt;/em&gt; environments, as well as ensuring proven resilience through immutable backups and isolated recovery environments. “The automation of detection and response, supported by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3622920/soar-buyers-guide-11-security-orchestration-automation-and-response-products-and-how-to-choose.html" target="_blank"&gt;SOAR &lt;/a&gt;and AI platforms, will enable the cycle between detection and containment to be closed efficiently, effectively reducing response times. Added to this is the need for more mature third-party and supply chain management, based on continuous assessment of cybersecurity posture and minimal but relevant telemetry.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It will be key to conduct internal crisis management exercises that consider realistic scenarios, such as ransomware attacks without payment, fraud using deepfakes of management, or outages of critical suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Fortinet confirms new zero-day attacks against customer devices</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4121682/fortinet-confirms-new-zero-day-attacks-against-customer-devices.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortinet has confirmed that a new attack campaign observed recently against customer devices is exploiting an unpatched issue to bypass authentication. The new attacks are different from a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4107440/fortigate-firewall-credentials-being-stolen-after-vulnerabilities-discovered.html"&gt;previous campaign seen in December&lt;/a&gt; that targeted two vulnerabilities related to FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) authentication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Recently, a small number of customers reported unexpected login activity occurring on their devices, which appeared very similar to the previous issue,” the Fortinet product security team said in &lt;a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/psirt-blogs/analysis-of-sso-abuse-on-fortios"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “However, in the last 24 hours, we have identified a number of cases where the exploit was to a device that had been fully upgraded to the latest release at the time of the attack, which suggested a new attack path.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortinet is currently working on fixing the new issue, which impacts not only FortiCloud SSO, but all SAML SSO implementations. It’s worth noting that FortiCloud SSO is not enabled by default on devices but can become enabled when an administrator registers the device with FortiCare product support from the device’s management interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reports-of-similar-attacks"&gt;Reports of similar attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortinet &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4104499/fortinet-admins-urged-to-update-software-to-close-forticloud-sso-holes.html"&gt;patched two improper cryptographic signature verification issues&lt;/a&gt;, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, in December. These flaws could be exploited to bypass authentication on devices with FortiCloud SSO enabled by sending specially crafted SAML messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after the patches were released, attackers reverse engineered them and launched a campaign to extract configuration files from vulnerable devices. Those files included hashed credentials for other user accounts and details that would allow network mapping.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, researchers from security firm Arctic Wolf &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/arctic-wolf-observes-malicious-configuration-changes-fortinet-fortigate-devices-via-sso-accounts/"&gt;reported seeing a new attack campaign&lt;/a&gt; that started around Jan. 15 in which attackers similarly extracted firewall configurations but also used their access to create new generic accounts and give VPN access to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company noted at the time that it was unsure whether this activity was related to the two December vulnerabilities or to a new zero-day vulnerability. Fortinet has now confirmed the latter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The December flaws affected FortiOS, FortiWeb, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitch Manager, so it’s reasonable to assume the new issue impacts the same devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Fortinet blog post references the same indicators of compromise listed in the Arctic Wolf report, namely malicious accounts created with the email addresses &lt;code&gt;cloud-init@mail.io&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cloud-noc@mail.io&lt;/code&gt;. Other admin accounts are created with the names: &lt;code&gt;audit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;itadmin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;secadmin&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation"&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these or other IOCs such as IP addresses are identified in configurations or the device logs, the system and its configuration should be considered compromised. Fortinet recommends updating the device to the latest available software release, restoring a configuration from a clean backup, and rotating all credentials, including any LDAP/AD accounts that may be connected to the FortiGate devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The setting “Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO” should be set to off, but if any third-party SSO systems are enabled they can still be abused. Administrative access should not be enabled from the Internet for network-edge devices, so Fortinet PSIRT shared a policy configuration that restricts access to the administrative interface only to specific subnets of IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
