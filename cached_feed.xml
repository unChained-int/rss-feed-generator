      <title>Is Your Android TV Streaming Box Part of a Botnet?</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/is-your-android-tv-streaming-box-part-of-a-botnet/</link>
      <description>On the surface, the Superbox media streaming devices for sale at retailers like BestBuy and Walmart may seem like a steal: They offer unlimited access to more than 2,200 pay-per-view and streaming services like Netflix, ESPN and Hulu, all for a one-time fee of around $400. But security experts warn these TV boxes require intrusive software that forces the user's network to relay Internet traffic for others, traffic that is often tied to cybercrime activity such as advertising fraud and account takeovers.</description>

      <title>Root causes of security breaches remain elusive — jeopardizing resilience</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093403/root-causes-of-security-breaches-remain-elusive-jeopardizing-resilience.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-incident analysis remains a critical concern at most security organizations today. According to Foundry’s Security Priorities study, 57% of security leaders report their organization struggled to find the root cause of security incidents experienced in the past year, leaving them at heightened risk of getting breached again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts tell CSO the finding underscores that the immediate pressure to firefight often leaves post-incident learning under-resourced. Organizations need to treat &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009438/how-to-conduct-an-effective-post-incident-review.html"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt; as a continuous learning cycle, not a one-time clean-up exercise if they are to reduce the likelihood of repeat breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations are stuck in a reactive cycle, focusing solely on containing the immediate breach, which comes at the expense of a crucial forensic investigation, leaving the ‘patient door’ wide open for the next attacker to walk right back in,” &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/authors/dray-agha"&gt;Dray Agha&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of security operations at managed security response firm Huntress, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a thorough postmortem to pinpoint the root cause, companies are essentially defending themselves blindfolded, destined to repeat the same mistakes,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-through-root-cause-analysis"&gt;Resilience through root cause analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agree that too many enterprises treat incident response as an operational exercise rather than an analytical one. As a result, containment and recovery actions might be well-rehearsed while deeper forensic investigation and post-incident learning lag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a disciplined approach to evidence preservation and &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/350219/what-is-root-cause-analysis-a-proactive-approach-to-change-management.html"&gt;root cause analysis&lt;/a&gt;, valuable insights are lost,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-moore-724212/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Tom Moore&lt;/a&gt;, director of digital forensics and incident response at managed security services vendor BlueVoyant. “Robust incident response isn’t just about getting systems back online — it’s about using lessons learned to inform detection, prevention, and risk mitigation strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moore adds: “That continuous feedback loop ultimately drives long-term resilience and is particularly valuable when the cyber threat landscape is evolving and adapting so quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariehargraves/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Marie Hargraves&lt;/a&gt;, principal crisis management consultant at cloud security vendor Semperis, agrees that “most organizations focus on fighting fires instead of learning from the flames.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every crisis has three phases: detection, response (the acute phase), and review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the third phase, the post-crisis review, where resilience is built,” Hargraves says. “Organizations that capture real-time data, analyze it rigorously, and act on lessons identified recover faster and emerge stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Incident response isn’t just about surviving; it’s about adapting and building resilience,” Hargraves adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tracing-an-attack-path"&gt;Tracing an attack path&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preparation is key, so businesses need to have dedicated tools and skills for digital forensics in place before an incident occurs through technologies such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/524286/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html"&gt;security incident and event management (SIEM)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/566677/12-top-siem-tools-rated-and-compared.html"&gt;SIEM devices&lt;/a&gt; are important because, for example, many gateway and VPN devices have a local storage that overwrites itself within hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If a cybercriminal breaks in through the VPN and dwells for a day or so before they pivot to business-critical servers, then the VPN telemetry has evaporated into the abyss,” Huntress’ Agha explains. “The centralization and retention of VPN logs, like through a SIEM, allows for reactive detections but also stores valuable data and allows for root cause analysis to figure out how the initial breach [occurred].”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistics from Huntress show that near 70% of sophisticated cybercriminals break in through the VPN. “Where SIEM has been enabled, we are able to catch them much earlier in their attack path, but also deploy retrospective analysis to identify the exact root cause that led to the breach,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various services such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573533/top-12-managed-detection-and-response-solutions.html"&gt;managed detection and response (MDR)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574295/11-top-xdr-tools-and-how-to-evaluate-them.html"&gt;extended detection and response (XDR)&lt;/a&gt; can also include forensic capturing software — technology that enables providers to work hand in hand with forensic cyber investigators to identify the source of the breach and work to remediate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without tools such as this, trying to work back retrospectively to identify the ‘how’ becomes increasingly difficult,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-derbyshire-48291b25/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Rob Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at cybersecurity firm Securus Communication. “There are companies that offer incident response services when breaches occur, but the key to sorting it quickly, and preventing it from happening again, is ensuring you already have the tooling and processes to make any response significantly slicker.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eclecticiq.com/eclecticiq-intelligence-research-team-arda-b%C3%BCy%C3%BCkkaya"&gt;Arda Büyükkaya&lt;/a&gt;, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at EclecticIQ, points out that without thorough root-cause analysis the “actual cause of the attack remains unknown and potentially still active.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Best practices should include digital forensics expertise, root cause analysis processes, and threat intelligence integration to connect incidents to broader attacker tactics and campaigns,” Büyükkaya advises. “This approach allows organizations to build resilience from every incident.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="robust-planning"&gt;Robust planning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An incident response team, typically led by the CISO, should be designated to take charge during an incident. The plan should also specify roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder, from IT staff to legal advisors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts quizzed by CSO say an incident response playbook boils down to a few key steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a tested incident response plan, clear roles, and escalation paths.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection and analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Centralize monitoring, leverage threat intelligence, and ensure forensic capability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containment and recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Act fast but preserve evidence; validate systems before restoration.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postmortem:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct structured reviews, document findings, and feed them into security architecture and training.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate threat modeling, automate containment, and invest in skills development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations opt to use established frameworks and ISO standards as templates for their incident response plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These frameworks offer a structured approach, providing sections and subsections that cover all essential areas, from governance to technical responses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-ford-a4026421/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Richard Ford&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Integrity360. “By using a recognized framework, you not only ensure completeness but also facilitate easier communication with external parties who may be familiar with the framework.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-organizational-resilience"&gt;Building organizational resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective incident response should be geared toward building a structured, repeatable, and intelligence-driven process that strengthens resilience over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incident response plans should be regularly tested, refined, and updated — for example, through simulations or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a wider business continuity and organizational resilience strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharat-mistry-952414/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Bharat Mistry&lt;/a&gt;, field CTO at cybersecurity vendor Trend Micro, says many organizations suffer from a maturity gap in their incident response — which should extend beyond simply containment and recovery to encompass forensic analysis and postmortems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When organizations bypass root cause analysis, they are only treating symptoms,” Mistry warns. “This challenge stems from a combination of issues: fragmented visibility due to siloed tools that prevent accurate attack reconstruction, a skills gap that leaves teams short on forensics and threat hunting expertise, and process weaknesses where postmortems are often informal or simply skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="breaking-the-cycle-of-breach-patch-repeat"&gt;Breaking the cycle of ‘breach, patch, repeat’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, evidence is inadvertently destroyed, such as when servers are wiped, logs are lost, and forensic trails disappear, because the emphasis is on restoring operations quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is compounded by pressure from the business, time constraints, as well as limited resources, which push teams to move on to the next urgent task rather than learning from the incident,” Mistry adds. “As a result, retrospective scans, root cause analysis, and updates to procedures are frequently skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial attack vector and lateral movement often remain unknown, leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed and creating a cycle of “breach, patch, repeat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To break this cycle, organizations must embed forensic readiness into their response strategy: preserve evidence, conduct structured postmortems, and ensure lessons learned are fed back into security architecture and training,” Mistry concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bot w Skull 16z9 v2 " class="wp-image-4084812" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lerbank-bbk22_shutterstock_2367007649_16z9.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;KI-Risiken zu bewerten und zu quantifizieren, ist in der GenAI-Ära unerlässlich.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Lerbank-bbk22 | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie jede Technologie birgt auch künstliche Intelligenz (KI) nicht nur Vorteile. Insbesondere seit dem Aufkommen von Generative AI (&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2821922/was-ist-generative-ai.html" target="_blank" title="GenAI"&gt;GenAI&lt;/a&gt;) und der explosionsartigen Verbreitung entsprechender Tools und Lösungen ist es für Unternehmen wichtiger denn je, die Risiken &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492643/generative-aieine-neue-herausforderung-fur-den-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen"&gt;in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen&lt;/a&gt;. Entsprechend steht das Thema GenAI bei Rechts-, Compliance- und Datenschutzverantwortlichen &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-12-13-gartner-says-legal-compliance-and-privacy-leaders-rank-rapid-generative-ai-adoption-their-top-issue-in-the-next-two-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="einer Gartner-Umfrage"&gt;einer Gartner-Umfrage&lt;/a&gt; zufolge in den nächsten zwei Jahren ganz oben auf der Agenda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um KI-Risiken entgegenzuwirken, neue Bedrohungen zu minimieren sowie Compliance und Datenschutz zu gewährleisten, müssen Anwenderunternehmen ihr KI-Engagement gründlich bewerten, Risiken abwägen und Richtlinien sowie Strategien &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492417/ki-vs-mensch-der-aufstieg-des-ai-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="definieren"&gt;definieren&lt;/a&gt;. Die Bewertungsstrategien unterscheiden sich dabei je nach Art der eingesetzten KI-Lösung. Ganz allgemein lassen sich die Risiken in Zusammenhang mit der Technologie in drei Kategorien einteilen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;interne KI-Projekte,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KI-Lösungen von Drittanbietern sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;schadhafter KI-Einsatz durch Bedrohungsakteure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden nehmen wir die einzelnen Bereiche ausführlich unter die Lupe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="interne-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Interne KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Risiken bewerten zu können, müssen Unternehmen im ersten Schritt wissen, wie künstliche Intelligenz intern eingesetzt wird. Um das zu bewerkstelligen, bieten sich zwei Möglichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Softwareunternehmen Abbyy bewertet und quantifiziert die Performance seiner KI-Modelle schon seit einigen Jahren. Dafür verwendet das Unternehmen Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement – unter anderem das &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="ISO Risk Management Framework"&gt;ISO Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Spezielle Risikomanagement-Frameworks für künstliche Intelligenz werden derzeit erarbeitet – sowohl &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in den USA"&gt;in den USA&lt;/a&gt; als auch &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/de/policies/regulatory-framework-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in Europa"&gt;in Europa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warum Abbyy für seine internen GenAI-Projekte in erster Linie auf ältere Frameworks setzt, erklärt Andrew Pery, AI Ethics Evangelist beim KI-Softwarespezialisten, folgendermaßen: “Diese Frameworks sind noch sehr rudimentär. Es ist noch zu früh, sie zum Einsatz zu bringen. Unser Kernprodukt extrahiert Daten und Inhalte aus Dokumenten und wir haben spezifische Genauigkeitsziele für unsere traditionellen KI-Modelle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut einer &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/state-of-ai-report-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wiz-Untersuchung"&gt;Wiz-Untersuchung&lt;/a&gt; von 150.000 Public-Cloud-Accounts kommen in 70 Prozent der Cloud-Umgebungen inzwischen Generative-AI-Dienste zum Einsatz. Die beliebteste KI-Plattform ist dabei mit 53 Prozent die von OpenAI. Dicht gefolgt von Hugging Face und anderen Open-Source-Projekten. Diese Plattformen zu nutzen, birgt für Unternehmen diverse Risiken, beispielsweise mit Blick darauf, dass eingegebene Daten für das KI-Modelltraining verwendet werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein umfassender Überblick darüber, welche KI-Lösungen wo zum Einsatz kommen, ist deshalb unerlässlich. Laut Priya Iragavarapu, VP of Technology Services bei der Unternehmensberatung AArete, erfordert das sowohl einen Top-Down- als auch einen Bottom-Up-Ansatz: “Unternehmensentscheider sollten Prozesse, bei denen KI beteiligt ist, überprüfen und mit dem KI-Governance-Team &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496105/governance-als-losung-genai-zwischen-akzeptanz-und-verbot.html" target="_blank" title="diskutieren"&gt;diskutieren&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn die Führungskräfte nicht wissen, welche KI wo verwendet wird, kommt der Bottom-up-Ansatz ins Spiel: Alle Endpunkte im Unternehmen werden getrackt, um die Systeme und Benutzer zu finden, die auf KI-Anwendungen zugreifen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das stelle keine perfekte Lösung dar, gibt die Beraterin zu: “Es gibt immer noch Dinge, die unter den Tisch fallen. Aber an dieser Stelle kommt der Aspekt einer gründlichen Schulung beziehungsweise Weiterbildung ins Spiel, um Mitarbeiter vor selbstverschuldeten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3577944/diese-unternehmen-hats-schon-erwischt.html" target="_blank" title="Dummheiten"&gt;Dummheiten&lt;/a&gt; zu bewahren.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Eigene AI Deployment Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen sollten auch ein Framework dafür aufsetzen, wie KI-Modelle im Sinne ihrer jeweiligen Compliance-Umgebung und Risikotoleranz eingesetzt werden. So könnten etwa einige Anwendungsfälle erfordern, dass sämtliche KI-Outputs manuell überprüft werden müssen. “Es gibt mehrere Risikodimensionen, die für generative KI relevant sind”, erklärt Iragavarapu. “Wie viele Menschen sind davon betroffen? Wie groß ist der Impact?” AArete arbeitet mit einigen Unternehmen zusammen, um sie dabei zu unterstützen, diese Risiken zu messen. Für einige Branchen existieren auch bereits erste Generative-AI-Risiko-Benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Bereich, auf den sich jetzt diverse Beratungsunternehmen konzentrieren – Ernst &amp;amp; Young zum Beispiel hat einen “&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ai/platform/our-approach" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Confidence Index"&gt;AI Confidence Index&lt;/a&gt;” entwickelt. Kapish Vanvaria, Risk Markets Leader bei EY Americas, erklärt, was es damit auf sich hat: “Unser Vertrauensindex basiert auf fünf Kriterien – Datenschutz und Sicherheit, Bias und Fairness, Verlässlichkeit, Transparenz und Erklärbarkeit und schließlich die Verantwortlichkeit. Das ist die eine Achse des Indexes. Die andere umfasst Compliance und ethische Grundsätze. So lässt sich eine Heatmap der verschiedenen Prozesse erstellen und eine gewichtete Bewertungsmethode auf jeden einzelnen anwenden.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich Recht und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496124/cloud-security-journey-wie-compliance-bei-accenture-geht.html" target="_blank" title="Compliance"&gt;Compliance&lt;/a&gt; seien diese Berechnungen relativ einfach, weil sie auf Scoring-Werten basierten. In anderen gebe es hingegen mehr Ermessensspielraum, so der EY-Entscheider: “Ein Unternehmen könnte beispielsweise den Reifegrad anhand von Faktoren wie einer Richtlinie zur akzeptablen KI-Nutzung bewerten. Sie können numerische Punktzahlen anwenden, um die Grundlinien zu messen, und wenn sich das Ziel verändert entsprechende Änderungen vornehmen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="drittanbieter-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Drittanbieter-KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsprobleme in Zusammenhang mit Drittanbieter-Services sind &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492170/third-party-risk-management-5-wege-mit-drittanbietern-unterzugehen.html" target="_blank" title="nicht neu"&gt;nicht neu&lt;/a&gt;. Potenziell könnte jeder Anbieter – egal, ob es um E-Mail-, Marketing- oder Daten-Services geht – Zugriff auf sensible Daten haben und diese unter Umständen sogar an seine jeweiligen Partner weitergeben. Risiken dieser Art zu minimieren, war schon vor Generative AI eine Herausforderung für Unternehmen – jetzt haben die Sicherheitsentscheider und ihre Teams gar keine andere Wahl mehr, als &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494219/chatgpt-und-co-was-cisos-beim-einsatz-von-genai-beachten-sollten.html" target="_blank" title="wachsam zu sein"&gt;wachsam zu sein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schließlich könnten Tools, die bislang nicht als Sicherheitsrisiko galten, etwa für die Bildbearbeitung, inzwischen über GenAI-Funktionalitäten verfügen – die hochgeladenen Informationen also bei einer KI landen. Um das zu verhindern, müssen in erster Linie sämtliche Verträge und Nutzungsbedingungen genau studiert und im Auge behalten werden. Darüber hinaus kann ein dediziertes Risikomanagement-Team für Drittanbieter dazu beitragen, Risiken zu minimieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Notch, CISO beim Security-Anbieter Expel, hat noch einen Tipp auf Lager, wenn es darum geht, die Zeichen am Horizont zu deuten: “Wenn ein Anbieter intern neue KI-Funktionen entwickelt, kann eine Änderung seiner Datenschutzrichtlinie ein erster Hinweis darauf sein. Bleiben Sie wachsam!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesem Zusammenhang entfaltet auch die europäische Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) positive Wirkung. Sie verpflichtet Anbieter dazu, offenzulegen, wenn sie mit Subunternehmern zusammenarbeiten. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="externe-ki-bedrohungen-bewerten"&gt;Externe KI-Bedrohungen bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative KI wird längst auch zu unlauteren Zwecken genutzt, etwa um &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495991/google-prognose-2024-genai-verstarkt-phishing-kampagnen.html" target="_blank" title="(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren"&gt;(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren&lt;/a&gt;. Das stellt die Sicherheitsteams in Unternehmen zunehmend vor Probleme, wie CISO Notch konstatiert: “Jede Organisation will sich vor Business E-Mail Compromise schützen. Allerdings sind die Indikatoren dafür, dass es sich um eine nicht koschere E-Mail handelt, sowohl für Menschen als auch für Maschinen immer schwieriger zu erkennen. Künstliche Intelligenz ist in der Lage, E-Mails und Webseiten nahezu perfekt zu fälschen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perys Arbeitgeber Abbyy arbeitet deswegen gezielt mit Sicherheitsanbietern zusammen, die sich auf GenAI-Bedrohungen spezialisiert haben. Dennoch sind die KI-Risiken schwer zu quantifizieren. An dieser Stelle sollen künftig neue Frameworks Abhilfe schaffen – etwa die vom Cybersecurity-Experten Daniel Miessler 2023 veröffentlichte “&lt;a href="https://danielmiessler.com/p/the-ai-attack-surface-map-v1-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Attack Surface Map"&gt;AI Attack Surface Map&lt;/a&gt;“. Sasa Zdjelar, Chief Trust Officer beim Supply-Chain-Spezialisten ReversingLabs, rechnet damit, dass demnächst auch größere Organisationen nachziehen: “CISA, NIST, die Cloud Security Alliance, ENISA und andere werden spezielle Task Forces bilden, die sich mit diesen neuen Bedrohungen befassen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bis es soweit ist, können Unternehmen prüfen, wie gut sie die Grundlagen beherrschen. Dazu gehört beispielsweise, zu überprüfen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle Endpunkte geschützt sind;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle User Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung nutzen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie gut die Mitarbeiter Phishing-Versuche erkennen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie groß der Rückstand in Sachen Patching ist;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;zu welchem Grad &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank" title="Zero-Trust-Prinzipien"&gt;Zero-Trust-Prinzipien&lt;/a&gt; die IT-Umgebung abdecken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese grundlegenden Hygienemaßnahmen können leicht unter den Tisch fallen, wenn neue Bedrohungen auftauchen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus können Firmen auch hinsichtlich neuer und aufkeimender Threats tätig werden, wie Sean Loveland, COO vom Sicherheitsanbieter Resecurity, nahelegt: “Offensive Cyber Threat Intelligence und KI-spezifisches Threat Monitoring können Informationen über neue Angriffsmethoden und Schwachstellen liefern sowie darüber, wie diese monetarisiert werden. Es gibt zum Beispiel ein Produkt namens ‘FraudGPT’, das über das Dark Web und Telegram vertrieben wird.” Dass kriminelle Hacker KI-Tools inzwischen&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492536/chatgpt-wie-cybergangster-generative-ai-nutzen.html" target="_blank" title=" in erheblichem Umfang nutzen"&gt; in erheblichem Umfang nutzen&lt;/a&gt;, kann auch Greg Stewart, Vice President Artificial Intelligence bei SentinelOne, bestätigen: “Wir beobachten eine starke Zunahme von adaptiver und polymorpher Malware, die sich autonom verbreitet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Davon abgesehen ist GenAI jedoch auch in der Lage, das Angriffsvolumen drastisch zu steigern. Das Weltwirtschaftsforum identifiziert in seinem “&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Global Risks Report 2024"&gt;Global Risks Report&lt;/a&gt;” ein weiteres, erhebliches Risiko für Unternehmen: KI-generierte Fehl- und Desinformationen. Schließlich können sich entsprechende Fake News schnell drastisch auf den Aktienkurs eines Unternehmens auswirken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="risikobehaftete-aussichten"&gt;Risikobehaftete Aussichten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unternehmen müssen sich darauf konzentrieren, einen ganzheitlichen Plan zu erstellen, um den Stand der generativen KI in ihrem Unternehmen zu bewerten”, hält Paul Silverglate, Technology Leader bei Deloitte USA, fest. Er ergänzt: “Sie müssen zeigen, dass es für das Unternehmen wichtig ist, es richtig zu machen und darauf vorbereitet zu sein, schnell zu reagieren und Abhilfe zu schaffen, falls etwas passiert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie wahrscheinlich es ist, dass das genau so und zeitnah passiert, ist mit Blick auf eine &lt;a href="https://riskonnect.com/reports/new-generation-of-risk-ahead-of-the-curve-or-behind-the-pack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Riskonnect-Survey"&gt;Riskonnect-Survey&lt;/a&gt; unter 300 Risiko- und Compliance-Entscheidern fraglich:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;93 Prozent der Unternehmen rechnen mit erheblichen Bedrohungen im Zusammenhang mit generativer KI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennoch geben nur 17 Prozent der Teilnehmer an, das gesamte Unternehmen in Bezug auf GenAI-Risiken geschult oder informiert zu haben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lediglich neun Prozent sind nach eigenen Angaben darauf vorbereitet, diese Risiken zu managen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine ähnlich gelagerte ISACA-Umfrage unter mehr als 2.300 Fachleuten aus den Bereichen Audit, Risiko, Sicherheit, Datenschutz und IT-Governance kommt darüber hinaus zum Ergebnis, dass lediglich zehn Prozent der Befragten über eine umfassende &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494657/windows-sicherheit-meets-generative-ai-sind-ihre-richtlinien-schon-ki-ready.html" target="_blank" title="Generative-AI-Richtlinie"&gt;Generative-AI-Richtlinie&lt;/a&gt; verfügen. Noch schlimmer: Mehr als ein Viertel der Befragten plant auch nicht, eine solche zu entwickeln. Gravierende Fehler, wie Silvergate erklärt: “Trust ist &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495889/verbesserungswurdige-compliance-masnahmen-generative-ai-konnte-das-vertrauen-der-kunden-untergraben.html" target="_blank" title="der heilige Gral"&gt;der heilige Gral&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>The CISO’s greatest risk? Department leaders quitting</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094734/the-cisos-greatest-risk-department-leaders-quitting.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar refrain: too much work and not enough compensation and recognition. Yet, while CISOs have seen their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3626973/cisos-embrace-rise-in-prominence-with-broader-business-authority.html"&gt;role grow in prominence and responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, the same cannot be said of functional security leaders who are being asked to do more — but are not reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, this is causing increased job dissatisfaction with career progression and more readiness to exit. For CISOs, this presents a significant risk: If midlevel security managers feel overburdened and under-recognized, the ripple effects can undermine resilience, continuity, and innovation. At a time when cyberattacks continue to grow increasingly more sophisticated and trickier to remediate, CISOs cannot risk &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3998246/53-of-cyber-department-leaders-eyeing-the-exit.html"&gt;functional leader defection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An increased expectation is being placed on functional cyber leaders because they are not only being asked to protect systems but also enable business outcomes — all while managing new regulatory demands, complex technology stacks, and limited resources,’’ says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-lee-hobson/"&gt;Carole Lee Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of PayNearMe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes an expanded attack surface with cloud, SaaS, and AI, leaving functional cyber leaders accountable for risks in their third-party dependencies they can’t fully control, Hobson notes. “Combine that with the 24/7 nature of the job and hybrid work environments, and it’s no surprise burnout is escalating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some 66% of cybersecurity professionals say their role is more stressful now than five years ago, with 63% citing the complex threat landscape as their top stressor, according to ISACA’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.isaca.org/state-of-cybersecurity"&gt;State of Cybersecurity Report&lt;/a&gt;. Further, more than half (55%) of cybersecurity teams are understaffed, and 65% have unfilled cybersecurity positions, the survey found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="systemic-issues-continue"&gt;Systemic issues continue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend of talented and dedicated functional security leaders quietly eyeing the exit is not an anomaly — it’s a predictable outcome of systemic issues that have been building within the profession for years, says &lt;a href="https://centricconsulting.com/team/brandyn-fisher/"&gt;Brandyn Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, V-CISO capability lead at Centric Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As CISOs, we are seeing our most critical layer of management, our directors and senior managers, burn out,’’ Fisher says. “This isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s the result of a dangerous convergence of unrealistic expectations, resource starvation, and a fundamentally broken career model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders operate on an unsustainable premise, Fisher says. “We expect our leaders to be right every single time, while an attacker only needs to be right once. This creates a culture of hyper-vigilance that is simply not sustainable 24/7/365.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teams are expected to be on-call through holidays and weekends, often without commensurate pay, and because a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829440/managing-the-emotional-toll-cybersecurity-incidents-can-take-on-a-team.html"&gt;major incident can mean a four- to six-week response&lt;/a&gt;, personal lives are put on hold, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-malik/"&gt;Monika Malik&lt;/a&gt;, lead data/AI software engineer at AT&amp;amp;T, doesn’t hold back on why functional leaders may be looking to defect. Too often, they are held accountable for projects, yet not given autonomy to make roadmap, staffing, and budget decisions, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security leaders experience burnout when they own the risk and have no roadmap,’’ Malik says. On top of that, there is chronic stress and “breach panic, pager fatigue, and breach aftermath dumpster fires, [which] lead to burnout quicker than compensation can mitigate,’’ Malik says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fisher agrees: “This immense pressure is compounded by a lack of control. A security leader is often the scapegoat for failures originating elsewhere in the organization — a single clicked link by a user, a vulnerability pushed by a development team, or a poor decision by a high-level executive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Functional security leaders are held accountable for defending against threats within environments where they have limited visibility, he says. This means they are “fighting an invisible war on behalf of stakeholders who often don’t understand the stakes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another issue is &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;tool creep&lt;/a&gt;, with 40-plus security tools managing the same alerts and poor integrations, Malik says. There is also “role overload and context switching” on projects, as well as relentless audit cycles, reviews, and meetings, which Malik says leaves little time for career development. “Many organizations have a CISO plus a flat layer of ‘heads of X’” who don’t always have a clear path to moving into higher levels, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And CISOs are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2092097/are-you-a-toxic-cybersecurity-boss-how-not-to-be-a-badly-behaved-ciso.html"&gt;constantly asking their leaders to do more with less&lt;/a&gt;, Fisher adds. “As cybersecurity is still widely viewed as a cost center rather than a business enabler, budgets are the first to be slashed while the threat landscape grows exponentially,’’ he says. “This places managers in the impossible position of being responsible for mitigating enterprise-level risk without the necessary funding for tools or talent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-cisos-can-and-should-be-doing"&gt;What CISOs can and should be doing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation isn’t hopeless; there are steps CISOs can and should take to help avoid defections. It’s a matter of making staff a priority. PayNearMe’s Hobson says CISOs need to ask themselves whether functional security leaders are wearing too many hats with too few opportunities to advance, and if they are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015173/how-cisos-are-training-the-next-generation-of-cyber-leaders.html"&gt;doing enough to nurture&lt;/a&gt; and retain them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CIOs should be asking tough questions about leadership pipelines, succession planning, and the cultural dynamics within their security teams,’’ she says. “If we want to build sustainable security leadership, we need to understand — and address — why so many are eyeing the exit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retention should be thought of as a program that requires additional operating model iterations, rather than something static, according to Malik. She suggests that CISOs implement a &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/287088/project-management-how-to-design-a-successful-raci-project-plan.html"&gt;responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI)&lt;/a&gt; project management tool and give functional security leads authority over their systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They should also be given career paths that include promotions rubrics and “sponsorship — not mentorship — at the executive level, with visibility and board-facing opportunities,’’ Malik says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A portion of compensation should be tied to risk contributions, for example, stats for time to patch, instead of audit fail/success factors, she adds. There also needs to be “tool and telemetry sanity,” which would require CISOs to consolidate vendors and implement a “quarterly kill-switch: If your tool is not reducing MTTR/false positives by date and tool objectives … retire or re-scope the tool as per worst-case expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Centric Consulting’s Fisher thinks success should be tracked by prevention of downtime and system protection, rather than reacting to an incident. At one company he worked at, when the security team started posting data on risk reduction on its dashboards, engagement increased and turnover declined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It increased the visibility of work, which renewed the motivation within teams,’’ he says, adding that it is not often security professionals will leave due to pressure. “They abandon due to the disappearance of their results behind the lack of crisis.” They would more likely feel invested if prevention was used as a metric, Fisher says, “and make security a quantifiable growth aspect rather than an unspoken background role.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-ciso-role-something-to-aspire-to"&gt;Is the CISO role something to aspire to?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asking functional leaders to do more “is a direct reflection of the CISO’s own struggle for influence,” Fisher observes. When a CISO sits under an &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567355/6-signs-the-cio-ciso-relationship-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it.html"&gt;unreceptive CIO or COO&lt;/a&gt; and does not have a seat at the executive table, they cannot effectively advocate for their team’s needs, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This powerlessness trickles down. Managers are left to enforce policy and execute on a strategy they had no input on, with a team that is understaffed and under-equipped for the task,’’ Fisher says. “They carry the responsibility for failure without the authority or resources to ensure success.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most critical issue is that “ambitious security managers are looking up the ladder and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4016334/has-ciso-become-the-least-desirable-role-in-business.html"&gt;seeing a role they do not want&lt;/a&gt;,’’ he adds. “They see their CISO, buried in a 24/7 cycle of stress, personally liable without the same protections as other executives, and struggling to find time for the strategic thought leadership the role demands.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that many see a leadership bottleneck, Fisher says. He believes there is a propensity to promote the best technical experts into the CISO role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While their hands-on experience is valuable,” he acknowledges, “many lack the strategic perspective, business acumen, and leadership skills to build a mature security program and mentor the next generation of leaders. For the aspiring manager who wants to grow into a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080670/what-does-aligning-security-to-the-business-really-mean.html"&gt;business-aligned strategist&lt;/a&gt;, this creates a career ceiling. Why stay and fight an uphill battle for a midlevel salary that doesn’t match the required experience, only to report to a leader who cannot pave the way for meaningful career progression?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Career progression in cybersecurity likely needs to be redefined, Hobson agrees. “It’s not just about climbing a narrow ladder toward the CISO role — there are limited seats at that level, and the field is evolving too quickly for that to be the only path.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are “multiple rewarding paths beyond the traditional CISO path,’’ she says, in areas including AI governance, architecture, and risk. Lateral growth through deep specialization in areas like privacy, threat modeling, and AI governance can be just as valuable and fulfilling, Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="help-functional-leaders-see-meaning-in-their-work"&gt;Help functional leaders see meaning in their work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prevent an exodus, CISOs must fundamentally shift their focus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not enough to recognize that functional leaders are overextended, Hobson says. “CISOs need to restructure workloads, prioritize development, and empower their teams to influence the organization strategically,” she says. “The high-stress role needs to be balanced with professional engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Malik, Hobson says CISOs should also “&lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/405251/the-art-of-delegating-6-tips-for-it-leaders.html"&gt;delegate meaningfully&lt;/a&gt;” to prevent burnout and give functional leaders real autonomy. “Nothing burns out a strong leader faster than being reduced to a messenger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO’s role is to cultivate resilience, belonging, and knowledge in different pathways so leaders see meaning in their work and remain engaged, Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That starts with clarity — helping functional leaders understand how their responsibilities directly support business strategy and reinforcing that security should be a strategic advantage for every company,’’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our primary job is not just to manage risk, but to build a resilient, sustainable organization,’’ Fisher stresses. “That begins with protecting our people from burnout, championing the business value of security in the boardroom to secure necessary resources, and actively mentoring our managers into becoming the strategic leaders this industry needs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Oracle OIM zero‑day: Pre‑auth RCE forces rapid patching across enterprises</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095150/oracle-oim-zero%e2%80%91day-pre%e2%80%91auth-rce-forces-rapid-patching-across-enterprises.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has flagged a pre-authenticated, critical remote code execution flaw in Oracle Identity Manager (OIM), noting that it has been actively exploited, and added it to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flaw was first identified by Searchlight Cyber, which found it capable of allowing complete authentication bypass, enabling RCE through the abuse of a Groovy-script compile endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Taking a closer look at the software running on Oracle Cloud’s login host and our customers’ attack surfaces, we discovered a pre-authentication RCE vulnerability in Oracle Identity Manager,” Searchlight researchers Adam Kues and Shubham Shah said in a blog post. “This pre-authentication RCE we found would also have been able to breach login.us2.oraclecloud.com, as it was running both OAM and OIM.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The now-fixed bug may have potentially exposed hundreds of enterprise and government entities that rely on Oracle’s Identity Management software for user-credential and identity security, researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oracle shipped a fix for the flaw in its October 2025 Critical Patch Update (CPU), which federal civilian agencies can apply immediately to meet CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/11/21/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deadline&lt;/a&gt; of December 12, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="flawed-authentication-filter-allows-bypass"&gt;Flawed authentication filter allows bypass&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability in OIM stems from an authentication-filter implementation that uses a whitelist of URL patterns–a known error-prone design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that appending query strings like “?WSDL” or path parameters like “;.wadl” to protected endpoints ( like “/iam/governance/applicationmanagement/templates;.wadl”), would cause “SecurityFilter” in OIM’s web.xml to treat the route as “unauthenticated”—meaning that it requires no authentication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once past the filter, an attacker can reach the REST endpoint “/application/groovyscriptstatus” meant for syntax-checking Groovy code, not executing it. However, due to Groovy’s annotation processing, researchers demonstrated the ability to inject compile-time code that triggers outbound callbacks and code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flaw, tracked under &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61757" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-61757&lt;/a&gt;, received a critical severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, due to the ease of exploitability and presumably the existence of a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4031603/32-of-exploited-vulnerabilities-are-now-zero-days-or-1-days.html"&gt;zero-day abuse&lt;/a&gt;. “Given the complexity of some previous Oracle Access Manager vulnerabilities, this one is somewhat trivial and easily exploitable by threat actors,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-patching-urgency"&gt;The patching urgency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its CPU &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2025.html"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt;, Oracle addressed this flaw along with hundreds of others across its portfolio. Researchers call it a common Java filter flaw, which makes it a known territory for attackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The vulnerability our team discovered follows a familiar pattern in Java: filters designed to restrict authentication often contain easy-to-exploit authentication bypass flaws,” they &lt;a href="https://slcyber.io/research-center/breaking-oracles-identity-manager-pre-auth-rce/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Logical flaws in how Java interprets request URIs are a gift that continues giving when paired with matrix parameters.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, the flaw affects OIM versions 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.2.1.0. According to Johannes Ullrich, Dean of Research for SANS Technology Institute, the proof-of-concept (POC) URL provided by Searchlight Cyber Research was accessed “several times between August 30th and September 9th” this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attacker IP addresses &lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32506" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; by Ullrich include 89.238.132.76, 185.245.82.81, and 138.199.29.153. Searchlight researchers noted that participating in capture-the-flag (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/552669/ctf-players-versus-professional-penetration-testers.html"&gt;CTF&lt;/a&gt;) style work and probing compile-time or annotation chains continues to yield fresh RCEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Invisible battles: How cybersecurity work erodes mental health in silence and what we can do about it</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094657/invisible-battles-how-cybersecurity-work-erodes-mental-health-in-silence-and-what-we-can-do-about-it.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker never sleeps and neither do you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s how it feels when your job is to stay one step ahead of someone whose only job is to break things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity isn’t just a technical domain. It’s psychological warfare. And for the defenders on the front lines, that war doesn’t stop when the shift ends. It follows you home. It keeps you up at night. It turns vigilance into anxiety. When it finishes with your mind, it drains your energy, robs you of sleep, weakens your health and sometimes steals your sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) investigated the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11861440/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;growing phenomenon of cybersecurity fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and its implications for employee productivity and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaches make the news. Burnout doesn’t. That’s the invisible battle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You signed up to protect systems, not to lose yours. But as the pressure climbs and expectations spiral, mental health becomes the collateral damage no one tracks until people start quitting, breaking or fading out quietly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-makes-cyber-work-so-mentally-damaging"&gt;What makes cyber work so mentally damaging?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t your average 9-to-5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re not just solving puzzles. You’re responsible for keeping a digital fortress from collapsing under relentless siege. That kind of pressure reshapes your brain and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="always-on-alertness"&gt;Always-on alertness&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threats don’t wait. Neither does your pager. You’re expected to respond instantly, on holidays, birthdays, weekends and 2 a.m. system alerts. Even when nothing’s burning, your mind stays wired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That permanent readiness? It’s exhaustion disguised as dedication. Sleep suffers. Focus slips. And when your nervous system never gets to shut down, it starts to fray.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="moral-and-operational-responsibility"&gt;Moral and operational responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One missed patch. One misconfigured access role. One phishing click. That’s all it takes to trigger a million-dollar disaster or worse: erode trust. You carry that weight. When something goes wrong, the guilt cuts deep. Even if the root cause wasn’t yours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’re also stuck in ethical crossfire. Should you monitor employees? Report poor practices to the board? Blow the whistle on ignored risks? It’s not just technical risk. It’s moral trauma.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="isolation-and-underappreciation"&gt;Isolation and underappreciation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many cyber teams operate in silos. You’re either under the radar or in the firing line. The business sees you as the blocker. The board sees you after the breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you’re the lone cyber lead in an SME? You’re on an island, with no lifeboat. No peer to talk to, no outlet to decompress. Just mounting expectations and a growing feeling that nobody really gets what you do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent BBC article reports that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgqn8e4e700o" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cybersecurity professionals are facing rising levels of burnout, fueled by constant high-pressure demands, relentless alerts and a blame-heavy culture&lt;/a&gt;. It warns that without stronger mental-health support, systemic protections and early intervention, many in the field risk long-term harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the reality. Now, let’s discuss what’s exacerbating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="systemic-stressors-that-pour-fuel-on-the-fire"&gt;Systemic stressors that pour fuel on the fire&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t just the job. It’s the way the job is structured. The way leadership treats security. The myths that shape the industry. This is how the system turns pressure into pathology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An article from Oxford University argues that &lt;a href="https://www.infosec.ox.ac.uk/article/cybersecurity-and-mental-health" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our mental health strongly influences how we perceive and respond to cyberthreats&lt;/a&gt;. When we’re stressed, fatigued or depressed, we’re more likely to make mistakes such as clicking on malicious links or ignoring warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="culture-of-perfection-and-silence"&gt;Culture of perfection and silence&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They tell you: Zero breaches. Zero tolerance. Zero visibility into your struggles. The hero narrative still reigns; if you’re not burning out, you’re not trying hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speak up about being overwhelmed? You risk looking weak. Or worse, replaceable. So you hide it. You overcompensate. And eventually, you break, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="role-overload-and-resource-starvation"&gt;Role overload and resource starvation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Budget cuts. Empty roles. Too many tools, not enough hands. You juggle audits, threat intel, board decks, DevSecOps, IAM and compliance. You’re an architect, firefighter and therapist. When one person holds five roles, quality drops. So does morale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadership discusses risk appetite but expects miracles without investing in the team. And when you fail to stop an attack with duct tape and prayer? You’re blamed for not being magical enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="perpetual-change-and-uncertainty"&gt;Perpetual change and uncertainty&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nothing stays still. New threats. New tools. New regulations. You’ve finally mastered a SIEM and now a new AI tool needs to be integrated. DORA lands. NIS2 updates. ISO shifts. They expect you to know it all, yesterday. Certifications become survival badges. And with the wrong culture, they become the only form of recognition you get.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Systemic chaos builds personal crisis. The toll isn’t abstract. It’s physical, emotional and measurable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-the-mind-cracks-what-this-stress-actually-does"&gt;When the mind cracks: What this stress actually does&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stress in cyber isn’t theoretical. It shows up in how you think, feel and lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mental-health-crashes"&gt;Mental health crashes&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress reshapes your nervous system. You can’t focus. You lose sleep. You live in hypervigilance. Some professionals experience panic attacks. Others spiral into depression. Some report PTSD symptoms after handling massive incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imposter syndrome thrives here because you’re always one step behind an adversary who only needs to be right once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="workplace-breakdown"&gt;Workplace breakdown&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burnout doesn’t just hurt you. It spreads. High turnover decimates team continuity. The few who stay get overwhelmed. Teams shrink, knowledge evaporates, pressure spikes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People stop caring. Security becomes checkbox theatre. Cynicism replaces trust. Conversations turn defensive. And when the team stops believing they can win, breaches become inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strategic-risk-amplifies"&gt;Strategic risk amplifies&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tired minds make bad decisions. Fatigued teams miss warning signs. Unacknowledged stress creates blind spots:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadow IT emerges as people bypass slow processes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Over-engineered controls go unchallenged&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Resilience erodes under a false sense of coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, stress causes the very failures you were hired to prevent. But this isn’t fate. It’s a design flaw. And design flaws can be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-build-real-psychological-resilience-in-cyber"&gt;How to build real psychological resilience in cyber&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t need yoga classes or platitudes. You need structured, aligned action at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="at-the-individual-level-protect-the-protector"&gt;At the individual level: Protect the protector&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your triggers.&lt;/strong&gt; Incident response isn’t sustainable without boundaries. If you’re on call, ensure you’re also fully off call.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk early.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t wait for burnout. Therapy, coaching or even peer-to-peer calls can normalize stress without shame.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push for micro boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt; Not every email is urgent. Not every meeting requires you. Defend your calendar the way you defend systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="at-the-organizational-level-change-the-operating-system"&gt;At the organizational level: Change the operating system&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design psychologically safe spaces.&lt;/strong&gt; If people fear speaking up, their silence has already broken your risk radar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define roles properly.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t ask a SOC analyst to handle board governance and expect magic. Split strategy from execution.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track mental health alongside KPIs.&lt;/strong&gt; Pulse surveys, anonymous feedback and burnout rates; these are also security indicators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your best people burn out, no system will save you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="at-the-industry-level-kill-the-hero-myth"&gt;At the industry level: Kill the hero myth&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop valorising burnout.&lt;/strong&gt; We don’t need more martyrs. We need strong teams.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update the frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; Add mental health to ISO. Bake it into NIST. Make wellness part of assurance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fund mental health research in cyber.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s understand what really works. Build toolkits. Train leaders. Equip teams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not about coddling. It’s about capacity. A resilient mind is the best incident response tool you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-you-want-resilient-systems-start-with-resilient-people"&gt;If you want resilient systems, start with resilient people&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the hard truth: Cybersecurity professionals are fighting two battles. One is against adversaries. The other is against a system that expects perfection, rewards self-sacrifice and punishes vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, resilience isn’t about enduring pain. It’s about building systems that don’t produce it in the first place. Stop treating burnout like a badge. Start treating it like a breach. Both are signs that something’s broken. Both are calls to act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we expect defenders to protect the enterprise, we must first defend the defenders. That’s not soft. That’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS S3-Buckets im Visier von Ransomware-Banden</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095199/aws-s3-buckets-im-visier-von-ransomware-banden.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Angriff auf Cloud-Speicher" class="wp-image-4095207" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2558721353.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ransomware-Banden haben ihren Fokus von traditionellen lokalen Zielen auf Cloud-Speicherdienste und insbesondere Amazon S3 verlagert.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; ImageFlow – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein aktueller &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/k/s3-ransomware.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bericht von Trend Micro&lt;/a&gt; beschreibt eine neue Welle von Angriffen, bei denen Angreifer Cloud-native Verschlüsselungs- und Schlüsselverwaltungsdienste integrieren, anstatt lediglich Daten zu stehlen oder zu löschen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Böswillige Aktivitäten, die auf S3 Buckets abzielen, sind nichts Neues, obwohl Unternehmen ihre Cloud-Umgebungen immer besser absichern“, kommentiert Crystal Morin, Senior Cybersecurity Strategist bei Sysdig. „Da Verteidiger stärkere Perimeterschutzmaßnahmen einsetzen, beginnen Angreifer, integrierte Funktionen wie Encryption Management und Key Rotation zu missbrauchen, um Daten zu zerstörren.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Trend Micro untersuchen Angreifer eine Reihe von S3-Konfigurationen, von Buckets mit AWS-verwalteten KMS-Schlüsseln bis hin zu vom Kunden bereitgestellten Keys, importiertem Schlüsselmaterial und sogar vollständig externen Schlüsselspeichern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="warum-s3-ein-begehrtes-ransomware-ziel-ist"&gt;Warum S3 ein begehrtes Ransomware-Ziel ist&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bei On-Premises-Ransomware werden traditionell Malware eingeschleust, Desktops oder Server verschlüsselt und Zahlungen erpresst. Da Unternehmen jedoch wichtige Workloads und Backups in Cloud-Dienste migriert haben, verfolgen Angreifer laut Forschern nun die Daten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Trend-Micro-Bericht listet mehrere wichtige Cloud-Ziele auf, darunter Compute-Snapshots, statische Speicher (S3 Buckets), Datenbanken, Container/Registries und Backup-Tresore. Unter diesen ist S3 besonders wertvoll, da es häufig Backups, Protokolle, Konfigurationsdaten und statische Assets enthält – also Dinge, die ein Unternehmen am dringendsten zurückhaben möchte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um erfolgreich zu sein, suchen Cyberkriminelle in der Regel nach S3 Buckets, bei denen Folgendes der Fall ist:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versionierung deaktiviert (alte Versionen können nicht wiederhergestellt werden),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Objekt-Sperre deaktiviert (Dateien lassen sich überschreiben oder löschen),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;weitreichende Schreibberechtigungen (durch falsch konfigurierte IAM-Richtlinien oder durchgesickerte Anmeldedaten), und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;hochwertige Daten (Backup-Dateien, Produktionskonfigurations-Dumps).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sobald sie sich Zugang verschafft haben, versuchen die Angreifer, eine „vollständige und irreversible Sperrung” der Daten zu erzwingen. Dazu können sie Objekte mit für das Opfer unzugänglichen Keys verschlüsseln, Backups löschen und die Löschung von Schlüsseln planen, damit AWS und der Kunde die Daten nicht wiederherstellen können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cloud-verschlusselung-und-schlusselverwaltung-als-waffe"&gt;Cloud-Verschlüsselung und Schlüsselverwaltung als Waffe&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trend Micro hat fünf &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3803194/perfide-ransomware-attacke-gegen-aws-nutzer.html" target="_blank"&gt;S3-Ransomware&lt;/a&gt;-Varianten identifiziert, die zunehmend die in AWS integrierten Verschlüsselungspfade ausnutzen. Eine Variante missbraucht die standardmäßigen, von AWS verwalteten KMS-Schlüssel (SSE-KMS), indem sie Daten mit einem vom Angreifer erstellten Schlüssel verschlüsselt und diesen Schlüssel zur Löschung vormerkt. Eine andere Variante verwendet vom Kunden bereitgestellte Schlüssel (SSE-C), von denen AWS keine Kopie hat, sodass eine Wiederherstellung unmöglich ist. Die dritte Variante exfiltriert S3-Bucket-Daten (ohne Versionierung) und löscht die Originale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die letzten beiden Varianten dringen tiefer in die Key-Management-Infrastruktur &lt;a&gt;ein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#_msocom_2"&gt;[MB2]&lt;/a&gt; . Eine stützt sich auf importiertes Schlüsselmaterial (Bring your own key – &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-byok-bring-your-own-key-to-aws-kms-for-less-than-15-00-a-year-using-aws-cloudhsm/"&gt;BYOK&lt;/a&gt;), wodurch Angreifer Daten verschlüsseln und anschließend die importierten Schlüssel zerstören oder ungültig machen können. Die andere missbraucht den External Key Store (XKS) von AWS, bei dem Schlüsseloperationen außerhalb von AWS stattfinden. Das bedeutet, dass weder der Kunde noch AWS den Zugriff wiederherstellen können, wenn Angreifer die externe Schlüsselquelle kontrollieren. Zusammengenommen zeigen diese Techniken, dass Angreifer AWS selbst als Verschlüsselungsmechanismus nutzen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Ich kann mich nicht erinnern, dies jemals in der Praxis gesehen zu haben“, betont Trey Ford, Chief Strategy and Trust Officer bei Bugcrowd. „Diese Untersuchung ist eine systematische und theoretische Bedrohungsmodellierung. Sie zeigt auf, wie ein Angreifer eine AWS-Umgebung innerhalb einer Kontogrenze verschlüsseln und Lösegeld dafür verlangen könnte.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ford fügt hinzu: „Dies zielt speziell auf die Verwendung externer oder vom Kunden bereitgestellter Schlüssel (SSE-C bzw. XKS) ab, um die Kontrolle über die Schlüsselverwaltung für die in der Speicherung verwendete Kryptografie zu erlangen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="schutzmasnahmen"&gt;Schutzmaßnahmen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Trend-Micro-Forscher fordern Kunden dringend auf, ihre S3-Umgebungen zu sichern, indem sie Least-Priviledge-Zugang erzwingen und Schutzmaßnahmen wie Versionierung und Object Lock aktivieren. Zudem sollten Unternehmen bereitgestellte oder externe Schlüsselquellen, die die Wiederherstellung beeinträchtigen können, streng regulieren. Außerdem wird empfohlen, Backups in separaten Konten zu isolieren und die Cloud-Audit-Protokolle kontinuierlich auf Anzeichen verdächtiger Schlüsselaktivitäten, Massenverschlüsselung oder groß angelegte Objektlöschungen zu überwachen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Eine ‚Assume Breach‘-Mentalität ist in der Cloud unerlässlich: Laufzeitumgebungen sollten unveränderlich sein, Identitäten müssen über streng begrenzte Berechtigungen und kurzlebige Anmeldedaten verfügen“, erklärt Morin von Sysdig. Nach Meinung des Experten benötigen Netzwerke eine sinnvolle Segmentierung und kritische Datensätze müssen gesichert werden. „Moderne Betriebsabläufe sind von komplexen Lieferketten abhängig, und eine Ransomware, die einen wichtigen Partner betrifft, kann Ihr Unternehmen genauso vollständig lahmlegen wie eine direkte Kompromittierung.“ (jm)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="_msocom_2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>What keeps CISOs awake at night — and why Zurich might hold the cure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094608/what-keeps-cisos-awake-at-night-and-why-zurich-might-hold-the-cure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sleepless-nights-in-cybersecurity"&gt;Sleepless nights in cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I attended the Global Cyber Conference 2025 in Zurich last week, I expected world-class keynotes and sharp panel debates. What I didn’t expect were so many conversations about sleep. Or rather, the absence of it. The exhaustion was palpable — red eyes, half-empty coffee cups and the quiet admission from one CISO: “I haven’t slept through the night in six months.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a keynote titled “The 2025 threat landscape – What keeps CISOs awake at night,” Tim Brown, CISO at SolarWinds, distilled the collective anxiety of an entire profession into five painfully accurate points. His slides weren’t just data — they were a mirror held up to a room full of leaders who live in a state of permanent vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was one of those rare sessions where the room fell silent — not from boredom, but recognition. The CISOs around me weren’t snapping LinkedIn photos; they were nodding, half-smiling, half-grimacing. Because every slide mirrored what we all feel: constant acceleration, persistent uncertainty and diminishing control. One European bank CISO whispered, “That’s my risk register — on a bad day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-safe-space-in-the-alps"&gt;A safe space in the Alps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over two days at Zurich’s stunning Dolder Grand — hosted by the Swiss Cyber Institute — I witnessed something I’ve seldom seen at cybersecurity events: real vulnerability. In a closed, attribution-free environment, leaders shared not just strategies, but doubts. And that made this event stand out — not as another conference, but as a safe space for CISOs to drop their armor. The Dolder Grand’s panoramic views over Lake Zurich and the Alps provided a serene contrast to the high-stakes discussions inside, amplifying the sense of a neutral, reflective sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zurich, with its alpine precision and global neutrality, was the perfect backdrop. The theme &lt;em&gt;Future Resilience&lt;/em&gt; echoed everywhere, but the magic happened in the margins: pre-conference coffee chats, late-night Swiss CISO Awards talks, quiet lounge exchanges. The SCI has built something extraordinary — a community where CISOs exchange phone numbers, not just slides. Multiple leaders told me they now call peers directly during live anomalies. That’s trust you can’t buy. One manufacturing CISO shared how a Zurich contact helped him contain a supply-chain incident in under four hours — something that previously took days through formal channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-threats-that-hit-home"&gt;5 threats that hit home&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are Brown’s five threats — straight from the slides, raw insights from the room and my takeaways as a consultant advising energy, manufacturing and finance giants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-the-shrinking-window-between-discovery-and-exploitation"&gt;1. The shrinking window between discovery and exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown’s first slide hit like a gut punch: “Time between discovery and exploitation continues to decrease while CVE publishing increases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That line summarizes 2025’s cyber reality. &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MITRE tracked over 39,000 CVEs in 2025&lt;/a&gt; alone so far, with &lt;a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/m-trends-2025-en.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mandiant’s M-Trends 2025&lt;/a&gt; showing exploits weaponized in days — or hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One CISO described a zero-day that went from disclosure to active ransomware in 19 hours. “We patched 40,000 endpoints overnight,” he said. “Next time? We might not have 19 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my practice, I see quarterly scans failing. My fix for clients: Automated, risk-based patching — integrate exposure tools with CMDBs to prioritize crown jewels. Post-Zurich, I’m piloting this for an energy client: zero-downtime OT patching via virtual patching. Speed isn’t optional; it’s survival. Tools like Tenable or Qualys, when linked to asset inventories, can cut prioritization time from days to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-motivated-threat-actors-and-the-end-of-deterrence"&gt;2. Motivated threat actors – and the end of deterrence&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Motivated threat actors facing little consequences — the starfish and the spider. The spider model is not working.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brown nailed it, channeling &lt;em&gt;The Starfish and the Spider&lt;/em&gt;. But his real analogy was Napster vs. iTunes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We shut down one file-sharing network, three more popped up. The music industry didn’t win by closing platforms — they won by making legal downloads cheaper and easier. We’re still trying to shut down the networks instead of changing the economics.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s DBIR 2025 confirms&lt;/a&gt;: Ransomware in 44% of breaches (up 37% YoY), with groups recycling TTPs days post-takedown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My client takeaway: Ditch perimeters for behavioral detection (UEBA in SIEMs). Join ISACs or SCI networks — isolation loses. One manufacturing client now shares IOCs in real-time; containment time dropped 40%. Platforms like Splunk or Microsoft Sentinel with UEBA modules make this shift practical and measurable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-the-third-party-paradox"&gt;3. The third-party paradox&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Third-party risk — we need to expect more from vendors and consumers of technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laughter rippled — bitter, knowing. Post-SolarWinds/MOVEit, 62% of breaches involve third parties per &lt;a href="https://www.kiteworks.com/cybersecurity-risk-management/third-party-access-risks-manufacturing-2025-ponemon-report/"&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One CISO: “We audited their SOC 2 — but not their firmware update process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-Zurich framework update (bullets for you):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live API feeds for vuln/compliance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Joint tabletops quarterly&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Contracts: 72-hour notify + shared remediation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCI’s cross-industry working groups made this actionable. For a finance client, this slashed vendor risk score by 35%. Integrating tools like BitSight or SecurityScorecard into vendor portals automates much of this oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-ai-the-fastest-arms-race-in-history"&gt;4. AI – the fastest arms race in history&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI — we’re in a race. Can we use it faster and better than the adversary?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI powers both sides. Workshop demo: LLMs craft phishing bypassing gateways 94%. Deepfakes in &amp;lt;10 mins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One CISO: “We’re using AI to simulate attacks in a sandbox, training our SOC on synthetic TTPs.” I’m piloting this with a manufacturing client — GenAI generates polymorphic malware for rule-testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OWASP Top 10 for LLMs&lt;/a&gt; now mandatory: Prompt injection #1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Classify models as critical assets — threat model them. Treating LLMs like any other high-value system, with access controls and logging, is now non-negotiable in mature programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-stress-and-burnout-the-human-threat-surface"&gt;5. Stress and burnout – the human threat surface&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Deputy CISOs reluctant to become CISOs, CISOs leaving the industry, burnout for our teams.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The room broke. &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;69% report rising burnout&lt;/a&gt;; deputies flee the role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stories: Missed birthdays, divorces, no vacations in years. One CISO admitted, “My daughter asked if I still work here.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Closing Apéro: Impromptu support. “CISO hotlines” for 3am Swap: Sabbaticals, peer circles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One leader: “Resilience is now part of my risk register.” Framable. Tweetable. True.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My new audit: People = risk vector. Morale checks alongside firewalls. Simple pulse surveys and rotation policies can yield measurable improvements in team retention and alertness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-zurich-set-a-new-benchmark"&gt;Why Zurich set a new benchmark&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Global Cyber Conference 2025 wasn’t just another industry gathering — it was a living network. The Swiss Cyber Institute has created a space where trust isn’t a buzzword; it’s the default setting. The vendor-free format ensures candid exchanges, free from sales pitches, fostering genuine collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple CISOs told me they now call peers directly when anomalies appear in shared supply chains — not through formal channels, but through relationships built in Zurich. That level of collaboration doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of a carefully curated, vendor-free environment where leaders can speak freely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a field drowning in alerts and noise, this event cuts through. CISOs don’t just attend — they belong. The sense of community extends beyond the conference, with SCI maintaining active working groups and a secure messaging platform for year-round peer support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you advise security leaders, govern risk or build resilience programs, put the Global Cyber Conference on your radar for next year. The Swiss Cyber Institute typically announces dates in early spring. In the meantime, the connections made in Zurich this year are already saving response time — and sleep — for hundreds of leaders across Europe and the US. The return on investment isn’t measured in swag or slides, but in faster incident response, shared playbooks and the rare gift of knowing you’re not alone at 3am.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hall of Fame &lt;a href="https://event.foundryco.com/cso-conference-awards/awards/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;award nominations are officially open&lt;/a&gt;, and we’re calling on you, your peers, teams and clients to recognize the individuals and organizations driving smarter, safer, and stronger cybersecurity strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Get your nominations in today. The December 3 deadline is fast approaching. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter here: &lt;a href="https://event.foundryco.com/cso-conference-awards/awards/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2026 CSO Conference &amp;amp; Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now entering its eighth year, the CSO Hall of Fame spotlights outstanding leaders who have significantly contributed to the practice of information risk management and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This award honors trailblazers (security leaders with 10+ years in a CSO, CISO or other C-level security position) whose careers have shaped the future of cybersecurity and risk management. Inductees are recognized for their lifetime achievements and enduring contributions to the profession.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Honorees will be recognized at the &lt;a href="https://event.foundryco.com/cso-conference-awards/awards/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CSO Conference + Awards&lt;/a&gt; May 11-13, 2026 in Nashville, TN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the event, attendees will have the opportunity to connect with hundreds of peers, industry leaders, and security executives who will showcase demonstrable business value in their projects from AI to application security to zero trust.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Shai-Hulud worm spreading through npm, GitHub</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095578/new-shai-hulud-worm-spreading-through-npm-github.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new version of the Shai-Hulud credentials-stealing self-propagating worm is expanding through the open npm registry, a threat that developers who download packages from the repository have to deal with immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-2-0-ongoing-supply-chain-attack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at Wiz Inc. said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that in the early stages of the campaign late last week,&lt;sup&gt;  &lt;/sup&gt;a thousand new GitHub repositories containing harvested victim data were being added every 30 minutes. &lt;a href="https://research.jfrog.com/post/shai-hulud-the-second-coming/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;And researchers at JFrog identified 181 compromised packages.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current campaign introduces a new variant, which Wiz researchers dub Shai-Hulud 2.0, that executes malicious code during the preinstall phase, “significantly increasing potential exposure in build and runtime environments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat leverages compromised package maintainer accounts to publish trojanized versions of legitimate npm packages. Once installed, the malware exfiltrates developer and CI/CD secrets to GitHub repositories, and also inserts the malicious payload into all of the users’ available npm packages. Threat actors could also use the exfiltrated secrets to break into and install more malware in victims’ IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JFrog said this new variant generates randomized repository names for exfiltration, making it harder for security teams to hunt down and scrub the leaked secrets. JFrog also said the new payload contains new functionality, including privilege escalation, DNS hijacking, and the ability to delete data from the victim’s machine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple popular packages used by developers, including those from Zapier, ENS Domains, PostHog, and Postman, have been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/another-shai-hulud-npm-worm-is-spreading-heres-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at ReversingLabs also noted &lt;/a&gt;the list of compromised packages includes AsyncAPI related packages, including &lt;a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/@asyncapi/specs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@asyncapi/specs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has had more than 100 million lifetime downloads and an average of 1.4 million weekly downloads. This package in particular is also believed to be the ‘patient-zero’, or the first known infected package, for this wave of attack, the researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="second-wave-is-bigger-and-faster"&gt;Second wave is bigger and faster&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers and security teams looking for indicators of compromise should note that the new variant adds two new payload files: &lt;em&gt;setup_bun.js&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bun_environment.js&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The re-emergence of the worm indicates that this remains a current and serious threat to the npm ecosystem,” said &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute. “CSOs must address this threat by monitoring the components used in their software and hardening their CI/CD pipelines to increase resilience in the event that malicious code is executed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4058059/warning-hackers-have-inserted-credential-stealing-code-into-some-npm-libraries.html" target="_blank"&gt;first emerged in September&lt;/a&gt;, revealed by the discovery that dozens of npm libraries, including a color library with over 2 million downloads a week, had been replaced with malicious versions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial Shai-Hulud wave was already one of the most severe JavaScript supply-chain attacks Wiz has seen, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/merav-bar-608351232/?originalSubdomain=il" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Merav Bar&lt;/a&gt;, a company threat researcher and co-author of the report told &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt;. “This new wave is bigger and faster: more than 25,000 attacker-created repos across roughly 350 GitHub users, growing by about 1,000 repos every 30 minutes, with malware that steals developer and cloud credentials and runs in the preinstall phase, touching dev machines and CI/CD pipelines alike. That combination of scale, speed, and access makes it a high-impact campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="assume-compromise"&gt;Assume compromise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an individual had pulled any of the affected packages during the November 21–23 window, she said, they should assume their environment is exposed. Remedies include clearing the npm cache on their workstation, removing &lt;em&gt;node_modules&lt;/em&gt;, reinstalling from clean versions, or pinning to versions published before the malicious releases, and rotating any tokens or secrets that were present (GitHub PATs, npm tokens, SSH keys, cloud credentials).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enabling strong MFA on GitHub/npm and watching for unexpected new repos or workflow files in the developer’s personal account is also critical, she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud’s second wave isn’t surprising, said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-laporte/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brad LaPorte&lt;/a&gt;, cybersecurity advisor at Morphisec. “The first attack showed how easily preinstall scripts could be weaponized. This wave proves what happens when those warnings aren’t acted on: larger scale, more destructive payloads, and automation that infects thousands of repositories in hours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations-for-repositories"&gt;Recommendations for repositories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stop attackers from easily uploading malicious packages, npm needs to tighten its publishing process, LaPorte said, including ensuring the identity of new accounts is verified before they are allowed to publish packages; implementing rate limits to prevent attackers from uploading multiple malicious packages in a short period and monitoring package maintainers for suspicious activity such as sudden spikes in publishing or packages with significant unexplained changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From what we’ve observed in the Shai-Hulud incidents,” said Bar of Wiz, “the core issue isn’t npm specifically. It’s that open-source registries now function as high-impact distribution hubs, and attackers are taking advantage of how much trust developers place in them. In that context, the most important thing is continuing to strengthen the guardrails around how packages are published and updated. That includes making it harder for compromised maintainer accounts to push malicious versions, increasing visibility into unusual publishing behavior, and helping downstream users quickly understand when a package version may be unsafe. Those are ecosystem-level defenses rather than criticisms of any single registry, but they reflect the direction the entire open-source community will need to move as attacks like Shai-Hulud become more automated and far-reaching.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar, cautioned that Shai‑Hulud isn’t what he called typical package compromise. “It’s a worm embedded into the dev supply chain. It signals that attackers are shifting from targeting compiled binaries and runtime environments toward the very processes developers use to build and ship software. No organization should assume, ‘We don’t use npm, so we’re safe’, because even downstream dependencies or dev toolchains can become the launch pad.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far npm has focused on ensuring that package authors are properly authenticated and that packages are not altered after being published, said Ullrich of the SANS Institute. But, he added, this does not prevent a malicious actor from publishing malicious packages. Recently, npm further restricted the default access token lifetimes and started to revoke legacy ‘classic tokens,’ he acknowledged. “npm may need to implement some form of automated scanning for obvious malicious content, but it will be difficult to implement a meaningful solution.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations-for-security-teams-developers"&gt;Recommendations for security teams, developers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wiz says security teams in organizations with application developer teams that use npm – and individual developers using npm and GitHub – should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clear each developer’s npm cache;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;pin dependencies to known clean versions or roll back to pre-November 21 builds;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;revoke and regenerate npm tokens, GitHub PATs, SSH keys and cloud provider credentials;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;enforce phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for developer and CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within GitHub and CI/CD environments, they should search for newly-created repositories with ‘Shai-Hulud’ in the description, review unauthorized workflows or suspicious commits referencing hulud, and monitor for new npm publishes under their organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For long-term protection CSOs and IT leaders are urged to restrict or disable lifecycle scripts (postinstall, preinstall) in CI/CD environments, limit outbound network access from built systems to trusted domains only, and make sure developers use only short-lived, scoped automation login tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Eine wachsende Zahl von Unternehmen setzt inzwischen auf eine &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/a/4008348" target="_blank"&gt;Multicloud-Strategie&lt;/a&gt; – in erster Linie, um Workloads genau dort auszuführen, wo es für den jeweiligen Anwendungsfall am günstigsten ist. Und zwar ohne zusätzliche Komplexitäten zu schaffen. Das kann diverse Vorteile realisieren, zum Beispiel in Zusammenhang mit Compliance und Verfügbarkeit. Multicloud-Initiativen können jedoch auch neue Sicherheitslücken entstehen lassen, die diese Benefits im Handumdrehen wieder zunichte machen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicherheit in Multicloud-Umgebungen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495736/cloud-security-strategie-in-die-cloud-aber-mit-sicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;zu gewährleisten&lt;/a&gt;, ist unabhängig von der Unternehmensgröße eine nicht zu unterschätzende Herausforderung. Glücklicherweise können einige relativ simple Methoden und Best Practices dazu beitragen, Angreifer fernzuhalten und Cloud-übergreifend eine sichere, widerstandsfähige Infrastruktur aufzubauen. Welche das sind, haben wir im Gespräch mit einigen Sicherheitsexperten herausgearbeitet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-zentrale-autoritat-aufbauen"&gt;1. Zentrale Autorität aufbauen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT-Sicherheit liegt bekanntlich in der Verantwortung der gesamten Belegschaft. Dennoch macht es Sinn, ein zentrales Team (oder eine zentrale Rolle) einzurichten, das die Übersicht über sämtliche Security-Angelegenheiten wahrt – und diese strategisch steuert. Dieser Überzeugung ist auch &lt;a href="https://www.securitycompass.com/about-us/trevor-young/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Trevor Young&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Product Officer beim Sicherheitsdienstleister Security Compass: “Dieses Team beziehungsweise diese Rolle sollte koordinieren und eng mit Anwendungs-Teams und Cloud-Ownern zusammenarbeiten.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die zentrale Autorität in Sachen IT-Sicherheit ist dafür zuständig:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eine umfassende Sicherheitsstrategie zu definieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;einheitliche Richtlinien und Standards einzuziehen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cloud-übergreifende Security-Tools auszuwählen und zu managen, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Compliance in sämtlichen Cloud-Umgebungen sicherzustellen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-einheitliche-governance-etablieren"&gt;2. Einheitliche Governance etablieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein einheitliches Security-Governance-Modell, das alle Cloud-Umgebungen umfasst und durch zentralisiertes &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2763035/was-sie-ueber-iam-wissen-muessen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Identity Management&lt;/a&gt;, Automatisierung und Policy Enforcement unterstützt wird, ist mit Blick auf Multicloud-Umgebungen ebenfalls ratsam.  Nigel Gibbons, Director und Senior Advisor beim Sicherheitsdienstleister NCC Group, outet sich als Anhänger dieses Ansatzes und fasst seine Vorteile zusammen: “Das kann Komplexität reduzieren und Silos auflösen. Zudem reduziert es blinde Flecken, setzt das Least-Privilege-Prinzip durch, ermöglicht es, Bedrohungen in Echtzeit zu erkennen und optimiert die Compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Risiken über sämtliche Clouds hinweg zuverlässig zu erfassen, empfiehlt Gibbons CISOs und ihren Teams, sich eng mit DevOps-, Plattform- und Compliance-Teams abzustimmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-scope-erweitern"&gt;3. Scope erweitern&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Sie nur auf eine Cloud setzen, liegt der Fokus meist auf dessen spezifischen Security-Tools und -Services – die Sie im Laufe der Zeit vermutlich immer besser durchdringen. Sind Sie dagegen in mehreren Clouds unterwegs, steigt das Komplexitätslevel drastisch. Denn dann gilt es nicht nur, sich mit mehreren, proprietären Sicherheitsmodellen, Diensten und Terminologien auseinanderzusetzen, wie Security-Compass-Experte Young festhält: “Man kann sich nicht einfach auf die nativen Tools eines Cloud-Anbieters verlassen und erwarten, dass diese alle wichtigen Aspekte abdecken. Eine Multicloud-Umgebung erfordert eine breitere, herstellerunabhängige Strategie.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut dem Experten müssen Anwender, die die Security-Tools der einzelnen Cloud-Anbieter ohne einheitliche Strategie einsetzen, mit zahlreichen Problemen rechnen – beispielweise:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inkonsistenten Richtlinien,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Lücken in der Abdeckung oder&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Security-Events, die sich nicht Cloud-übergreifend korrelieren lassen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Das ist, als hätte man diverse verschiedene Wachleute, die nicht miteinander kommunizieren, aber verschiedene Teile desselben Gebäudes &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493920/10-essenzielle-masnahmen-fur-physische-sicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;bewachen sollen&lt;/a&gt;. Es kommt zwangsläufig zu Sicherheitslücken”, stellt Young in Aussicht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-trust-boundary-konstruieren"&gt;4. Trust Boundary konstruieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hören Sie ganz generell auf damit, in Clouds zu denken”, empfiehlt  &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevetcherchian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Tcherchian&lt;/a&gt;, CISO beim Sicherheitsanbieter XYPRO, und erklärt: “Behandeln Sie jede Umgebung – egal ob AWS, Azure, On-Prem oder Legacy-Mainframe – als Teil einer singulären, einheitlichen Trust Boundary und richten Sie Kontrollmaßnahmen rund um Identitäten, Datenflüsse und Kontexte ein – nicht um Plattformen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anwender, die ihre Sicherheitsstrategie “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492887/aws-google-und-azure-im-vergleich-welcher-hyperscaler-ist-der-sicherste.html" target="_blank"&gt;pro Cloud&lt;/a&gt;” konzipierten, hätten damit bereits ihre Kontrollmöglichkeiten fragmentiert und dürften sich schwertun, das wieder zu bereinigen, ist der CISO überzeugt: “Mit Clouds verhält es sich ein bisschen wie mit Klempnerarbeit: Sicherheitsentscheider und -teams, die zu stark auf Cloud-native Tools fixiert sind, improvisieren am Ende oft abenteuerliche Lösungen, die nicht wirklich zusammenpassen und zeitnah lecken.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-verantwortung-ubernehmen"&gt;5. Verantwortung übernehmen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obwohl Multicloud-Security nicht nur Sicherheitsentscheider angeht, ist &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/ensar-seker/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ensar Seker&lt;/a&gt;, CISO beim Threat-Intelligence-Spezialisten SOCRadar, davon überzeugt, dass seiner Berufsgattung am Ende des Tages der wesentliche Teil der Accountability zuteil werden sollte: “Letztendlich muss der CISO sicherstellen, dass Technologie-unabhängige Sicherheitsrichtlinien auf- sowie konsequent durchgesetzt werden und mit der Risikotoleranz des Unternehmens in Einklang stehen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dabei sei insbesondere entscheidend, Silos zwischen Teams aufzubrechen und sicherzustellen, dass die Cloud-übergreifende Transparenz unter einer einheitlichen SecOps-Funktion zentralisiert ist, so Seker. “Multicloud ist nicht nur eine Technologiestrategie, sondern sichert auch betriebliche Resilienz. Anwender sollten in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3994110/threat-intelligence-plattformen-ein-kaufratgeber.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud-Bedrohungsinformationen&lt;/a&gt; investieren, die übergreifende Angriffsmuster widerspiegeln. Zudem empfiehlt sich der Einsatz von  Laufzeitüberwachung und Policy Drift Detection, um kontinuierliche Sicherheit zu gewährleisten.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-kollaborative-management-umgebung-fordern"&gt;6. Kollaborative Management-Umgebung fördern&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effektives Security-Management erfordert auch, dass Sicherheitsteams und andere &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2801444/so-bringen-sie-it-und-fachabteilung-unter-einen-hut.html" target="_blank"&gt;wichtige Stakeholder&lt;/a&gt; zusammenwirken. “Nur so lassen sich sämtliche Maßnahmen auf die übergeordneten Business-Ziele abstimmen”, unterstreicht &lt;a href="https://centricconsulting.com/team/brandyn-fisher/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brandyn Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Security Services bei Centric Consulting. Je nach Organisationsstruktur und Komplexität des Anwenderunternehmens umfasse diese Zusammenarbeit in der Regel Lösungsarchitekten, Cloud-Spezialisten und Systemadministratoren, so Fisher. Er fügt hinzu: “Der effektivste Ansatz ist eine klare Aufteilung der Verantwortlichkeiten.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In der Regel definiere das Sicherheitsteam die Anforderungen und Governance-Rahmenbedingungen, während die Umsetzung ein technisches Team übernehme, so der Chefberater. “Dieser ausgewogene Ansatz schafft klare Zuständigkeiten und fördert gleichzeitig die funktionsübergreifende Kollaboration, die für ein umfassendes Sicherheitsmanagement in multiplen Cloud-Umgebungen erforderlich ist.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angesichts der rasanten Entwicklung der Cloud-Technologie könne man dabei leicht in Selbstzufriedenheit verfallen, warnt Fisher und rät: “Es ist essenziell, wachsam zu bleiben und proaktiv zu handeln. Sie sollten deshalb die Skills Ihrer Teams im Rahmen von Branchenkonferenzen, Schulungen und der aktiven Beteiligung an Experten-Communities kontinuierlich weiterentwickeln.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-einheitliche-response-strategie-einziehen"&gt;7. Einheitliche Response-Strategie einziehen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine einheitliche, bedrohungszentrische Detection-and-Response-Strategie die in allen Cloud-Umgebungen funktioniert, ist nach Auffassung von &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchem-boles/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mitchem Boles&lt;/a&gt;, Field CISO beim Plattformanbieter Intezer, ein wirksames Mittel, um selbst die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3840232/11-ruinose-ransomware-bedrohungen.html" target="_blank"&gt;raffiniertesten Angreifer&lt;/a&gt; abzuwehren: “Indem sie Warnmeldungen und Verhaltensmuster von AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform und anderen Anbietern in einem zentralisierten System korrelieren, können sich Sicherheitsteams auf echte Bedrohungen fokussieren, statt von Warnmeldungen erschlagen zu werden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So ermögliche dieser Ansatz den Security-Teams, schneller zu reagieren und parallel den manuellen Aufwand für die Triage in komplexen Umgebungen reduzieren, hält Boles fest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-cloud-zugriff-kontrollieren"&gt;8. Cloud-Zugriff kontrollieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geht es nach &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaymesdavis/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jaymes David&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Technology Evangelist beim Digital-Workplace-Anbieter Kasm Technologies, sollte Ihr Fokus vor allem darauf liegen, die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492897/attack-surface-management-losungen-9-tools-um-ihre-angriffsflache-zu-managen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Angriffsfläche&lt;/a&gt; Ihrer Multicloud-Umgebung zu reduzieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Beschränken Sie den Zugriff auf Cloud-Ressourcen durch kurzlebige, isolierte Sitzungen. Das minimiert die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass sich Malware im System halten kann oder sich jemand unbefugt Zugang verschafft. Sitzungsaufzeichnungen, SIEM-Integration, DLP oder Wasserzeichen tragen zu einem starken Sicherheitskonzept bei, das nachverfolgbar, durchsetzbar und überprüfbar ist”, so der Evangelist.

      <title>JPMorgan, Citi, Morgan Stanley assess fallout from SitusAMC data breach</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095182/jpmorgan-citi-morgan-stanley-assess-fallout-from-situsamc-data-breach.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley are among the major US banks assessing potential customer data exposure following a cyberattack on SitusAMC, a third-party vendor that processes residential mortgage data for hundreds of financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company discovered the breach on November 12 and confirmed on November 22 that attackers accessed information from its systems, &lt;a href="https://www.situsamc.com/databreach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to a company advisory&lt;/a&gt;. SitusAMC said the compromised data includes corporate information such as accounting records and legal agreements, and that “certain data relating to some of our clients’ customers may also have been impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The scope, nature and extent of such impact remains under investigation by the Company and its third-party advisors,” the advisory said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported Saturday that JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley were among institutions notified by SitusAMC about potential client data exposure, citing five people briefed on the incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When contacted by CSO, JPMorgan declined to comment on the breach. Citi and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fbi-says-no-operational-impact-reported"&gt;FBI says no operational impact reported&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FBI Director Kash Patel told The New York Times that the bureau is working with affected organizations to assess the breach. Kash said that the FBI has not yet found any operational impact on banking services and is continuing to investigate the matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SitusAMC, which employs approximately 5,000 people and is owned by several private equity firms, provides loan origination, servicing, and regulatory compliance services to major lenders. The company’s role in mortgage processing involves handling extensive personal information, including Social Security numbers, financial account details, and employment records, as found on loan applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company said that the incident is now contained and services remain fully operational. No encrypting malware was involved, indicating threat actors focused on data exfiltration rather than ransomware deployment, according to the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scope of the breach remains under investigation. SitusAMC said it implemented several security measures following the incident, including credential resets, disabling remote access tools, updating firewall rules, and enhancing security settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="third-party-breaches-accelerating"&gt;Third-party breaches accelerating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SitusAMC incident is part of a broader trend of increasing cyberattacks targeting third-party vendors in the financial services sector. Third parties accounted for 30% of data breaches in 2024, a 15% increase from 2023, according to Venminder’s State of Third-Party Risk Management 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.venminder.com/blog/third-party-cybersecurity-risks-in-financial-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. The survey found 49% of organizations experienced third-party cybersecurity incidents last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The financial services sector has seen particularly heavy vendor-related cyberattack activity. &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/cybersecurity-advisory-third-party-provider-risks"&gt;FINRA observed&lt;/a&gt; a large increase in incidents during the first half of 2024, with threat actors targeting vulnerabilities in system management tools and technology products used by third-party providers. Notable incidents in 2024 included data breaches at Microsoft, Snowflake, and Dropbox that had a widespread impact on financial services firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, the New York Department of Financial Services issued &lt;a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry-guidance/industry-letters/il20251021-guidance-managing-risks-third-party" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; emphasizing that regulated entities remain fully responsible for cybersecurity when outsourcing to service providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SEC also amended Regulation S-P in 2024 to require firms’ incident response programs to include written policies for overseeing service providers through due diligence and monitoring. The regulation requires firms to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies reasonably designed to require oversight of service providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FINRA has also reminded member firms of their supervisory obligations related to outsourcing to third-party vendors. The self-regulatory organization noted that firms have an obligation to establish and maintain a supervisory system for any activities or functions third-party vendors perform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="investigation-continues"&gt;Investigation continues&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has established a dedicated email for inquiries and said that it will provide updates to clients as the investigation progresses. The advisory did not specify how many institutions or customers may be affected or give a timeline for completing the forensic investigation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are in direct, regular contact with our clients about this matter,” SitusAMC said in the statement. “We remain focused on analyzing any potentially affected data and will provide updates directly to our clients as our investigation progresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
