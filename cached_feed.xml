      <title>Hidden API in Comet AI browser raises security red flags for enterprises</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4092995/hidden-api-in-comet-ai-browser-raises-security-red-flags-for-enterprises.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquareX has disclosed a previously undocumented API within the Comet AI browser that allows its embedded extensions to execute arbitrary commands and launch applications — capabilities mainstream browsers intentionally block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a disclosure shared with CSO ahead of its publication on Wednesday, Comet’s Analytics Extension contains a custom MCP API that bypasses the decade-old safeguards in mainstream browsers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The API can be triggered directly from perplexity.ai, creating a covert execution channel that attackers could exploit through familiar techniques such as compromised extensions, XSS, or phishing. The feature introduces a type of device access typically reserved for native apps, not browsers, SquareX added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say the discovery lands at a&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4078306/ai-browsers-can-be-abused-by-malicious-ai-sidebar-extensions-report-2.html"&gt; sensitive moment&lt;/a&gt; for AI browsers. John Grady, principal analyst at Omdia, said most organizations have already classified them conservatively. “Most organizations are treating them as unmanaged apps at this point in time,” he said. “It’s incredibly early, so very few, if any, organizations are adopting this as the default enterprise browser. And this finding will do nothing to change that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Embedded extensions have undocumented device access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SqaureX says it uncovered the MCP API while reviewing Comet’s embedded Analytics Extension, where the non-standard “chrome.perplexity” namespace suggested an addition to Chromium. Audrey Adeline from SquareX said the team identified the API directly in the extension code. “We were able to retrieve the MCP API in the Comet Analytics Extension source code.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that the exploitability of the feature is surprisingly high. “The technical bar for this exploit is extremely low: extension stomping, cross-site scripting, and basic network MitM attacks are more than enough.” In a demo shared along with the disclosure, a malicious extension spoofed as Comet’s Analytics Extension injected a script into the perplexity.ai page and ultimately used the Agentic Extension to invoke the MCP API, resulting in an on-device execution of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563017/wannacry-explained-a-perfect-ransomware-storm.html"&gt;WannaCry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquareX also points out that Comet hides both the Analytics and Agentic extensions from the browser’s extension dashboard, preventing users from disabling them even if a compromise is suspected. Due to a lack of documentation, Adeline warned that it is “possible that other embedded or 3rd party extensions also have access to the API, in the future if not today”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perplexity did not immediately respond to CSO’s request for comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="broader-warning-for-ai-browsers"&gt;Broader Warning for AI browsers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disclosure is likely to deepen enterprise hesitation around AI browser adoption. Grady noted that organizations will continue treating them as unsanctioned applications until they can fully assess the tradeoffs. “Security teams should ensure corporate policy is clear, and they have the tools to enforce that policy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquareX’s recommendation is rather blunt. AI browsers must disclose all system-level APIs, undergo independent security audits, and give users the ability to disable embedded extensions. Without that, they warn, the industry could normalize a class of browsers that quietly hold endpoint-level authority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, the MCP API is accessible by Comet’s embedded extensions by default, and there is no way to uninstall these extensions, so apart from preventing users from using Comet, the true fix can only come from Perplexity,” Adeline noted. “For extension stomping, device integrity measures can be put in place to prevent sideloading of extensions.” However, extension stomping is just one way the API can be exploited, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The nexus of risk and intelligence: How vulnerability-informed hunting uncovers what everything else misses</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4092087/the-nexus-of-risk-and-intelligence-how-vulnerability-informed-hunting-uncovers-what-everything-else-misses.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, I watched organizations treat vulnerability data like a compliance chore. It was something to scan, sort and patch against deadlines. Yet buried in those reports is a treasure map of sorts, where an attacker is likely to strike first. In my previous red team and incident responder roles, minus a credential leak or insider threat, every attack was perpetrated through a vulnerability. This perspective guided me in developing this strategy. Every CVE represents not just a weakness but an opportunity to understand behavior, exposure and intent. When my teams began connecting vulnerability management with threat hunting, we turned static lists into dynamic intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability-informed hunting is where risk management meets detection engineering. By using vulnerability data to guide hunts and fill gaps in visibility, we can expose ongoing compromise, prioritize detection work where it matters and continuously refine logging and monitoring. With every step in the process, previously loathed compliance audits turned into adversary-seeking missiles. For me, it has become the operational bridge between theory and practice. This is the nexus of risk and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vulnerabilities-as-a-lens-not-a-list"&gt;Vulnerabilities as a lens, not a list&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early in my career, vulnerability scans were treated as checklists. Systems were scanned, findings sorted by CVSS score and teams rushed to patch the critical ones. The result was tactical busy work with little operational insight. I learned that a better approach is to treat vulnerabilities as behavioral indicators, signs of where adversaries can or already do operate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we enriched vulnerability data with asset context such as business function, exposure level and criticality, it became a threat lens. For example, a remote code execution flaw on a public-facing application server tied to a customer portal was not just a critical CVE. It was a potential entry point for credential theft, lateral movement or data exfiltration. By prioritizing hunts based on this enriched view, our program shifted from a reactive patch cycle to a proactive defense posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This risk-centric mindset focuses effort where compromise would hurt most. It allows us to start with what is probable rather than what is merely possible. Instead of chasing every theoretical exploit, we trace real-world attack paths grounded in our own infrastructure and risk model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teams that view vulnerabilities through a contextual lens can anticipate attacker behavior. For instance, internet-exposed assets with outdated software versions are more likely to attract scanning and exploit attempts. Mapping these vulnerabilities to business impact clarifies not just what to patch but what to watch for. The more context we bring to vulnerability data, the greater its value as an operational signal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="turning-vulnerability-data-into-intelligence"&gt;Turning vulnerability data into intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once vulnerabilities are contextualized, they can be turned into actionable intelligence. Every significant CVE tells a stor­y — known exploit activity, actor interest, proof-of-concept code or links to &lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a&gt; techniques. This external intelligence gives us the who and how behind potential exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, when a privilege escalation vulnerability in Linux (CVE-2023-0386) began circulating, we monitored open-source intelligence and saw exploit repositories and chatter across dark web forums. Our SOC enriched its internal vulnerability data with that information, tagged affected assets and built targeted hunts for unusual setuid behavior or kernel module loading.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The correlation between internal vulnerability data and external threat intelligence is critical. Threat intelligence feeds and frameworks such as the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CISA KEV&lt;/a&gt; (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) and the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NVD&lt;/a&gt; provide insight into exploitation likelihood, attack prevalence and actor capabilities. Automated enrichment allows us to connect CVEs in our environment with live adversary tactics, rapidly surfacing the vulnerabilities that matter most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability data also helps forecast emerging attack trends. Tracking which CVEs are most discussed or weaponized lets us predict likely attack vectors weeks before broad exploitation occurs. By combining internal scan results with external telemetry, we effectively convert our vulnerability database into a customized threat feed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blend of vulnerability intelligence and threat intelligence allows for prioritization beyond CVSS scores. For example, two critical vulnerabilities might exist in our environment, but if only one is being actively exploited in the wild according to CISA KEV or open-source reporting, the decision on where to focus attention becomes clear. This approach aligns risk management with real-world adversary behavior and reduces noise for our SOC and detection teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-intel-to-hunt-detecting-the-exploitable"&gt;From intel to hunt: Detecting the exploitable&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once vulnerabilities are mapped to adversary behavior, they can fuel targeted hunts. The logic is simple — if a vulnerability exists, we hunt for traces of its exploitation or related activity. This grounds threat hunting in measurable risk instead of open-ended speculation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each vulnerability suggests specific attacker behaviors that should leave observable traces. For example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228):&lt;/strong&gt; Hunt for suspicious JNDI lookup strings, outbound LDAP or HTTP calls from Java processes or evidence of remote code execution activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473):&lt;/strong&gt; Look for anomalous w3wp.exe child processes, unexpected PowerShell activity or suspicious mailbox exports on Exchange servers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472):&lt;/strong&gt; Review domain controller logs for anomalous machine account password resets or NTLM authentication attempts from unusual hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These hunts serve two purposes: detection and validation. If activity is found, it is potential evidence of exploitation or at least attempted exploitation. If not, the hunt still provides insight into visibility gaps such as missing logs, incorrect parsing, absent telemetry or poor baselining.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective threat hunting based on vulnerability data requires close collaboration between vulnerability management, detection engineering and the SOC. My teams rely on timely access to scan results, asset inventories and business context to align our efforts. Detection engineers then use findings from hunts to refine log collection, develop new detection content and automate monitoring. The result is a collaborative loop that maximizes both human expertise and technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This process also aligns with frameworks like MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK and &lt;a href="https://d3fend.mitre.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;D3FEND&lt;/a&gt;. By tying each vulnerability to its relevant TTPs and mitigations, we can measure which behaviors are detectable today and which require new engineering. Vulnerability-driven hunts thus double as detection coverage assessments, allowing us to systematically improve both our technology and our processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="closing-the-gaps-detection-engineering-through-hunts"&gt;Closing the gaps: Detection engineering through hunts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability-informed hunts often reveal something more valuable than malicious activity — blind spots in telemetry and coverage. A hunt may show that certain telemetry sources are incomplete or unavailable. We might find kernel logs, application logs or DNS records are missing. These findings are gold for detection engineers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, hunting for Log4Shell activity once revealed to me that Java application logs were not being shipped to the SIEM and that some web servers lacked endpoint coverage. Each uncovered gap defines a concrete improvement — enable detailed process command-line logging, centralize application logs or deploy endpoint agents on neglected systems. By turning hunts into visibility audits, we built a living map of where detection coverage ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detection engineering then operationalizes these findings. A one-time hunt for exploitation patterns becomes a recurring detection. Over time, these detections mature into SIEM content, correlation rules or EDR alerts. The loop is continuous and self-improving:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerabilities reveal risk.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Intelligence maps that risk to adversary behavior.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Hunts validate detection capability and expose gaps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Detection engineering closes those gaps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Improvements in coverage inform the next cycle of hunting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outcome is measurable resilience. Instead of patching reactively or deploying arbitrary detections, our organization evolves based on real, observed weaknesses and strengthening efforts. The feedback from vulnerability-informed hunts ensures that the monitoring strategy keeps pace with both the evolving threat landscape and the actual conditions of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach also supports compliance and audit efforts by providing evidence of continuous improvement. Documentation of hunts, detection development and visibility improvements demonstrates that our security program is not only aware of its weaknesses but is actively addressing them through structured, intelligence-led operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="its-time-to-move-beyond-patch-and-forget"&gt;It’s time to move beyond patch-and-forget&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability-informed threat hunting merges risk management with intelligence-led defense. Traditional vulnerability management stops at patching, but this approach goes further. By transforming vulnerability data into an operational weapon and focusing on which weaknesses matter most, we gain a detection posture that continuously improves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think you’ll agree, this shift makes sense in theory. It has proven itself countless times in my reality. By moving beyond the patch-and-forget mindset and using vulnerability data to drive threat hunting, I have seen teams uncover active threats, close dangerous blind spots and continuously improve both detection and response. Each time we approached vulnerability management as a source of intelligence, rather than just a checklist, our defenses became stronger and our ability to anticipate adversaries improved. The difference is tangible — this is not just a strategy; it’s a mindset that uncovers what everything else misses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>End of the game for cybercrime infrastructure: 1025 servers taken down</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down</link>
      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

      <title>Iranian APT hacks helped direct missile strikes in Israel and the Red Sea</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093375/iranian-apt-hacks-helped-direct-missile-strikes-in-israel-and-the-red-sea.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber-related activities of two Iran-linked threat actors played key roles in subsequent high-profile missile strikes, according to Amazon’s Threat Intel team, which sees the incidents as indicative of increased use of cyber operations in support of kinetic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We believe that cyber-enabled kinetic targeting will become increasingly common across multiple adversaries,” CJ Moses, CISO of Amazon Integrated Security, wrote in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/new-amazon-threat-intelligence-findings-nation-state-actors-bridging-cyber-and-kinetic-warfare/"&gt;a blog post documenting the two incidents&lt;/a&gt;. “Nation-state actors are recognizing the force multiplier effect of combining digital reconnaissance with physical attacks. This trend represents a fundamental evolution in warfare, where the traditional boundaries between cyber and kinetic operations are dissolving.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While not a new development in the age of hybrid warfare, the incidents documented by Amazon shed new light on how missile strikes in the Red Sea and Israel were directly supported by cyber espionage efforts to gather target reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="imperial-kitten-hacks-into-maritime-ship-tracking-system"&gt;Imperial Kitten hacks into maritime ship tracking system&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the kinetic attacks Amazon was able to correlate to cyber operations occurred in early February 2024 when Houthi rebels launched missiles at a commercial vessel in the Red Sea as part of a campaign to disrupt shipping through the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strike was unsuccessful, with US Central Command reporting on February 1 that two Houthi-fired missiles impacted the water without hitting the ship, resulting in no injuries or damage reported. However, Amazon’s threat intelligence data now shows that an APT group known as Imperial Kitten searched Automatic Identification System (AIS) location data for that exact same vessel days prior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Active since at least 2017, Imperial Kitten, also known as Tortoiseshell or TA456, is a threat actor believed to be part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the years the group has targeted the maritime industry, including shipbuilding as well as shipping logistics organizations, alongside other industries such as defense, technology, telecommunications, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Amazon, the group compromised a vessel’s AIS platform in December 2021 and followed up with attacks in 2022 on additional vessel systems, including on-board CCTV cameras aboard one ship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AIS is an automatic tracking system that uses VHF radio to exchange information about a ship’s identification, position, speed, and course with shore stations as well as other vessels. Gaining access to a ship’s AIS platform would allow hackers to search for other vessels as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the Houthis are backed by Iran and a known APT linked to the Iranian government was seen searching AIS data for a specific vessel days before it was targeted in a Houthi-launched missile attack, Amazon believes the correlation is “unmistakable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This case demonstrates how cyber operations can provide adversaries with the precise intelligence needed to conduct targeted physical attacks against maritime infrastructure — a critical component of global commerce and military logistics,” Amazon’s Moses said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="muddywater-uses-hacked-cctv-cameras-to-help-guide-missiles"&gt;MuddyWater uses hacked CCTV cameras to help guide missiles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazon also found supporting threat intel evidence for another Iran-linked incident involving cyber espionage and missile strikes that has received some official confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the US strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites in June, Iran retaliated by launching a barrage of missiles against Israel, targeting cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A former Israeli cybersecurity official claimed that Iranian operatives were trying to access private surveillance cameras to assess the impact of their strikes and improve their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Israel’s National Cyber Directorate also confirmed to Bloomberg at around the same time that CCTV systems were increasingly targeted by Iranian hackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s data shows that MuddyWater, a threat group linked to an Iranian company acting as a front for Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), accessed a compromised server containing live CCTV streams from Jerusalem days before a widespread Iranian missile attack against the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access to the compromised CCTV server was achieved via server infrastructure that MuddyWater had set up in May for its cyber operations, showing a direct link to the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The targeting of CCTV cameras for intelligence gathering in support of military operations is not unique to Iran. In May 2024, intelligence agencies from the US and multiple NATO countries warned in &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/21/2003719846/-1/-1/0/CSA_RUSSIAN_GRU_TARGET_LOGISTICS.PDF"&gt;a joint advisory&lt;/a&gt; that Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, hacked into cameras at key locations, such as near border crossings, military installations, and rail stations, in Ukraine and neighboring countries. The goal was to track the movement of materials into Ukraine as part of aid shipments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the cybersecurity community, this research serves as both a warning and a call to action,” Amazon’s Moses said. “Defenders must adapt their strategies to address threats that span both digital and physical domains. Organizations that historically believed they weren’t of interest to threat actors could now be targeted for tactical intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazon suggests organizations should expand their threat modeling to consider how their compromised IT systems could be used to support physical attacks, especially the operators of critical infrastructure, maritime systems, urban surveillance networks, and other data sources that could be used to aid targeting in kinetic operations. The company has coined the term “cyber-enabled kinetic targeting” for cyber operations whose goal is to facilitate and enhance kinetic military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bot w Skull 16z9 v2 " class="wp-image-4084812" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lerbank-bbk22_shutterstock_2367007649_16z9.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;KI-Risiken zu bewerten und zu quantifizieren, ist in der GenAI-Ära unerlässlich.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Lerbank-bbk22 | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie jede Technologie birgt auch künstliche Intelligenz (KI) nicht nur Vorteile. Insbesondere seit dem Aufkommen von Generative AI (&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2821922/was-ist-generative-ai.html" target="_blank" title="GenAI"&gt;GenAI&lt;/a&gt;) und der explosionsartigen Verbreitung entsprechender Tools und Lösungen ist es für Unternehmen wichtiger denn je, die Risiken &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492643/generative-aieine-neue-herausforderung-fur-den-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen"&gt;in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen&lt;/a&gt;. Entsprechend steht das Thema GenAI bei Rechts-, Compliance- und Datenschutzverantwortlichen &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-12-13-gartner-says-legal-compliance-and-privacy-leaders-rank-rapid-generative-ai-adoption-their-top-issue-in-the-next-two-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="einer Gartner-Umfrage"&gt;einer Gartner-Umfrage&lt;/a&gt; zufolge in den nächsten zwei Jahren ganz oben auf der Agenda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um KI-Risiken entgegenzuwirken, neue Bedrohungen zu minimieren sowie Compliance und Datenschutz zu gewährleisten, müssen Anwenderunternehmen ihr KI-Engagement gründlich bewerten, Risiken abwägen und Richtlinien sowie Strategien &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492417/ki-vs-mensch-der-aufstieg-des-ai-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="definieren"&gt;definieren&lt;/a&gt;. Die Bewertungsstrategien unterscheiden sich dabei je nach Art der eingesetzten KI-Lösung. Ganz allgemein lassen sich die Risiken in Zusammenhang mit der Technologie in drei Kategorien einteilen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;interne KI-Projekte,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KI-Lösungen von Drittanbietern sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;schadhafter KI-Einsatz durch Bedrohungsakteure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden nehmen wir die einzelnen Bereiche ausführlich unter die Lupe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="interne-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Interne KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Risiken bewerten zu können, müssen Unternehmen im ersten Schritt wissen, wie künstliche Intelligenz intern eingesetzt wird. Um das zu bewerkstelligen, bieten sich zwei Möglichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Softwareunternehmen Abbyy bewertet und quantifiziert die Performance seiner KI-Modelle schon seit einigen Jahren. Dafür verwendet das Unternehmen Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement – unter anderem das &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="ISO Risk Management Framework"&gt;ISO Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Spezielle Risikomanagement-Frameworks für künstliche Intelligenz werden derzeit erarbeitet – sowohl &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in den USA"&gt;in den USA&lt;/a&gt; als auch &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/de/policies/regulatory-framework-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in Europa"&gt;in Europa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warum Abbyy für seine internen GenAI-Projekte in erster Linie auf ältere Frameworks setzt, erklärt Andrew Pery, AI Ethics Evangelist beim KI-Softwarespezialisten, folgendermaßen: “Diese Frameworks sind noch sehr rudimentär. Es ist noch zu früh, sie zum Einsatz zu bringen. Unser Kernprodukt extrahiert Daten und Inhalte aus Dokumenten und wir haben spezifische Genauigkeitsziele für unsere traditionellen KI-Modelle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut einer &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/state-of-ai-report-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wiz-Untersuchung"&gt;Wiz-Untersuchung&lt;/a&gt; von 150.000 Public-Cloud-Accounts kommen in 70 Prozent der Cloud-Umgebungen inzwischen Generative-AI-Dienste zum Einsatz. Die beliebteste KI-Plattform ist dabei mit 53 Prozent die von OpenAI. Dicht gefolgt von Hugging Face und anderen Open-Source-Projekten. Diese Plattformen zu nutzen, birgt für Unternehmen diverse Risiken, beispielsweise mit Blick darauf, dass eingegebene Daten für das KI-Modelltraining verwendet werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein umfassender Überblick darüber, welche KI-Lösungen wo zum Einsatz kommen, ist deshalb unerlässlich. Laut Priya Iragavarapu, VP of Technology Services bei der Unternehmensberatung AArete, erfordert das sowohl einen Top-Down- als auch einen Bottom-Up-Ansatz: “Unternehmensentscheider sollten Prozesse, bei denen KI beteiligt ist, überprüfen und mit dem KI-Governance-Team &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496105/governance-als-losung-genai-zwischen-akzeptanz-und-verbot.html" target="_blank" title="diskutieren"&gt;diskutieren&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn die Führungskräfte nicht wissen, welche KI wo verwendet wird, kommt der Bottom-up-Ansatz ins Spiel: Alle Endpunkte im Unternehmen werden getrackt, um die Systeme und Benutzer zu finden, die auf KI-Anwendungen zugreifen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das stelle keine perfekte Lösung dar, gibt die Beraterin zu: “Es gibt immer noch Dinge, die unter den Tisch fallen. Aber an dieser Stelle kommt der Aspekt einer gründlichen Schulung beziehungsweise Weiterbildung ins Spiel, um Mitarbeiter vor selbstverschuldeten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3577944/diese-unternehmen-hats-schon-erwischt.html" target="_blank" title="Dummheiten"&gt;Dummheiten&lt;/a&gt; zu bewahren.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Eigene AI Deployment Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen sollten auch ein Framework dafür aufsetzen, wie KI-Modelle im Sinne ihrer jeweiligen Compliance-Umgebung und Risikotoleranz eingesetzt werden. So könnten etwa einige Anwendungsfälle erfordern, dass sämtliche KI-Outputs manuell überprüft werden müssen. “Es gibt mehrere Risikodimensionen, die für generative KI relevant sind”, erklärt Iragavarapu. “Wie viele Menschen sind davon betroffen? Wie groß ist der Impact?” AArete arbeitet mit einigen Unternehmen zusammen, um sie dabei zu unterstützen, diese Risiken zu messen. Für einige Branchen existieren auch bereits erste Generative-AI-Risiko-Benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Bereich, auf den sich jetzt diverse Beratungsunternehmen konzentrieren – Ernst &amp;amp; Young zum Beispiel hat einen “&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ai/platform/our-approach" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Confidence Index"&gt;AI Confidence Index&lt;/a&gt;” entwickelt. Kapish Vanvaria, Risk Markets Leader bei EY Americas, erklärt, was es damit auf sich hat: “Unser Vertrauensindex basiert auf fünf Kriterien – Datenschutz und Sicherheit, Bias und Fairness, Verlässlichkeit, Transparenz und Erklärbarkeit und schließlich die Verantwortlichkeit. Das ist die eine Achse des Indexes. Die andere umfasst Compliance und ethische Grundsätze. So lässt sich eine Heatmap der verschiedenen Prozesse erstellen und eine gewichtete Bewertungsmethode auf jeden einzelnen anwenden.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich Recht und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496124/cloud-security-journey-wie-compliance-bei-accenture-geht.html" target="_blank" title="Compliance"&gt;Compliance&lt;/a&gt; seien diese Berechnungen relativ einfach, weil sie auf Scoring-Werten basierten. In anderen gebe es hingegen mehr Ermessensspielraum, so der EY-Entscheider: “Ein Unternehmen könnte beispielsweise den Reifegrad anhand von Faktoren wie einer Richtlinie zur akzeptablen KI-Nutzung bewerten. Sie können numerische Punktzahlen anwenden, um die Grundlinien zu messen, und wenn sich das Ziel verändert entsprechende Änderungen vornehmen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="drittanbieter-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Drittanbieter-KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsprobleme in Zusammenhang mit Drittanbieter-Services sind &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492170/third-party-risk-management-5-wege-mit-drittanbietern-unterzugehen.html" target="_blank" title="nicht neu"&gt;nicht neu&lt;/a&gt;. Potenziell könnte jeder Anbieter – egal, ob es um E-Mail-, Marketing- oder Daten-Services geht – Zugriff auf sensible Daten haben und diese unter Umständen sogar an seine jeweiligen Partner weitergeben. Risiken dieser Art zu minimieren, war schon vor Generative AI eine Herausforderung für Unternehmen – jetzt haben die Sicherheitsentscheider und ihre Teams gar keine andere Wahl mehr, als &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494219/chatgpt-und-co-was-cisos-beim-einsatz-von-genai-beachten-sollten.html" target="_blank" title="wachsam zu sein"&gt;wachsam zu sein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schließlich könnten Tools, die bislang nicht als Sicherheitsrisiko galten, etwa für die Bildbearbeitung, inzwischen über GenAI-Funktionalitäten verfügen – die hochgeladenen Informationen also bei einer KI landen. Um das zu verhindern, müssen in erster Linie sämtliche Verträge und Nutzungsbedingungen genau studiert und im Auge behalten werden. Darüber hinaus kann ein dediziertes Risikomanagement-Team für Drittanbieter dazu beitragen, Risiken zu minimieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Notch, CISO beim Security-Anbieter Expel, hat noch einen Tipp auf Lager, wenn es darum geht, die Zeichen am Horizont zu deuten: “Wenn ein Anbieter intern neue KI-Funktionen entwickelt, kann eine Änderung seiner Datenschutzrichtlinie ein erster Hinweis darauf sein. Bleiben Sie wachsam!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesem Zusammenhang entfaltet auch die europäische Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) positive Wirkung. Sie verpflichtet Anbieter dazu, offenzulegen, wenn sie mit Subunternehmern zusammenarbeiten. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="externe-ki-bedrohungen-bewerten"&gt;Externe KI-Bedrohungen bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative KI wird längst auch zu unlauteren Zwecken genutzt, etwa um &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495991/google-prognose-2024-genai-verstarkt-phishing-kampagnen.html" target="_blank" title="(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren"&gt;(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren&lt;/a&gt;. Das stellt die Sicherheitsteams in Unternehmen zunehmend vor Probleme, wie CISO Notch konstatiert: “Jede Organisation will sich vor Business E-Mail Compromise schützen. Allerdings sind die Indikatoren dafür, dass es sich um eine nicht koschere E-Mail handelt, sowohl für Menschen als auch für Maschinen immer schwieriger zu erkennen. Künstliche Intelligenz ist in der Lage, E-Mails und Webseiten nahezu perfekt zu fälschen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perys Arbeitgeber Abbyy arbeitet deswegen gezielt mit Sicherheitsanbietern zusammen, die sich auf GenAI-Bedrohungen spezialisiert haben. Dennoch sind die KI-Risiken schwer zu quantifizieren. An dieser Stelle sollen künftig neue Frameworks Abhilfe schaffen – etwa die vom Cybersecurity-Experten Daniel Miessler 2023 veröffentlichte “&lt;a href="https://danielmiessler.com/p/the-ai-attack-surface-map-v1-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Attack Surface Map"&gt;AI Attack Surface Map&lt;/a&gt;“. Sasa Zdjelar, Chief Trust Officer beim Supply-Chain-Spezialisten ReversingLabs, rechnet damit, dass demnächst auch größere Organisationen nachziehen: “CISA, NIST, die Cloud Security Alliance, ENISA und andere werden spezielle Task Forces bilden, die sich mit diesen neuen Bedrohungen befassen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bis es soweit ist, können Unternehmen prüfen, wie gut sie die Grundlagen beherrschen. Dazu gehört beispielsweise, zu überprüfen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle Endpunkte geschützt sind;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle User Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung nutzen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie gut die Mitarbeiter Phishing-Versuche erkennen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie groß der Rückstand in Sachen Patching ist;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;zu welchem Grad &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank" title="Zero-Trust-Prinzipien"&gt;Zero-Trust-Prinzipien&lt;/a&gt; die IT-Umgebung abdecken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese grundlegenden Hygienemaßnahmen können leicht unter den Tisch fallen, wenn neue Bedrohungen auftauchen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus können Firmen auch hinsichtlich neuer und aufkeimender Threats tätig werden, wie Sean Loveland, COO vom Sicherheitsanbieter Resecurity, nahelegt: “Offensive Cyber Threat Intelligence und KI-spezifisches Threat Monitoring können Informationen über neue Angriffsmethoden und Schwachstellen liefern sowie darüber, wie diese monetarisiert werden. Es gibt zum Beispiel ein Produkt namens ‘FraudGPT’, das über das Dark Web und Telegram vertrieben wird.” Dass kriminelle Hacker KI-Tools inzwischen&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492536/chatgpt-wie-cybergangster-generative-ai-nutzen.html" target="_blank" title=" in erheblichem Umfang nutzen"&gt; in erheblichem Umfang nutzen&lt;/a&gt;, kann auch Greg Stewart, Vice President Artificial Intelligence bei SentinelOne, bestätigen: “Wir beobachten eine starke Zunahme von adaptiver und polymorpher Malware, die sich autonom verbreitet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Davon abgesehen ist GenAI jedoch auch in der Lage, das Angriffsvolumen drastisch zu steigern. Das Weltwirtschaftsforum identifiziert in seinem “&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Global Risks Report 2024"&gt;Global Risks Report&lt;/a&gt;” ein weiteres, erhebliches Risiko für Unternehmen: KI-generierte Fehl- und Desinformationen. Schließlich können sich entsprechende Fake News schnell drastisch auf den Aktienkurs eines Unternehmens auswirken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="risikobehaftete-aussichten"&gt;Risikobehaftete Aussichten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unternehmen müssen sich darauf konzentrieren, einen ganzheitlichen Plan zu erstellen, um den Stand der generativen KI in ihrem Unternehmen zu bewerten”, hält Paul Silverglate, Technology Leader bei Deloitte USA, fest. Er ergänzt: “Sie müssen zeigen, dass es für das Unternehmen wichtig ist, es richtig zu machen und darauf vorbereitet zu sein, schnell zu reagieren und Abhilfe zu schaffen, falls etwas passiert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie wahrscheinlich es ist, dass das genau so und zeitnah passiert, ist mit Blick auf eine &lt;a href="https://riskonnect.com/reports/new-generation-of-risk-ahead-of-the-curve-or-behind-the-pack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Riskonnect-Survey"&gt;Riskonnect-Survey&lt;/a&gt; unter 300 Risiko- und Compliance-Entscheidern fraglich:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;93 Prozent der Unternehmen rechnen mit erheblichen Bedrohungen im Zusammenhang mit generativer KI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennoch geben nur 17 Prozent der Teilnehmer an, das gesamte Unternehmen in Bezug auf GenAI-Risiken geschult oder informiert zu haben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lediglich neun Prozent sind nach eigenen Angaben darauf vorbereitet, diese Risiken zu managen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine ähnlich gelagerte ISACA-Umfrage unter mehr als 2.300 Fachleuten aus den Bereichen Audit, Risiko, Sicherheit, Datenschutz und IT-Governance kommt darüber hinaus zum Ergebnis, dass lediglich zehn Prozent der Befragten über eine umfassende &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494657/windows-sicherheit-meets-generative-ai-sind-ihre-richtlinien-schon-ki-ready.html" target="_blank" title="Generative-AI-Richtlinie"&gt;Generative-AI-Richtlinie&lt;/a&gt; verfügen. Noch schlimmer: Mehr als ein Viertel der Befragten plant auch nicht, eine solche zu entwickeln. Gravierende Fehler, wie Silvergate erklärt: “Trust ist &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495889/verbesserungswurdige-compliance-masnahmen-generative-ai-konnte-das-vertrauen-der-kunden-untergraben.html" target="_blank" title="der heilige Gral"&gt;der heilige Gral&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn Sie das Vertrauen ihrer Kunden verlieren, wird es sehr schwer zurückzugewinnen sein.” (fm)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selling to the CISO: An open letter to the cybersecurity industry</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089738/selling-to-the-ciso-an-open-letter-to-the-cybersecurity-industry.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity market has lost its mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It seems like every week a new vendor appears, investors throw money at half-baked ideas, and CISOs get buried in pitches for products that won’t stop the next breach. The noise keeps getting louder while the fundamentals stay ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these products don’t even look impressive in a demo. I sit through presentations and wonder why they exist. They promise to “redefine security” but can’t even explain what problem they’re solving. They’re built for funding rounds, not production. They’re answers to questions nobody asked. Meanwhile, the same core vulnerabilities keep wrecking companies year after year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vendors think they’re selling technology. They’re not. They’re trying to sell confidence to people whose &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4016334/has-ciso-become-the-least-desirable-role-in-business.html"&gt;jobs depend on managing the impossible&lt;/a&gt;. As a CISO, I buy because I’m trying to reduce the odds that something catastrophic happens on my watch. Every decision is a gamble. There is no “safe” option in this field. I buy to reduce personal and organizational risk, knowing there’s no such thing as perfect protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is not a puzzle you solve. It’s a game you play — and it never ends. You make the best moves you can, knowing you’ll never win. Even if I somehow patched every system and closed every gap, the cost of perfection would cripple the company. We could make ourselves completely secure tomorrow if we were willing to stop shipping product, serving customers, and generating revenue. But that isn’t security anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The job is to keep the company running without letting it burn down. That means I don’t just care about uptime. I care about not having the breach that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3846318/6-hard-earned-tips-for-leading-through-a-cyberattack-from-csos-whove-been-there.html"&gt;defines the next year of my life&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about balance. Too much risk and you’re in the headlines. Too much control and you kill innovation. Every day in this role is a negotiation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I buy very selectively. I buy what fits the roadmap, what measurably reduces risk, what integrates cleanly, and what my team can sustain. I buy visibility because you can’t defend what you can’t see. I buy identity because access is where real control lives. I buy automation that makes people faster, not dumber. And I buy tools that make secure-by-design real, not theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What I don’t buy is hype. I don’t buy tools that overlap with three others. I don’t buy anything that looks good in a slide deck but fails in the real world. I don’t buy complexity that makes the team’s job harder. And I don’t buy from anyone who can’t explain in clear, human language what problem they’re solving and how it actually reduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="its-all-about-the-fundamentals"&gt;It’s all about the fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The truth is that most organizations don’t need more tools. They need to get the fundamentals right. If you can patch consistently, maintain good access controls, and segment your networks so you aren’t running flat, you’re ahead of most of the market — no shiny tools required. Strong patching alone will eliminate most of the attack surface that vendors keep promising to “detect.” Network segmentation prevents lateral movement. Access control limits blast radius. These aren’t new ideas. They’re old, proven, and neglected because they don’t sound exciting enough for investors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s the problem. The industry has stopped rewarding what works. It rewards what sells. Venture capital keeps throwing money at “AI-powered” and “autonomous” everything while the basics rot. Vendors chase hype because hype gets funding. CISOs buy hype because we’re desperate for something that will finally make the pain stop. The cycle feeds itself. Everyone’s rational, but the result is insane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can’t blame vendors alone. We created the market they’re serving. We bought into the illusion that innovation equals progress. We ignored the fundamentals because they’re hard and unglamorous. We filled our environments with products we couldn’t fully use and called it maturity. We built complexity and called it strategy. Then we act shocked when the same root causes keep taking us down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good security still starts with good IT. Always has. Always will. If you don’t know what you own, you can’t protect it. If you don’t patch it, it’s already compromised. If you give excessive access or run a flat network, you’re one compromised credential away from a crisis. The solutions exist. They’re just not exciting. They require patience, process, and persistence, which are the three things this industry avoids because they don’t photograph well at RSA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="looking-for-reliability-not-revolution"&gt;Looking for reliability, not revolution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m not anti-technology. I rely on it. But I buy it with purpose. I buy tools that make us better at the basics, that help enforce discipline, and that reduce human error. I buy solutions that simplify, not complicate. And I buy from vendors who tell me the truth, even when it’s inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good vendors understand this. They know they’re not selling revolution. They’re selling reliability. They show up prepared. They understand my business, they know where their solution fits, and they’re honest about what it can and can’t do. They know I’m not looking for magic. I’m looking for help managing a problem that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investors need to take responsibility, too. Stop funding vaporware. Stop chasing the next acronym. Fund the boring but critical work: visibility, identity, secure configuration, developer enablement, and IT hygiene. That’s what actually keeps companies out of the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And CISOs, we have to stop pretending we’re victims in this. We’re not. We built this market with our buying habits. We rewarded noise. We chased innovation that didn’t align with our maturity. If we want the industry to change, we have to change how we spend. Buy less. Buy smarter. Invest in people, process, and architecture before you buy another platform. If you can’t patch, if you can’t control access, if your network is still flat, you don’t need another tool. You need discipline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security is not a tech problem. It’s an execution problem. And until we fix that, no amount of funding, AI, or new categories will save us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep buying what matters. I’ll buy what reduces real risk and strengthens the foundation. I’ll buy what makes us harder to breach and easier to recover. But everything else, the noise, the hype, the endless stream of tools that don’t fix the real issues, can stay on the shelf (or in your PowerPoint slides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>3 ways CISOs can win over their boards this budget season</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093058/3-ways-cisos-can-win-over-their-boards-this-budget-season.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the year comes to a close, CISOs are already deep into building next year’s cybersecurity budget. That’s a difficult task in itself — yet the most challenging part of the process is getting the board’s approval. CISOs know all too well that getting a cybersecurity budget approved can be like trying to explain AP English to a dog: you’re just speaking different languages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern CISOs are charged with protecting their organization from rapidly evolving threats while cybersecurity budgets are shrinking or getting redistributed. Boards still tend to see cybersecurity as a cost center, not something that can increase efficiency within their business. CISOs know the truth, but they need to figure out how to communicate the value of cybersecurity in a language their board can understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are three tips to win over your board this budgeting season. Done correctly, you’ll have a better chance of securing your budget and making your organization more resilient in a fast-moving threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-1-quantify-risk"&gt;Tip 1: Quantify risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first step in building a defensible budget is putting numbers on the risks you’re trying to control. As a CISO, you immediately understand that your organization needs things like enhanced endpoint detection, a zero-trust architecture and a proper security operations center, but when you bring those things up in the budget meeting, the board’s eyes glaze over. It’s not that they are dismissing cybersecurity — they just don’t understand how these technical investments connect to the business outcomes they care about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should use financial terms to quantify your organization’s value at risk. Boards are more likely to accept your budget if they can understand the financial implications of a breach. Of course, this can be a difficult task if you haven’t experienced a breach before. You can start to understand your risk surface by researching your industry’s most common threats and breaches, consulting threat intelligence sources and interrogating your vendors’ cybersecurity postures to understand your third-party risk. You can also gather probability data on a breach through industry reports, government statistics and historical internal incident data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the most accurate and influential approach is to survey your own experts and stakeholders, including them in the quantification process. You can find tools to do this manually or automatically. Using either approach, you can calculate the overall business impact of your risk, including direct financial losses, business interruptions and long-term business and reputation effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an example of what this looks like in practice, take the recent &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/21/what-we-know-about-the-cyberattack-that-hit-major-european-airports.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Collins Aerospace breach&lt;/a&gt;, which caused heavy disruption and flight cancellations at multiple European airports. Not only were there direct financial losses for affected organizations, but there were also opportunity costs and lost efficiencies: increased engineering hours to get systems back online, pen and paper solutions on the ground to replace automated tasks, and overworked airport staff. Use these atomic, costly events to have the conversation with your CFO on modeling financial impact, imagining if your organization had been affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a dismal scenario for most organizations, but one that your board should understand the full implications of. When quantifying the risks to your board, you should be prepared to explain the impacts of a worst-case scenario, best-case scenario and most-likely scenario — all in terms of financial losses. Quantifying the full scope of the cascading effects of a breach will help non-technical executives understand the investment required to make your organization resilient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-2-go-beyond-compliance-standards"&gt;Tip 2: Go beyond compliance standards&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that compliance and regulations drive &lt;a href="https://www.hitchpartners.com/ciso-security-leadership-survey-results-25" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 80% of CISOs’ budget justifications&lt;/a&gt;. Industry standards like HIPAA and SOC2 can offer a guiding framework for a program, but with evolving threats from AI, the rise of quantum computing and increasingly complex third-party risk, CISOs need to think of the threats that compliance doesn’t necessarily mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can, aim for 10% or more of your budget to be allocated to non-compliance risks for a 3-5-year horizon. These double-digit percentages are aspirational; &lt;a href="https://www.iansresearch.com/resources/ians-security-budget-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the average CISO has a 3% discretionary budget&lt;/a&gt;. This budget does not have to be all net-new spend. For example, generative AI risks are top of mind for CISOs and boards, but dedicated, off-the-shelf tooling is in its very early stages. Existing budget line items, such as Data Security Posture Management, SASE and GRC analyst hours, can decrease risk from threats to generative AI workloads and tooling. Increased investment in these technologies and processes, alongside new ones, builds a solid foundation for your company to efficiently leverage Generative AI on a medium-term horizon and &lt;em&gt;limit &lt;/em&gt;net new spending on point solutions. These investments lay the groundwork for your company to scale securely ahead of your competitors, rather than jumping into &lt;a href="https://cyberresilience.com/threatonomics/how-to-avoid-ai-fomo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI FOMO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your board wants to know that you are thinking about the emerging risks and how to address them in your budget proactively. You may not have all of the data on a given risk, but you should still acknowledge it and help the board understand the likelihood of it impacting your organization. As the threat landscape evolves, so should your strategies for making your organization resilient to those risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-3-know-thy-board"&gt;Tip 3: Know thy board&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of winning over your board has to do with knowing what kind of persuasion tactics drive their decision-making. Boards are getting smarter on cybersecurity; a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nacdonline.org/all-governance/governance-resources/governance-surveys/surveys-benchmarking/2025-public-company-board-practices--oversight-survey/2025-board-practices-oversight-cybersecurity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NACD survey&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 80% of boards’ cybersecurity knowledge has improved. Another survey found &lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/board-matters/cyber-disclosure-trends" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85%&lt;/a&gt; of companies reported that they either have or are looking for a board member with cybersecurity expertise. Now that boards have a better awareness of the importance of cybersecurity, it’s your turn to meet them halfway and understand what they value from a business perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some boards are laser-focused on financial metrics and will only look at the dollars and cents of the budget. In that case, it’s essential to communicate in financial terms; they’ll want concrete examples of what the organization stands to lose from the cost of breach-related business interruption. This quantification does more than just justify your budget; it creates a bridge between your security team and business imperatives. Other boards may be more motivated by storytelling. In that case, painting a step-by-step picture of what an attack could look like and the corresponding impacts that go along with it will be most compelling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both instances, the budget and conversation defending it should speak the same language as your specific board. Importantly, that level of insight into what the board values can only come from consistent check-ins throughout the year. You should strive to build a relationship, so you aren’t simply a checkbox for the board come budgeting season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should bring rigor, clarity and business alignment to security investment decisions. If you can quantify the risks for your board, accounting for emerging risks and understand what they value the most, you’ll better your odds to win over your board this fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sneaky2FA phishing tool adds ability to insert legit-looking URLs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094165/sneaky2fa-phishing-tool-adds-ability-to-insert-legit-looking-urls.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of multi-factor authentication (MFA), threat actors have been finding ways to get around what can be an effective defense against phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their latest move, those behind the Sneaky2FA phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kit have added browser-in-the-browser (BITB) functionality to help crooks design phishing pages that fool victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function allows the crook to embed a browser window on the victim’s desktop containing a phishing page that includes a URL address bar that can be customized by the attacker to look like a legitimate address to, for example, Microsoft online. BITB differs from attacker-in-the-middle (AITM) attacks, where the threat actor creates an embedded browser window that contains the actual phishing page. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Employees trained to look for suspicious URLs might even be fooled, because the internet address looks real. However,  the pop-up window, enabled through a reverse proxy, contains an iframe pointing to a malicious server that captures credentials and MFA codes entered by the unwitting victim. Then the attacker can steal the live session of the account being targeted, as well as user credentials, by logging in in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-warning-to-csos"&gt;A warning to CSOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report this week &lt;a href="https://pushsecurity.com/blog/analyzing-the-latest-sneaky2fa-phishing-page/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from researchers at Push Security &lt;/a&gt;describing the Sneaky2FA browser-in-the-browser capability is a warning to CSOs that they have to adapt their employee security awareness training as well as their defensive technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BITB tactics are spreading, says the report. It notes that Raccoon0365 was another PhaaS service that has utilized BITB functionality after announcing a ‘BITB mini-panel’ would be added to its offerings. In September, Cloudflare and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4058634/microsoft-and-cloudflare-execute-rugpull-on-massive-phishing-empire.html" target="_blank"&gt;dismantled that gang’s IT infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BITB has been known as a concept since 2022, notes David Shipley, head of Canadian-based security awareness training firm Beauceron Security. In fact, he added, it is increasingly used by advanced red teams in penetration tests to defeat security controls like MFA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It hasn’t been widely used because it hasn’t been needed to get the job done when it comes to compromising organizations,” he said. But as defenses improve, he’s seen use of this technique increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s dangerous, he said, is that phishing-as-a-service tools are making it easier for entry-level criminals to use these more advanced techniques. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is why I’ve always hated it when people use language like ‘phishing resistant,’ or even worse, ‘phishing proof’ solutions. Additional identity controls like MFA add more friction and resiliency, but can still be bypassed by clever attackers. That’s why it’s critical organizations have both robust technology security control as well as an aware community.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means CSOs and infosec leaders have to do more than just annual compliance-driven security training, Shipley said, instead motivating employees to keep an eye out for unusual things in messaging so they spot and stop phishing and other cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s where many organizations are struggling,” he said. “Not in instructing people or passing on knowledge, but in creating a security culture that motivates people to apply knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570795/how-to-hack-2fa.html" target="_blank"&gt;Related content: How MFA gets hacked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The addition of BITB, along with the improvement of detection evasion techniques, means that traditional security controls such as email gateways, web filters, and signature-based defenses will continue to be reliably bypassed, Push Security’s report says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-look-at-sneaky2fa"&gt;A look at Sneaky2FA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sneaky2FA operates through a full-featured bot on Telegram, says the report. Customers reportedly receive access to a licensed, obfuscated version of the source code and deploy it independently. This means they can customize it to their needs. On the other hand, the report notes, Sneaky2FA implementations can be reliably profiled and tracked due to the codebase similarities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sneaky2FA has been frequently seen using anti-analysis techniques to detect or disable browser developer tools so they can block attempts to analyze the page for malicious content, the report adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Defenders should note that the HTML and JavaScript of Sneaky2FA pages are heavily obfuscated to evade static detection and pattern-matching, the report says. This includes using tactics such as breaking up UI text with invisible tags, embedding background and interface elements as encoded images instead of text, and other changes that are invisible to the user, but make it hard for scanning tools to fingerprint the page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Campaigns are also known to use a ‘burn-and-replace’ tactic, hiding behind a fresh, long, randomized URL that lies dormant or serves harmless content until right before the attack, and then quickly vanishes. This is to defeat domain reputation or pattern-matching defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-game-of-cat-and-mouse"&gt;A game of cat and mouse&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-g-/"&gt;Dan Green&lt;/a&gt;, author of the Push Security report, told &lt;em&gt;CSO &lt;/em&gt;in an email that email isn’t the only way BITB attacks are spreading. In the past several months, his firm has seen LinkedIn Messenger and Google Search being used as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We would encourage security teams to re-evaluate how they approach phishing detection,” he said. “[Phishing] is becoming increasingly sophisticated, it’s no longer just an email problem, and the risks are significant. A compromised enterprise cloud account (for example, Microsoft or Google Workspace) is effectively the key to everything you access in the course of the modern workday. This isn’t just the direct access to your enterprise cloud suite, but the downstream application access via SSO (single sign-on) that can be hijacked by the attacker. Most breaches start with compromised identities today, compared with software exploits or malware execution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/author/roger-grimes"&gt;Roger Grimes&lt;/a&gt;, data driven defense CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4, noted that browser vendors have worked for decades trying to prevent malicious popup boxes from appearing because they are so tricky. However, he added, criminals keep on figuring out ways to bypass the protections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, he added, it is getting ever harder for criminals to create malicious popup boxes. Users still have a chance to see what is happening if they are aware, he said. “Sadly,” he said, “a large percentage of users don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educating users by providing information and examples of how browser pop-up attacks work is key, he said. In addition, CSOs should make sure browsers used by employees are as well configured as they can be to prevent these types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Browser vendors will respond and close the holes, but it’s always a reactive game of cat-and-mouse with the defenders always behind.” he said. “Pretty soon AI-enabled defense tools will do a better job at preventing them from happening at all. We just have to cover the gap for now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>So rechtfertigen Sie Ihre Security-Investitionen</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4051211/so-rechtfertigen-sie-ihre-security-investitionen.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Investitionen" class="wp-image-4051223" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2544942275.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lesen Sie, welche Aspekte entscheidend sind, um die Investitionen in die Cybersicherheit im Unternehmen zu rechtfertigen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Miha Creative – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In modernen Unternehmensumgebungen werden Investitionen in Sicherheitstechnologien nicht mehr nur anhand ihres technischen Reifegrades beurteilt. Die Finanzierung hängt vermehrt davon ab, inwieweit sich damit Umsatz generieren lässt, Risiken gemindert und Mehrwerte für Aktionäre geschaffen werden. Von CISOs wird erwartet, dass sie ihre Strategien nicht als technische Upgrades, sondern als Wegbereiter für Umsatzsteigerungen präsentieren. Die Herausforderung besteht dabei nicht nur darin, die richtigen Investitionsentscheidungen zu treffen, sondern diese auch auf Vorstandsebene zu rechtfertigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am Anfang muss die Herausforderung stehen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs geraten oft in Erklärungsnot, wenn sie Lösungen präsentieren, bevor die Herausforderung definiert ist. Ein solches Vorgehen schafft Distanz anstelle von Übereinstimmung. Vorstände wollen verstehen, was ihre Organisation mit einem neuen Lösungsansatz erreichen kann, welche Fallstricke vermieden werden und warum Cybersecurity-Investitionen nicht aufschiebbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bei der Präsentation einer Cybersicherheitsstrategie wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt; sollte deshalb der Kommunikationsschwerpunkt mit dem Vorstand darauf liegen, wie das Cyberrisiko-Profil des Unternehmens zum Positiven verändert werden kann.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technologie mit strategischen Prioritäten verknüpfen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um in der Vorstandsetage glaubwürdig zu sein, müssen CISOs ihre geplanten Ausgaben anhand der Unternehmenszielsetzung definieren. Der Vorstand konzentriert sich auf Prioritäten wie neue Märkte zu erschließen, die Margen zu verbessern, die Widerstandsfähigkeit zu steigern und die Compliance zu gewährleisten. Ein gut durchdachter Vorschlag knüpft direkt an diese Anliegen an.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn eine Sicherheitsplattform die Reaktionszeit bei Vorfällen verkürzt, ist das Ergebnis operative Stabilität und damit eine höhere &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4004443/operationelle-resilienz-koordination-kooperation-im-fokus.html" target="_blank"&gt;Resilienz&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn sie Tools konsolidiert, sorgt sie für Kosteneffizienz. Wenn sie eine sichere Expansion in neue Regionen ermöglicht, ist Umsatzwachstum die Folge. Eine solche Argumentationskette schafft Glaubwürdigkeit und hilft dabei, Investitionen bewilligt zu bekommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eine Sprache für Risiken und Rendite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vorstände treffen Entscheidungen unter der Berücksichtigung von Begrifflichkeiten wie Risiko und Rendite. Dazu gehören finanzielle Risiken, operative Risiken und Reputationsrisiken für das Unternehmen. Vorstandsmitglieder bewerten Wahrscheinlichkeit, Exposition und Auswirkungen von Vorfällen in jedem dieser Bereiche. Dementsprechend besteht die Aufgabe des CISOs darin, zu verdeutlichen, wie eine vorgeschlagene Investition Schwachstellen reduziert, Auswirkungen von Vorfällen begrenzt oder die Resilienz der Infrastruktur erhöht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Gespräche sollten Kostenmodelle, Szenarien für mögliche Sicherheitsverletzungen, Zeitpläne für die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495970/die-besten-cyber-recovery-anbieter.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wiederherstellung nach einem Cyberangriff&lt;/a&gt; und den geschäftlichen Nutzen aufzeigen. Das Ziel sollte sein, Ausfallzeiten zu vermeiden und dabei die Sprache der Vorstände zu sprechen, ohne die technische Integrität zu vernachlässigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value bedenken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Reifegrad und auch die Denkweisen von Vorständen in Bezug auf die Cybersicherheit variieren deutlich. Einige Kontrollgremien reagieren erst nach einem größeren Cybervorfall oder einem nicht bestandenen Audit. Andere sind sehr viel proaktiver in ihrer Vorgehensweise und fordern Cybersicherheitsbewertungen als Teil ihrer Marktexpansion oder M&amp;amp;A-Aktivitäten. Andere beziehen Cybersicherheit in Simulationen ein und stellen zukunftsorientierte Fragen zur Widerstandsfähigkeit angesichts potenzieller Angriffsszenarien.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Verständnis dieses Reifegrades hilft dabei, die Kommunikationsstrategie anzupassen. Ein reaktiver Vorstand benötigt möglicherweise eine klare Erklärung der negativen Folgen. Ein informierter Vorstand erwartet eher quantifizierbare Ergebnisse und eine Roadmap. Die besten Vorstandsdiskussionen finden statt, wenn sich der CISO an das Technologieverständnis des Vorstands anpasst und gleichzeitig dessen Perspektive behutsam erweitert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesetipp: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492322/cybersecurity-messen-10-kennzahlen-die-cisos-weiterbringen.html" target="_blank"&gt;10 Kennzahlen, die CISOs weiterbringen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Exzellenz als Ergebnis positionieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eines der wirksamsten Argumente in den Gesprächen mit dem Vorstand zum Thema Cybersicherheit ist operative Exzellenz. Wenn Unternehmen in unterschiedlichen Regionen und Branchen tätig sind, müssen sie agil, abgesichert und kontrolliert arbeiten. Eine IT-Architektur sollte&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;globale Anforderungen adressieren und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;dabei Mitarbeitende unterstützen, die von überall aus arbeiten,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Drittparteien integrieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;eine Reihe von regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;geistiges Eigentum schützen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein derart umfangreiches Anforderungsprofil kann sehr schnell zu einer komplexen Umsetzung und dadurch zu Ineffizienzen führen. CISOs setzen mit einer starken Technologiestrategie auf eine vereinfachte Infrastruktur, ermöglichen sichere globale Datenflüsse und verkürzen Markteintrittszeiten. Eine solche Positionierung hebt die Diskussion von der Systemauswahl auf eine strategische Ebene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zukünftige Risiken im Fokus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Von einem Vorstand wird erwartet, dass er sich nicht nur auf aktuelle Risiken konzentriert, sondern auch auf zukünftige Szenarien. Dazu gehören beispielsweise die Regulierung der ethischen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030328/so-verandert-ki-ihre-grc-strategie.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nutzung von KI&lt;/a&gt;, das Verständnis der Auswirkungen von Datenmissbrauch und die Vorbereitung auf die Auswirkungen des Quantencomputings. Der Vorstand wird für den sicheren und regulierten Umgang mit Daten verantwortlich und sogar haftbar gemacht. Dies sind keine abstrakten Themen mehr. Deshalb sollten sie bereits jetzt als künftige technologische Herausforderungen auf der CISO-Agenda stehen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Nutzung von KI hat in Unternehmen zugenommen und Vorstände haben für die Verwendung von Daten geradezustehen. Quantencomputing ist zwar noch im Anfangsstadium, aber das Risiko der zukünftigen Technologie für heutige Verschlüsselungen macht es schon jetzt zu einem notwendigen Bestandteil jeder langfristigen Planung. Viele CISOs nutzen die Chance bereits, das Thema beim Vorstand zu positionieren und zu erklären, welche Maßnahmen in absehbarer Zukunft zum Schutz der Daten erforderlich sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Die Macht der Zahlen&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die finanzielle Ausgestaltung ist genauso wichtig wie die strategische Vorgehensweise. Da immer mehr Unternehmen von hardwareintensiven Architekturen zu Cloud-nativen SaaS- Modellen übergehen, verändert sich die Wirtschaftlichkeit der Sicherheit. Die Kosten verlagern sich von Kapitalausgaben zu Betriebsausgaben. Dies kann zwar zunächst zu einer Verringerung des EBITDA (betriebswirtschaftliche Kennzahl/Earnings Before Interest,Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) führen, eliminiert jedoch auch Hardware-Erneuerungszyklen, verbessert die Prognosegenauigkeit und senkt die langfristigen Gesamtbetriebskosten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abrechnungsmodelle pro User für Cloud-Services sorgen für Vorhersehbarkeit und höhere Flexibilität als Reaktion auf Veränderungen. Weiteres Einsparpotenzial besteht in der Konsolidierung von Tools auf wenige Plattformanbieter. Zusätzlich kann die Automatisierung von Prozessen den Service Desk entlasten und die Produktivität verbessern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztlich sollten CISOs aufzeigen, wie potenzielle Investitionen in neue Technologien den Cashflow verbessern, Margen sichern und mit dem Unternehmenswachstum skalieren. CFOs und Prüfungsausschüsse möchten wissen, wie sich jeder Vorschlag auf die Finanzergebnisse auswirkt. Sie möchten auch verstehen, was kapitalisiert werden kann, welche Ausgleichseffekte zu erwarten sind und wie sich die Investitionen mit der Nachfrage entwickeln werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fazit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztendlich geht es bei der Rechtfertigung von Security-Investitionen nicht um Überzeugungsarbeit, sondern um Einflussnahme. Es geht darum, die Geschäftsprioritäten mit sicheren, skalierbaren und kostengünstigen Lösungen in Einklang zu bringen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dementsprechend müssen CISOs eine Strategie präsentieren, die Risiken reduziert, die Agilität verbessert und das Unternehmen für langfristigen Erfolg positioniert. Wenn die IT-Führungsriege die Sprache des Mehrwerts von Lösungsansätzen spricht, klingen ihre Vorschläge nicht mehr wie technische Anforderungen, sondern wie geschäftliche Notwendigkeiten. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Recognizing and responding to cyber threats: What differentiates NDR, EDR and XDR</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4091641/recognizing-and-responding-to-cyber-threats-what-differentiates-ndr-edr-and-xdr.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The constantly growing number of acronyms in cyber security makes it difficult to maintain an overview and compare individual technologies. One example is the three closely related technologies for threat detection: network detection and response (NDR), &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/568045/what-is-edr-endpoint-detection-and-response.html" target="_blank"&gt;endpoint detection and response&lt;/a&gt; (EDR) and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574295/11-top-xdr-tools-and-how-to-evaluate-them.html" target="_blank"&gt;extended detection and response&lt;/a&gt; (XDR). Each of them offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and responding to different cyberattacks. Although they are based on similar approaches, there are some differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="edr-identifies-noticeable-changes-at-the-endpoint"&gt;EDR identifies noticeable changes at the endpoint&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EDR, the oldest of the three detection technologies, monitors endpoints to mitigate attacks on them. Endpoints are network devices such as PCs, file servers, smartphones and IoT devices that connect to the network to communicate. A software agent is used to inventory EDR malware and suspicious activity detected on the endpoint, such as registry changes and key file tampering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As network environments become more complex over time and threat actors and malware become more sophisticated, EDR faces the following challenges:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Required EDR agents cannot be deployed on all devices or in all environments, leaving gaps in visibility and opening the door for attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common applications can bypass EDR. For example, Microsoft SQL Server has administrative access to the underlying Windows operating system without using any of the EDR-monitored environments mentioned above, allowing an attacker to bypass endpoint detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malware and attackers are becoming more sophisticated and are able to detect anti-malware software on the endpoint or hide evidence of endpoint compromise altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While EDR is a necessary component of a modern cybersecurity strategy, it cannot be used alone for comprehensive cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="xdr-offers-holistic-protection"&gt;XDR offers holistic protection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people mistakenly think of XDR as a product or an evolution of EDR. However, XDR is a strategy that consists of a combination of security-related telemetry data coupled with high-fidelity detection to enable faster and more effective incident response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are different types of XDR. There is a proprietary XDR strategy that focuses on a single vendor or an “all-in-one” platform that provides telemetry data from a vendor’s various products, for example, their firewalls, EDR, NDR and so on. There is also an open XDR strategy that consists of multiple vendors or “best-of-breed” technologies or tools. Here, telemetry data is provided by different product types (such as firewall, intrusion detection system [IDS], EDR and NDR) and vendors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations believe that an EDR-centric XDR strategy is sufficient, but this leads to a problematic blind spot. If the EDR agent overview is lost, there is no other way to find or investigate a potential critical security breach. With this single-point focused telemetry strategy, attackers only need to bypass one technology or defense to penetrate the network. Cybersecurity managers need to detect changes in network activity and compare it to endpoint and cloud data. This is where NDR solutions can provide the context needed to focus on potential cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading tip:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4012841/6-key-trends-redefining-the-xdr-market.html"&gt;6 key trends redefining the XDR market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ndr-detects-threats-at-packet-level-and-reacts-in-real-time"&gt;NDR detects threats at packet level and reacts in real time&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike EDR or XDR solutions, NDR focuses on analyzing packet data in network traffic to detect potential cyberthreats, rather than endpoints or other data streams. By combining NDR with other solutions such as log analysis tools via &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/524286/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html" target="_blank"&gt;security information and event management&lt;/a&gt; (SIEM) and EDR, organizations can mitigate blind spots in their networks. Together, NDR solutions increase security capabilities by providing network context and automating responses to threats, enabling better collaboration between network and IT security teams and faster mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in the context of NDR, it is important to differentiate the capabilities of advanced platforms that provide features that modern cybersecurity stacks should include. For example, when evaluating different NDRs, it is important to ensure that they offer reliable forensics with long-term data retention. It is also crucial that they do not rely on NetFlow-based data. These are not supported in all environments and offer opportunities for sophisticated tunneling-based attacks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced NDR systems should even provide a retrospective view of network traffic to examine threat behavior before, during and after attacks. So if an indicator of compromise (IOC) is detected, security teams can examine the compromised hosts’ communications, detect lateral movement and determine if a data breach has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="edr-xdr-ndr-together-they-are-strong"&gt;EDR, XDR, NDR: Together they are strong&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To summarize, EDRs are designed to monitor and mitigate attacks on endpoints via connected computers and servers. However, only where agents can be deployed. Therefore, EDR does not work in some cloud-based hosting environments, for example. In contrast, XDRs provide a more unified platform approach to monitoring devices and data streams, but often lack the network context that NDRs provide through real-time packet monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most large organizations today require a more comprehensive solution that combines network and endpoint data with other security solutions to provide a more robust, real-time view of the ever-changing threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced NDR solutions provide a high level of network intelligence and effectively complement the rest of the security stack. In addition to SIEM, an advanced NDR solution can also be integrated into &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3622920/soar-buyers-guide-11-security-orchestration-automation-and-response-products-and-how-to-choose.html" target="_blank"&gt;security orchestration, automation and response&lt;/a&gt; (SOAR) or firewall platforms to initiate immediate blocking at the network perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all, it is impossible to cover your tracks on the network and cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Working together, these systems provide a complete overview of attacker behavior and indicators of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced NDR makes an important contribution to the overall cyber security strategy and helps to minimize operational risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Root causes of security breaches remain elusive — jeopardizing resilience</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093403/root-causes-of-security-breaches-remain-elusive-jeopardizing-resilience.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-incident analysis remains a critical concern at most security organizations today. According to Foundry’s Security Priorities study, 57% of security leaders report their organization struggled to find the root cause of security incidents experienced in the past year, leaving them at heightened risk of getting breached again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts tell CSO the finding underscores that the immediate pressure to firefight often leaves post-incident learning under-resourced. Organizations need to treat &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009438/how-to-conduct-an-effective-post-incident-review.html"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt; as a continuous learning cycle, not a one-time clean-up exercise if they are to reduce the likelihood of repeat breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations are stuck in a reactive cycle, focusing solely on containing the immediate breach, which comes at the expense of a crucial forensic investigation, leaving the ‘patient door’ wide open for the next attacker to walk right back in,” &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/authors/dray-agha"&gt;Dray Agha&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of security operations at managed security response firm Huntress, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a thorough postmortem to pinpoint the root cause, companies are essentially defending themselves blindfolded, destined to repeat the same mistakes,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-through-root-cause-analysis"&gt;Resilience through root cause analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agree that too many enterprises treat incident response as an operational exercise rather than an analytical one. As a result, containment and recovery actions might be well-rehearsed while deeper forensic investigation and post-incident learning lag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a disciplined approach to evidence preservation and &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/350219/what-is-root-cause-analysis-a-proactive-approach-to-change-management.html"&gt;root cause analysis&lt;/a&gt;, valuable insights are lost,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-moore-724212/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Tom Moore&lt;/a&gt;, director of digital forensics and incident response at managed security services vendor BlueVoyant. “Robust incident response isn’t just about getting systems back online — it’s about using lessons learned to inform detection, prevention, and risk mitigation strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moore adds: “That continuous feedback loop ultimately drives long-term resilience and is particularly valuable when the cyber threat landscape is evolving and adapting so quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariehargraves/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Marie Hargraves&lt;/a&gt;, principal crisis management consultant at cloud security vendor Semperis, agrees that “most organizations focus on fighting fires instead of learning from the flames.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every crisis has three phases: detection, response (the acute phase), and review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the third phase, the post-crisis review, where resilience is built,” Hargraves says. “Organizations that capture real-time data, analyze it rigorously, and act on lessons identified recover faster and emerge stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Incident response isn’t just about surviving; it’s about adapting and building resilience,” Hargraves adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tracing-an-attack-path"&gt;Tracing an attack path&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preparation is key, so businesses need to have dedicated tools and skills for digital forensics in place before an incident occurs through technologies such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/524286/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html"&gt;security incident and event management (SIEM)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/566677/12-top-siem-tools-rated-and-compared.html"&gt;SIEM devices&lt;/a&gt; are important because, for example, many gateway and VPN devices have a local storage that overwrites itself within hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If a cybercriminal breaks in through the VPN and dwells for a day or so before they pivot to business-critical servers, then the VPN telemetry has evaporated into the abyss,” Huntress’ Agha explains. “The centralization and retention of VPN logs, like through a SIEM, allows for reactive detections but also stores valuable data and allows for root cause analysis to figure out how the initial breach [occurred].”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistics from Huntress show that near 70% of sophisticated cybercriminals break in through the VPN. “Where SIEM has been enabled, we are able to catch them much earlier in their attack path, but also deploy retrospective analysis to identify the exact root cause that led to the breach,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various services such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573533/top-12-managed-detection-and-response-solutions.html"&gt;managed detection and response (MDR)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574295/11-top-xdr-tools-and-how-to-evaluate-them.html"&gt;extended detection and response (XDR)&lt;/a&gt; can also include forensic capturing software — technology that enables providers to work hand in hand with forensic cyber investigators to identify the source of the breach and work to remediate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without tools such as this, trying to work back retrospectively to identify the ‘how’ becomes increasingly difficult,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-derbyshire-48291b25/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Rob Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at cybersecurity firm Securus Communication. “There are companies that offer incident response services when breaches occur, but the key to sorting it quickly, and preventing it from happening again, is ensuring you already have the tooling and processes to make any response significantly slicker.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eclecticiq.com/eclecticiq-intelligence-research-team-arda-b%C3%BCy%C3%BCkkaya"&gt;Arda Büyükkaya&lt;/a&gt;, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at EclecticIQ, points out that without thorough root-cause analysis the “actual cause of the attack remains unknown and potentially still active.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Best practices should include digital forensics expertise, root cause analysis processes, and threat intelligence integration to connect incidents to broader attacker tactics and campaigns,” Büyükkaya advises. “This approach allows organizations to build resilience from every incident.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="robust-planning"&gt;Robust planning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An incident response team, typically led by the CISO, should be designated to take charge during an incident. The plan should also specify roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder, from IT staff to legal advisors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts quizzed by CSO say an incident response playbook boils down to a few key steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a tested incident response plan, clear roles, and escalation paths.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection and analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Centralize monitoring, leverage threat intelligence, and ensure forensic capability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containment and recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Act fast but preserve evidence; validate systems before restoration.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postmortem:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct structured reviews, document findings, and feed them into security architecture and training.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate threat modeling, automate containment, and invest in skills development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations opt to use established frameworks and ISO standards as templates for their incident response plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These frameworks offer a structured approach, providing sections and subsections that cover all essential areas, from governance to technical responses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-ford-a4026421/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Richard Ford&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Integrity360. “By using a recognized framework, you not only ensure completeness but also facilitate easier communication with external parties who may be familiar with the framework.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-organizational-resilience"&gt;Building organizational resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective incident response should be geared toward building a structured, repeatable, and intelligence-driven process that strengthens resilience over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incident response plans should be regularly tested, refined, and updated — for example, through simulations or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a wider business continuity and organizational resilience strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharat-mistry-952414/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Bharat Mistry&lt;/a&gt;, field CTO at cybersecurity vendor Trend Micro, says many organizations suffer from a maturity gap in their incident response — which should extend beyond simply containment and recovery to encompass forensic analysis and postmortems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When organizations bypass root cause analysis, they are only treating symptoms,” Mistry warns. “This challenge stems from a combination of issues: fragmented visibility due to siloed tools that prevent accurate attack reconstruction, a skills gap that leaves teams short on forensics and threat hunting expertise, and process weaknesses where postmortems are often informal or simply skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="breaking-the-cycle-of-breach-patch-repeat"&gt;Breaking the cycle of ‘breach, patch, repeat’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, evidence is inadvertently destroyed, such as when servers are wiped, logs are lost, and forensic trails disappear, because the emphasis is on restoring operations quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is compounded by pressure from the business, time constraints, as well as limited resources, which push teams to move on to the next urgent task rather than learning from the incident,” Mistry adds. “As a result, retrospective scans, root cause analysis, and updates to procedures are frequently skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial attack vector and lateral movement often remain unknown, leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed and creating a cycle of “breach, patch, repeat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To break this cycle, organizations must embed forensic readiness into their response strategy: preserve evidence, conduct structured postmortems, and ensure lessons learned are fed back into security architecture and training,” Mistry concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
