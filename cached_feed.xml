      <description>U.S. prosecutors last week levied criminal hacking charges against 19-year-old U.K. national Thalha Jubair for allegedly being a core member of Scattered Spider, a prolific cybercrime group blamed for extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments from victims. The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.</description>

      <description>Austrian and Colombian law enforcement authorities, supported by Europol, have rescued dozens of Colombian women from violent sexual exploitation in Europe. The raids performed on 5 September 2025 in Medellin, Colombia, saw the arrest of five suspected Colombian human traffickers on international arrest warrants. One Uruguayan man and one Colombian woman were already arrested in August 2025 in Spain, while two Austrian women and a Romanian woman remain detained in Austria.
