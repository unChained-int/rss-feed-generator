      <title>HPE OneView vulnerable to remote code execution attack</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109162/hpe-oneview-vulnerable-to-remote-code-execution-attack.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A maximum severity remote code execution vulnerability in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) OneView network and systems management suite is “bad” and needs to be patched immediately, says a cybersecurity expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vendors typically downplay the severity of a vulnerability,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/curtis-dukes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Curtis Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, executive VP for security best practices at the Center for Internet Security, “but HPE did not – it’s a 10.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is remotely executable by an unauthenticated user, he added, and it impacts every recent version of the suite. On top of that, he pointed out, OneView is a central manager of IT infrastructure in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For these reasons, the patch should be implemented immediately,” Dukes said.  “Adversaries, nation-state, and criminal gangs alike know there is a window of opportunity and are likely working on an exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPE says in &lt;a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=hpesbgn04985en_us&amp;amp;docLocale=en_US#hpesbgn04985-rev-1-hewlett-packard-enterprise-onev-0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its advisory&lt;/a&gt; that the vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37164" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-37164&lt;/a&gt;, affects all versions between 5.20 and 10.20.  It can be resolved by applying a security hotfix, which must be reapplied after an appliance upgrade from HPE OneView version 6.60.xx to 7.00.00, as well as after any HPE Synergy Composer reimage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPE offers separate hotfixes for &lt;a href="https://myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/cwp-ui/product-details/HPE_OV_CVE_37164_Z7550-98077/-/sw_free" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HPE OneView virtual appliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/swd/detail?swCollectionId=MTX-64daeb5ed0df44a0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HPE Synergy Composer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advisory adds that any third party security patches that are to be installed on systems running HPE software products should be applied in accordance with the customer’s patch management policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, an HPE spokesperson said the company has nothing to say beyond its advisory, other than to urge admins to download and install the patches as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bicer/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jack Bicer&lt;/a&gt;, director of vulnerability research at Action1, said that because this vulnerability can be exploited without authentication or any user interaction, it is “an extremely severe security issue. There are no available workarounds, so the patch should be applied immediately. Until the patch can be applied, restrict network access to the OneView management interface to trusted administrative networks only.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPE describes OneView as a solution that simplifies infrastructure lifecycle management across compute storage and networking through a unified API. It allows admins to create a catalogue of workload-optimized infrastructure templates so more general IT staff can rapidly and reliably provision resources. These templates can quickly provision physical, virtual, and containerized systems, setting up BIOS settings, local RAID configuration, firmware baseline, shared storage and more. HPE says software-defined intelligence allows IT to run multiple applications simultaneously with repeatable templates that ensure high reliability, consistency, and control. The vendor also says the embedded automation speeds provisioning and lowers operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most recent major vulnerability in OneView was revealed in June: &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37101" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-37101&lt;/a&gt;, a local elevation of privilege issue which relates specifically to OneView for VMware vCenter. If exploited, an attacker with read only privilege could upgrade their access to allow them to perform admin actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing agentic AI risk: Lessons from the OWASP Top 10</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109123/managing-agentic-ai-risk-lessons-from-the-owasp-top-10.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LLM-powered chatbots have risks that we see playing out in the headlines on a nearly daily basis. But chatbots are limited to answering questions. AI agents, however, access data and tools and carry out tasks, making them infinitely more capable – and more dangerous to enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/"&gt;OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications&lt;/a&gt; can help CISOs explain what the issues are to their business counterparts. It can also help CISOs to directly improve agentic AI security, because it comes with &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/"&gt;threats taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, mitigation strategies and playbooks, and example threat models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s all part of &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/initiatives/agentic-security-initiative/"&gt;OWASP’s&lt;/a&gt; Agentic Security Initiative. Scott Clinton, OWASP GenAI security project board co-chair and co-founder, says he was surprised by how many agentic solutions were already deployed in organizations that the OWASP team uncovered while they were researching the list. And how many of those solutions were deployed without the knowledge of IT and security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This level of risk is unprecedented, he says. That includes a lot of theoretical, “academic” risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However, we focused on those that were data-driven,” he says. “Where we would provide practical guidance based on real-world conditions today.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-challenge-of-educating-stakeholders"&gt;The challenge of educating stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a CSO, chances are you are having quite a time educating your stakeholders about the risks that are being introduced by the use cases that are probably being pushed on you,” says Kayla Underkoffler, director of AI security and policy advocacy at Zenity, an AI security company, and one of the core contributors to the OWASP list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO might not be able to say no, she adds – but might also be a little hesitant to say that the company can go all in and adopt the technology without thinking of the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list was deliberately designed to be consumable, she says. “It will help with threat modeling, help with telling the story, help explain what controls need to be in place to reduce the risk and why.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A security leader can get an agentic AI use case from the business and align the top risks to fit that use case. The list also provides a common language around agentic AI and its risks, Underkoffler says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="actionable-guidance"&gt;Actionable guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI is the main topic of conversation in discussions among his peers, says Keith Hillis, VP of security engineering at Akamai Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most organizations are confronted with the challenge of balancing the promising power of AI while also ensuring the organization is not incurring increased security risk,” he says. So, the biggest value he finds in the new Agentic AI OWASP top 10 is that it’s immediately useful. “It’s directly actionable as a control baseline in both security architecture and governance, risk, and compliance contexts,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One aspect of the list that he found particularly insightful was the evolution of “least privilege” to “least agency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He recommends that CISOs use the list to assess their programs, identify gaps, and map out a plan of action for improvement. “Most likely already have active programs in place,” he says. But it’s also likely they will need to evolve to accommodate the specific risks of agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="missing-pieces"&gt;Missing pieces&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only thing that’s lacking in this first release of the list is that some of the mitigation sections aren’t detailed enough, says Zenity’s Underkoffler.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are plans to address that. “We have some efforts to really dive into the mitigations for security teams, to help implement these controls,” she says. “Not just descriptions of what you should do but real code examples of how you can implement them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, she says, one of the suggested mitigations is to “apply the principle of least privilege”. “Which is completely accurate,” she says. “Everyone should apply the principle of least privilege. But what does that mean for agents?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rick Holland, data and AI security officer at Cyera, a data security vendor, says he’d like the list to explain the likelihood of each type of attack. “Not all threat actors are created equal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For organizations targeted by nation-state actors, for example, the attackers might use more sophisticated attack vectors, like memory and context poisoning or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015077/ai-supply-chain-threats-are-looming-as-security-practices-lag.html"&gt;agentic supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Rank-and-file cybercriminals might go after more low-hanging fruit, Holland says, using techniques like agent goal hijack or tool misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jose Lazu, associate director of product management at CMD+CTRL, a security training company, says that there are some second-tier risks that could have been included, such as model and tuning supply-chain integrity, long-horizon data poisoning, multi-agent coordination exploits, and cost-based resource exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These areas are evolving quickly, so CSOs need to keep them on their radar,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="owasp-top-10-for-agentic-ai"&gt;OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below we list the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026, a framework that identifies the most critical security risks facing autonomous and agentic AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-agent-goal-hijack"&gt;1 – Agent Goal Hijack&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers use prompt injection, poisoned data, and other tactics to manipulate the AI agent’s goals, so that the agent carries out unwanted actions. For example, a malicious prompt can manipulate a financial agent into sending money to an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-tool-misuse-and-exploitation"&gt;2 – Tool Misuse and Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agents misuse legitimate, authorized tools for data exfiltration, destructive actions, and other unwanted behaviors. In fact, we’ve already seen examples of &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4081125/whos-the-real-boss-of-your-ai.html"&gt;AI agents deleting databases&lt;/a&gt; and wiping hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-identity-and-privilege-abuse"&gt;3 – Identity and Privilege Abuse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flaws in agent identity, delegation, or privilege inheritance allow attackers to escalate access, exploit confused deputy scenarios, or execute unauthorized actions across systems. For example, an attacker can use a low-privilege AI agent to relay instructions to a high-privilege in order to do things they’re not supposed to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-agentic-supply-chain-vulnerabilities"&gt;4 – Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compromised or malicious third-party agents, tools, models, interfaces, or registries introduce hidden instructions or unsafe behavior into agentic ecosystems. For example, an attacker can embed hidden instructions into a tool’s meta-data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-unexpected-code-execution"&gt;5 – Unexpected Code Execution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agent-generated or agent-invoked code executes in unintended or adversarial ways, leading to host, container, or environment compromise. AI agents can generate code on the fly, bypassing normal software controls, and attackers can leverage this. For example, a coding agent writing a security patch might include a hidden back door due to poisoned training data or adversarial prompts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-memory-and-context-poisoning"&gt;6 – Memory and Context Poisoning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers corrupt persistent agent memory, RAG stores, embeddings, or shared context to affect an agent’s future actions. For example, an attacker keeps mentioning a fake price for a product, which gets stored into an agent’s memory, and the agent might later think the price is valid and approves bookings at that price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contaminated context and shared memory can spread between agents, compounding corruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-insecure-inter-agent-communication"&gt;7 – Insecure Inter-Agent Communication&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weak authentication, integrity, or semantic validation in agent-to-agent messaging enables spoofing, tampering, replay, or manipulation. For example, an attacker can register a fake agent in a discovery service, and intercept privileged coordination traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-cascading-failures"&gt;8 – Cascading Failures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single fault, such as hallucination, poisoned memory, or compromised tool, propagates across autonomous agents. For example, a regional outage in a hyperscaler can break multiple AI services, leading to a cascade of agent failures across many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-human-agent-trust-exploitation"&gt;9 – Human-Agent Trust Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agents exploit human trust, authority bias, or automation bias to influence decisions or extract sensitive information. For example, a compromised IT support agent can request credentials from an employee and send them to the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-rogue-agents"&gt;10 – Rogue Agents&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agents can act harmfully and deceptively in such a way that individual actions may appear legitimate. This could be due to prompt injection, or due to conflicting objectives or reward hacking. For example, an agent whose job is to reduce cloud costs might figure out that deleting files is the most efficient way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <title>Iranian APT Prince of Persia returns with new malware and C2 infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109985/iranian-apt-prince-of-persia-returns-with-new-malware-and-c2-infrastructure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered new activity from a threat actor dubbed Prince of Persia that’s believed to be tied to the Iranian government. The group appeared to have gone dormant in 2022 after multiple security companies documented its operations and crippled its command-and-control infrastructure, but new evidence shows the attackers retooled and continued to target new victims under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prince of Persia, also known as Infy based on the name of its original malware, has been operating for almost 20 years. Researchers have noted likely ties to Iran based on the group’s target selection and other factors. Victims were previously identified in 35 countries and included Iranian dissidents and government targets from Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first company to &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prince-of-persia-infy-malware-active-in-decade-of-targeted-attacks/"&gt;document the group’s attacks and malware toolkit in detail was Palo Alto Networks back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. That same year the company &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-of-persia-game-over/"&gt;executed a successful takedown operation&lt;/a&gt; that involved sinkholing the group’s command-and control servers. However, the group was back one year later with new malware variants dubbed Foudre and Tonnerre — lighting and thunder in French.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite the appearance of having gone dark in 2022, Prince of Persia threat actors have done quite the opposite,” researchers from security firm SafeBreach said in &lt;a href="https://www.safebreach.com/blog/prince-of-persia-a-decade-of-an-iranian-nation-state-apt-campaign-activity"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;. “Our ongoing research campaign into this prolific and elusive group has highlighted critical details about their activities, C2 servers, and identified malware variants in the last three years. This threat group is still active, relevant, and dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="changes-in-malware-delivery-and-c2-infrastructure"&gt;Changes in malware delivery and C2 infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the group fell off the radar in 2022, the latest known version of Foudre was v27 and for Tonnerre it was v15. Today, the most recent versions recovered by researchers are Foudre v34 and Tonnerre v17, both of which include significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foudre is first-stage malware used for reconnaissance and victim identification. If a target is deemed important enough, the Tonnerre Trojan is deployed for data exfiltration and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foudre used to be distributed through malicious macros embedded in Microsoft Office documents sent as attachments in phishing emails on topics of interest to their targets. The latest version is delivered as an Excel file with an embedded malicious executable that’s not detected by any antivirus engine on VirusTotal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The embedded executable is a self-extracting archive (SFX) file that contains a malicious DLL and a decoy MP4 video file. Excel files with malicious macros continue to be used and they attempt to execute a file called ccupdate.tmp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major difference compared to previous versions is the switch to a new domain generation algorithm (DGA) through which the malware determines on which domain names it will find the command-and-control server. Tonnerre v17 uses the same DGA with a different key prefix, meaning the domains it will generate for C2 will be different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SafeBreach researchers managed to identify many C2 servers and to extract data from them. Some servers were used for testing while other had data collected from real victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the victims were located in Iran, but there were some across Europe and countries like Iraq, Turkey, India, and Canada,” the researchers said. “While we have chosen not to publish the data here due to privacy concerns, we are more than willing to share the data with authorized law enforcement agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the group’s campaigns is difficult because the attackers switch C2 servers quite often and they issue commands to delete the malware from the systems of victims that are no longer of interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-shift-to-telegram"&gt;A shift to Telegram&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, the researchers identified a new Tonnerre variant that’s advertised as v50, as well as an unknown new Foudre version that goes along with it. These versions use a new C2 server structure and, most importantly, can download a file from the server that enables Telegram communication via its API.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Telegram feature is enabled only for a select number of victims, but the researchers managed to use the API to query the configured Telegram channel. It had two members, one of which was a channel bot and one user named Ehsan written in Farsi, who could be one of the hackers in charge of controlling the malware and who was last active as of Dec. 13.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ehsan is a common Persian name typical for an Iranian,” the researchers said. “This attribution is pretty strong in combination with the IP location of the attacker’s testing machine. We tracked the IP addresses used over several years, all of which indicated Iran as the location. While different IP location databases provided different cities, all of them were in Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered other samples of malware and payloads used in campaigns prior to 2022, including signs of an additional malware family called Rugissement (roar in French), a newer version of MaxPinner, a Telegram-based trojan used by the group in 2021, as well as various trojanized binaries used to distribute the malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report includes details about the new DGA algorithms as well as indicators of compromise and sample hashes in hopes it will help other companies and researchers track the elusive group’s activities going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Dismantling Defenses: Trump 2.0 Cyber Year in Review</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/12/dismantling-defenses-trump-2-0-cyber-year-in-review/</link>
      <description>The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation’s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.</description>

      <title>WatchGuard fixes ‘critical’ zero-day allowing firewall takeover</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109884/watchguard-fixes-critical-zero-day-allowing-firewall-takeover.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WatchGuard has issued an urgent patch alert for its Firebox firewall appliances after discovering a critical-rated vulnerability that is under exploit by threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracked as &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14733" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-14733&lt;/a&gt;, with a CVSS score of 9.3, the flaw is an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability affecting the iked process, a WatchGuard Fireware OS component responsible for the IKEv2 key exchange in IPSec VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00027" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WatchGuard advisory&lt;/a&gt;, this weakness could “allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code,” taking control of the appliance through remote code execution (RCE) without having to log in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because it was under attack before a patch was made available by WatchGuard on December 18, this makes CVE-2025-14733 a bona fide zero-day vulnerability. The first job for admins should therefore be to check Firebox appliances for signs of current or recent compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WatchGuard’s advisory lists four IP addresses associated with exploitation; outbound traffic to them is “a strong indicator of compromise,” while inbound connections from them “could indicate reconnaissance efforts or exploit attempts,” the advisory said. With logging enabled, other strong indicators were an IKE_AUTH request log message with an abnormally large CERT payload greater than 2,000 bytes, or evidence of an iked process hang, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Affected Fireware OS versions are 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3, 12.0 up to and including 12.11.5, and legacy 11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resolved versions are 2025.1.4, 12.11.6, 12.5.15 (T15 &amp;amp; T35 models), and 12.3.1_Update4 (B728352) for the FIPS-certified release. There is no fix for 11.x, which is considered &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-trust-center/end-of-life-policy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;end of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, WatchGuard warned, patching may not be enough: “If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And some admins have even more post-patching tasks to perform, it said, noting, “in addition to installing the latest Fireware OS that contains the fix, administrators that have confirmed threat actor activity on their Firebox appliances must take precautions to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable Firebox appliances.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deja-vu"&gt;Deja vu&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, WatchGuard patched a similar &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059623/watchguard-patches-critical-vpn-flaw-in-firewalls-that-could-lead-to-compromise.html" target="_blank"&gt;Firebox vulnerability, CVE-2025-9242&lt;/a&gt;, also affecting the iked VPN configuration and given a CVSS score of 9.3. At the time, WatchGuard said there were no reports of active exploitation, but by October, the company had &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00015" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revised this assessment&lt;/a&gt; after exploitation attempts were detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder not to read initial vulnerability assessments for this type of infrastructure too optimistically — exploitation is frequently detected after a flaw has been made public. Firewalls and VPNs are major targets for cybercriminals, and every significant vulnerability in them represents a clear and present cyber security risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the evidence shows that some WatchGuard customers don’t patch vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. In October, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Shadowserver/status/1979902019696509099" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a scan by The Shadowserver Foundation&lt;/a&gt; found that over 71,000 Firebox appliances had not yet been patched for CVE-2025-9242, including 23,000 in the US. Despite its zero-day status, it’s likely to be a similar story for CVE-2025-14733.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slow or reluctant patching might also explain why Russian-aligned ‘Sandworm’ hackers were recently discovered to be &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4107406/russian-apt-group-pivots-to-network-edge-device-misconfigurations.html" target="_blank"&gt;targeting WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances&lt;/a&gt; by exploiting CVEs dating back several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
