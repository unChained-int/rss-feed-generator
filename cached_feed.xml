      <title>Iranian APT hacks helped direct missile strikes in Israel and the Red Sea</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093375/iranian-apt-hacks-helped-direct-missile-strikes-in-israel-and-the-red-sea.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber-related activities of two Iran-linked threat actors played key roles in subsequent high-profile missile strikes, according to Amazon’s Threat Intel team, which sees the incidents as indicative of increased use of cyber operations in support of kinetic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We believe that cyber-enabled kinetic targeting will become increasingly common across multiple adversaries,” CJ Moses, CISO of Amazon Integrated Security, wrote in &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/new-amazon-threat-intelligence-findings-nation-state-actors-bridging-cyber-and-kinetic-warfare/"&gt;a blog post documenting the two incidents&lt;/a&gt;. “Nation-state actors are recognizing the force multiplier effect of combining digital reconnaissance with physical attacks. This trend represents a fundamental evolution in warfare, where the traditional boundaries between cyber and kinetic operations are dissolving.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While not a new development in the age of hybrid warfare, the incidents documented by Amazon shed new light on how missile strikes in the Red Sea and Israel were directly supported by cyber espionage efforts to gather target reconnaissance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="imperial-kitten-hacks-into-maritime-ship-tracking-system"&gt;Imperial Kitten hacks into maritime ship tracking system&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the kinetic attacks Amazon was able to correlate to cyber operations occurred in early February 2024 when Houthi rebels launched missiles at a commercial vessel in the Red Sea as part of a campaign to disrupt shipping through the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strike was unsuccessful, with US Central Command reporting on February 1 that two Houthi-fired missiles impacted the water without hitting the ship, resulting in no injuries or damage reported. However, Amazon’s threat intelligence data now shows that an APT group known as Imperial Kitten searched Automatic Identification System (AIS) location data for that exact same vessel days prior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Active since at least 2017, Imperial Kitten, also known as Tortoiseshell or TA456, is a threat actor believed to be part of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Over the years the group has targeted the maritime industry, including shipbuilding as well as shipping logistics organizations, alongside other industries such as defense, technology, telecommunications, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Amazon, the group compromised a vessel’s AIS platform in December 2021 and followed up with attacks in 2022 on additional vessel systems, including on-board CCTV cameras aboard one ship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AIS is an automatic tracking system that uses VHF radio to exchange information about a ship’s identification, position, speed, and course with shore stations as well as other vessels. Gaining access to a ship’s AIS platform would allow hackers to search for other vessels as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the Houthis are backed by Iran and a known APT linked to the Iranian government was seen searching AIS data for a specific vessel days before it was targeted in a Houthi-launched missile attack, Amazon believes the correlation is “unmistakable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This case demonstrates how cyber operations can provide adversaries with the precise intelligence needed to conduct targeted physical attacks against maritime infrastructure — a critical component of global commerce and military logistics,” Amazon’s Moses said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="muddywater-uses-hacked-cctv-cameras-to-help-guide-missiles"&gt;MuddyWater uses hacked CCTV cameras to help guide missiles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazon also found supporting threat intel evidence for another Iran-linked incident involving cyber espionage and missile strikes that has received some official confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the US strikes against Iran’s nuclear sites in June, Iran retaliated by launching a barrage of missiles against Israel, targeting cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. A former Israeli cybersecurity official claimed that Iranian operatives were trying to access private surveillance cameras to assess the impact of their strikes and improve their accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Israel’s National Cyber Directorate also confirmed to Bloomberg at around the same time that CCTV systems were increasingly targeted by Iranian hackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s data shows that MuddyWater, a threat group linked to an Iranian company acting as a front for Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), accessed a compromised server containing live CCTV streams from Jerusalem days before a widespread Iranian missile attack against the city.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access to the compromised CCTV server was achieved via server infrastructure that MuddyWater had set up in May for its cyber operations, showing a direct link to the group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The targeting of CCTV cameras for intelligence gathering in support of military operations is not unique to Iran. In May 2024, intelligence agencies from the US and multiple NATO countries warned in &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/21/2003719846/-1/-1/0/CSA_RUSSIAN_GRU_TARGET_LOGISTICS.PDF"&gt;a joint advisory&lt;/a&gt; that Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, hacked into cameras at key locations, such as near border crossings, military installations, and rail stations, in Ukraine and neighboring countries. The goal was to track the movement of materials into Ukraine as part of aid shipments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the cybersecurity community, this research serves as both a warning and a call to action,” Amazon’s Moses said. “Defenders must adapt their strategies to address threats that span both digital and physical domains. Organizations that historically believed they weren’t of interest to threat actors could now be targeted for tactical intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amazon suggests organizations should expand their threat modeling to consider how their compromised IT systems could be used to support physical attacks, especially the operators of critical infrastructure, maritime systems, urban surveillance networks, and other data sources that could be used to aid targeting in kinetic operations. The company has coined the term “cyber-enabled kinetic targeting” for cyber operations whose goal is to facilitate and enhance kinetic military operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>End of the game for cybercrime infrastructure: 1025 servers taken down</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down</link>
      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Wie jede Technologie birgt auch künstliche Intelligenz (KI) nicht nur Vorteile. Insbesondere seit dem Aufkommen von Generative AI (&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2821922/was-ist-generative-ai.html" target="_blank" title="GenAI"&gt;GenAI&lt;/a&gt;) und der explosionsartigen Verbreitung entsprechender Tools und Lösungen ist es für Unternehmen wichtiger denn je, die Risiken &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492643/generative-aieine-neue-herausforderung-fur-den-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen"&gt;in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen&lt;/a&gt;. Entsprechend steht das Thema GenAI bei Rechts-, Compliance- und Datenschutzverantwortlichen &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-12-13-gartner-says-legal-compliance-and-privacy-leaders-rank-rapid-generative-ai-adoption-their-top-issue-in-the-next-two-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="einer Gartner-Umfrage"&gt;einer Gartner-Umfrage&lt;/a&gt; zufolge in den nächsten zwei Jahren ganz oben auf der Agenda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um KI-Risiken entgegenzuwirken, neue Bedrohungen zu minimieren sowie Compliance und Datenschutz zu gewährleisten, müssen Anwenderunternehmen ihr KI-Engagement gründlich bewerten, Risiken abwägen und Richtlinien sowie Strategien &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492417/ki-vs-mensch-der-aufstieg-des-ai-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="definieren"&gt;definieren&lt;/a&gt;. Die Bewertungsstrategien unterscheiden sich dabei je nach Art der eingesetzten KI-Lösung. Ganz allgemein lassen sich die Risiken in Zusammenhang mit der Technologie in drei Kategorien einteilen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;interne KI-Projekte,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KI-Lösungen von Drittanbietern sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;schadhafter KI-Einsatz durch Bedrohungsakteure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden nehmen wir die einzelnen Bereiche ausführlich unter die Lupe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="interne-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Interne KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Risiken bewerten zu können, müssen Unternehmen im ersten Schritt wissen, wie künstliche Intelligenz intern eingesetzt wird. Um das zu bewerkstelligen, bieten sich zwei Möglichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Softwareunternehmen Abbyy bewertet und quantifiziert die Performance seiner KI-Modelle schon seit einigen Jahren. Dafür verwendet das Unternehmen Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement – unter anderem das &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="ISO Risk Management Framework"&gt;ISO Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Spezielle Risikomanagement-Frameworks für künstliche Intelligenz werden derzeit erarbeitet – sowohl &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in den USA"&gt;in den USA&lt;/a&gt; als auch &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/de/policies/regulatory-framework-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in Europa"&gt;in Europa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warum Abbyy für seine internen GenAI-Projekte in erster Linie auf ältere Frameworks setzt, erklärt Andrew Pery, AI Ethics Evangelist beim KI-Softwarespezialisten, folgendermaßen: “Diese Frameworks sind noch sehr rudimentär. Es ist noch zu früh, sie zum Einsatz zu bringen. Unser Kernprodukt extrahiert Daten und Inhalte aus Dokumenten und wir haben spezifische Genauigkeitsziele für unsere traditionellen KI-Modelle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut einer &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/state-of-ai-report-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wiz-Untersuchung"&gt;Wiz-Untersuchung&lt;/a&gt; von 150.000 Public-Cloud-Accounts kommen in 70 Prozent der Cloud-Umgebungen inzwischen Generative-AI-Dienste zum Einsatz. Die beliebteste KI-Plattform ist dabei mit 53 Prozent die von OpenAI. Dicht gefolgt von Hugging Face und anderen Open-Source-Projekten. Diese Plattformen zu nutzen, birgt für Unternehmen diverse Risiken, beispielsweise mit Blick darauf, dass eingegebene Daten für das KI-Modelltraining verwendet werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein umfassender Überblick darüber, welche KI-Lösungen wo zum Einsatz kommen, ist deshalb unerlässlich. Laut Priya Iragavarapu, VP of Technology Services bei der Unternehmensberatung AArete, erfordert das sowohl einen Top-Down- als auch einen Bottom-Up-Ansatz: “Unternehmensentscheider sollten Prozesse, bei denen KI beteiligt ist, überprüfen und mit dem KI-Governance-Team &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496105/governance-als-losung-genai-zwischen-akzeptanz-und-verbot.html" target="_blank" title="diskutieren"&gt;diskutieren&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn die Führungskräfte nicht wissen, welche KI wo verwendet wird, kommt der Bottom-up-Ansatz ins Spiel: Alle Endpunkte im Unternehmen werden getrackt, um die Systeme und Benutzer zu finden, die auf KI-Anwendungen zugreifen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das stelle keine perfekte Lösung dar, gibt die Beraterin zu: “Es gibt immer noch Dinge, die unter den Tisch fallen. Aber an dieser Stelle kommt der Aspekt einer gründlichen Schulung beziehungsweise Weiterbildung ins Spiel, um Mitarbeiter vor selbstverschuldeten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3577944/diese-unternehmen-hats-schon-erwischt.html" target="_blank" title="Dummheiten"&gt;Dummheiten&lt;/a&gt; zu bewahren.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Eigene AI Deployment Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen sollten auch ein Framework dafür aufsetzen, wie KI-Modelle im Sinne ihrer jeweiligen Compliance-Umgebung und Risikotoleranz eingesetzt werden. So könnten etwa einige Anwendungsfälle erfordern, dass sämtliche KI-Outputs manuell überprüft werden müssen. “Es gibt mehrere Risikodimensionen, die für generative KI relevant sind”, erklärt Iragavarapu. “Wie viele Menschen sind davon betroffen? Wie groß ist der Impact?” AArete arbeitet mit einigen Unternehmen zusammen, um sie dabei zu unterstützen, diese Risiken zu messen. Für einige Branchen existieren auch bereits erste Generative-AI-Risiko-Benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Bereich, auf den sich jetzt diverse Beratungsunternehmen konzentrieren – Ernst &amp;amp; Young zum Beispiel hat einen “&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ai/platform/our-approach" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Confidence Index"&gt;AI Confidence Index&lt;/a&gt;” entwickelt. Kapish Vanvaria, Risk Markets Leader bei EY Americas, erklärt, was es damit auf sich hat: “Unser Vertrauensindex basiert auf fünf Kriterien – Datenschutz und Sicherheit, Bias und Fairness, Verlässlichkeit, Transparenz und Erklärbarkeit und schließlich die Verantwortlichkeit. Das ist die eine Achse des Indexes. Die andere umfasst Compliance und ethische Grundsätze. So lässt sich eine Heatmap der verschiedenen Prozesse erstellen und eine gewichtete Bewertungsmethode auf jeden einzelnen anwenden.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich Recht und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496124/cloud-security-journey-wie-compliance-bei-accenture-geht.html" target="_blank" title="Compliance"&gt;Compliance&lt;/a&gt; seien diese Berechnungen relativ einfach, weil sie auf Scoring-Werten basierten. In anderen gebe es hingegen mehr Ermessensspielraum, so der EY-Entscheider: “Ein Unternehmen könnte beispielsweise den Reifegrad anhand von Faktoren wie einer Richtlinie zur akzeptablen KI-Nutzung bewerten. Sie können numerische Punktzahlen anwenden, um die Grundlinien zu messen, und wenn sich das Ziel verändert entsprechende Änderungen vornehmen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="drittanbieter-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Drittanbieter-KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsprobleme in Zusammenhang mit Drittanbieter-Services sind &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492170/third-party-risk-management-5-wege-mit-drittanbietern-unterzugehen.html" target="_blank" title="nicht neu"&gt;nicht neu&lt;/a&gt;. Potenziell könnte jeder Anbieter – egal, ob es um E-Mail-, Marketing- oder Daten-Services geht – Zugriff auf sensible Daten haben und diese unter Umständen sogar an seine jeweiligen Partner weitergeben. Risiken dieser Art zu minimieren, war schon vor Generative AI eine Herausforderung für Unternehmen – jetzt haben die Sicherheitsentscheider und ihre Teams gar keine andere Wahl mehr, als &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494219/chatgpt-und-co-was-cisos-beim-einsatz-von-genai-beachten-sollten.html" target="_blank" title="wachsam zu sein"&gt;wachsam zu sein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schließlich könnten Tools, die bislang nicht als Sicherheitsrisiko galten, etwa für die Bildbearbeitung, inzwischen über GenAI-Funktionalitäten verfügen – die hochgeladenen Informationen also bei einer KI landen. Um das zu verhindern, müssen in erster Linie sämtliche Verträge und Nutzungsbedingungen genau studiert und im Auge behalten werden. Darüber hinaus kann ein dediziertes Risikomanagement-Team für Drittanbieter dazu beitragen, Risiken zu minimieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Notch, CISO beim Security-Anbieter Expel, hat noch einen Tipp auf Lager, wenn es darum geht, die Zeichen am Horizont zu deuten: “Wenn ein Anbieter intern neue KI-Funktionen entwickelt, kann eine Änderung seiner Datenschutzrichtlinie ein erster Hinweis darauf sein. Bleiben Sie wachsam!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesem Zusammenhang entfaltet auch die europäische Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) positive Wirkung. Sie verpflichtet Anbieter dazu, offenzulegen, wenn sie mit Subunternehmern zusammenarbeiten. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="externe-ki-bedrohungen-bewerten"&gt;Externe KI-Bedrohungen bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative KI wird längst auch zu unlauteren Zwecken genutzt, etwa um &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495991/google-prognose-2024-genai-verstarkt-phishing-kampagnen.html" target="_blank" title="(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren"&gt;(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren&lt;/a&gt;. Das stellt die Sicherheitsteams in Unternehmen zunehmend vor Probleme, wie CISO Notch konstatiert: “Jede Organisation will sich vor Business E-Mail Compromise schützen. Allerdings sind die Indikatoren dafür, dass es sich um eine nicht koschere E-Mail handelt, sowohl für Menschen als auch für Maschinen immer schwieriger zu erkennen. Künstliche Intelligenz ist in der Lage, E-Mails und Webseiten nahezu perfekt zu fälschen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perys Arbeitgeber Abbyy arbeitet deswegen gezielt mit Sicherheitsanbietern zusammen, die sich auf GenAI-Bedrohungen spezialisiert haben. Dennoch sind die KI-Risiken schwer zu quantifizieren. An dieser Stelle sollen künftig neue Frameworks Abhilfe schaffen – etwa die vom Cybersecurity-Experten Daniel Miessler 2023 veröffentlichte “&lt;a href="https://danielmiessler.com/p/the-ai-attack-surface-map-v1-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Attack Surface Map"&gt;AI Attack Surface Map&lt;/a&gt;“. Sasa Zdjelar, Chief Trust Officer beim Supply-Chain-Spezialisten ReversingLabs, rechnet damit, dass demnächst auch größere Organisationen nachziehen: “CISA, NIST, die Cloud Security Alliance, ENISA und andere werden spezielle Task Forces bilden, die sich mit diesen neuen Bedrohungen befassen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bis es soweit ist, können Unternehmen prüfen, wie gut sie die Grundlagen beherrschen. Dazu gehört beispielsweise, zu überprüfen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle Endpunkte geschützt sind;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle User Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung nutzen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie gut die Mitarbeiter Phishing-Versuche erkennen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie groß der Rückstand in Sachen Patching ist;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;zu welchem Grad &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank" title="Zero-Trust-Prinzipien"&gt;Zero-Trust-Prinzipien&lt;/a&gt; die IT-Umgebung abdecken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese grundlegenden Hygienemaßnahmen können leicht unter den Tisch fallen, wenn neue Bedrohungen auftauchen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus können Firmen auch hinsichtlich neuer und aufkeimender Threats tätig werden, wie Sean Loveland, COO vom Sicherheitsanbieter Resecurity, nahelegt: “Offensive Cyber Threat Intelligence und KI-spezifisches Threat Monitoring können Informationen über neue Angriffsmethoden und Schwachstellen liefern sowie darüber, wie diese monetarisiert werden. Es gibt zum Beispiel ein Produkt namens ‘FraudGPT’, das über das Dark Web und Telegram vertrieben wird.” Dass kriminelle Hacker KI-Tools inzwischen&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492536/chatgpt-wie-cybergangster-generative-ai-nutzen.html" target="_blank" title=" in erheblichem Umfang nutzen"&gt; in erheblichem Umfang nutzen&lt;/a&gt;, kann auch Greg Stewart, Vice President Artificial Intelligence bei SentinelOne, bestätigen: “Wir beobachten eine starke Zunahme von adaptiver und polymorpher Malware, die sich autonom verbreitet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Davon abgesehen ist GenAI jedoch auch in der Lage, das Angriffsvolumen drastisch zu steigern. Das Weltwirtschaftsforum identifiziert in seinem “&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Global Risks Report 2024"&gt;Global Risks Report&lt;/a&gt;” ein weiteres, erhebliches Risiko für Unternehmen: KI-generierte Fehl- und Desinformationen. Schließlich können sich entsprechende Fake News schnell drastisch auf den Aktienkurs eines Unternehmens auswirken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="risikobehaftete-aussichten"&gt;Risikobehaftete Aussichten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unternehmen müssen sich darauf konzentrieren, einen ganzheitlichen Plan zu erstellen, um den Stand der generativen KI in ihrem Unternehmen zu bewerten”, hält Paul Silverglate, Technology Leader bei Deloitte USA, fest. Er ergänzt: “Sie müssen zeigen, dass es für das Unternehmen wichtig ist, es richtig zu machen und darauf vorbereitet zu sein, schnell zu reagieren und Abhilfe zu schaffen, falls etwas passiert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie wahrscheinlich es ist, dass das genau so und zeitnah passiert, ist mit Blick auf eine &lt;a href="https://riskonnect.com/reports/new-generation-of-risk-ahead-of-the-curve-or-behind-the-pack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Riskonnect-Survey"&gt;Riskonnect-Survey&lt;/a&gt; unter 300 Risiko- und Compliance-Entscheidern fraglich:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;93 Prozent der Unternehmen rechnen mit erheblichen Bedrohungen im Zusammenhang mit generativer KI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennoch geben nur 17 Prozent der Teilnehmer an, das gesamte Unternehmen in Bezug auf GenAI-Risiken geschult oder informiert zu haben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lediglich neun Prozent sind nach eigenen Angaben darauf vorbereitet, diese Risiken zu managen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine ähnlich gelagerte ISACA-Umfrage unter mehr als 2.300 Fachleuten aus den Bereichen Audit, Risiko, Sicherheit, Datenschutz und IT-Governance kommt darüber hinaus zum Ergebnis, dass lediglich zehn Prozent der Befragten über eine umfassende &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494657/windows-sicherheit-meets-generative-ai-sind-ihre-richtlinien-schon-ki-ready.html" target="_blank" title="Generative-AI-Richtlinie"&gt;Generative-AI-Richtlinie&lt;/a&gt; verfügen. Noch schlimmer: Mehr als ein Viertel der Befragten plant auch nicht, eine solche zu entwickeln. Gravierende Fehler, wie Silvergate erklärt: “Trust ist &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495889/verbesserungswurdige-compliance-masnahmen-generative-ai-konnte-das-vertrauen-der-kunden-untergraben.html" target="_blank" title="der heilige Gral"&gt;der heilige Gral&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn Sie das Vertrauen ihrer Kunden verlieren, wird es sehr schwer zurückzugewinnen sein.” (fm)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selling to the CISO: An open letter to the cybersecurity industry</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089738/selling-to-the-ciso-an-open-letter-to-the-cybersecurity-industry.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity market has lost its mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It seems like every week a new vendor appears, investors throw money at half-baked ideas, and CISOs get buried in pitches for products that won’t stop the next breach. The noise keeps getting louder while the fundamentals stay ignored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these products don’t even look impressive in a demo. I sit through presentations and wonder why they exist. They promise to “redefine security” but can’t even explain what problem they’re solving. They’re built for funding rounds, not production. They’re answers to questions nobody asked. Meanwhile, the same core vulnerabilities keep wrecking companies year after year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vendors think they’re selling technology. They’re not. They’re trying to sell confidence to people whose &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4016334/has-ciso-become-the-least-desirable-role-in-business.html"&gt;jobs depend on managing the impossible&lt;/a&gt;. As a CISO, I buy because I’m trying to reduce the odds that something catastrophic happens on my watch. Every decision is a gamble. There is no “safe” option in this field. I buy to reduce personal and organizational risk, knowing there’s no such thing as perfect protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is not a puzzle you solve. It’s a game you play — and it never ends. You make the best moves you can, knowing you’ll never win. Even if I somehow patched every system and closed every gap, the cost of perfection would cripple the company. We could make ourselves completely secure tomorrow if we were willing to stop shipping product, serving customers, and generating revenue. But that isn’t security anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The job is to keep the company running without letting it burn down. That means I don’t just care about uptime. I care about not having the breach that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3846318/6-hard-earned-tips-for-leading-through-a-cyberattack-from-csos-whove-been-there.html"&gt;defines the next year of my life&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about balance. Too much risk and you’re in the headlines. Too much control and you kill innovation. Every day in this role is a negotiation between the two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I buy very selectively. I buy what fits the roadmap, what measurably reduces risk, what integrates cleanly, and what my team can sustain. I buy visibility because you can’t defend what you can’t see. I buy identity because access is where real control lives. I buy automation that makes people faster, not dumber. And I buy tools that make secure-by-design real, not theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What I don’t buy is hype. I don’t buy tools that overlap with three others. I don’t buy anything that looks good in a slide deck but fails in the real world. I don’t buy complexity that makes the team’s job harder. And I don’t buy from anyone who can’t explain in clear, human language what problem they’re solving and how it actually reduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="its-all-about-the-fundamentals"&gt;It’s all about the fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The truth is that most organizations don’t need more tools. They need to get the fundamentals right. If you can patch consistently, maintain good access controls, and segment your networks so you aren’t running flat, you’re ahead of most of the market — no shiny tools required. Strong patching alone will eliminate most of the attack surface that vendors keep promising to “detect.” Network segmentation prevents lateral movement. Access control limits blast radius. These aren’t new ideas. They’re old, proven, and neglected because they don’t sound exciting enough for investors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s the problem. The industry has stopped rewarding what works. It rewards what sells. Venture capital keeps throwing money at “AI-powered” and “autonomous” everything while the basics rot. Vendors chase hype because hype gets funding. CISOs buy hype because we’re desperate for something that will finally make the pain stop. The cycle feeds itself. Everyone’s rational, but the result is insane.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can’t blame vendors alone. We created the market they’re serving. We bought into the illusion that innovation equals progress. We ignored the fundamentals because they’re hard and unglamorous. We filled our environments with products we couldn’t fully use and called it maturity. We built complexity and called it strategy. Then we act shocked when the same root causes keep taking us down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good security still starts with good IT. Always has. Always will. If you don’t know what you own, you can’t protect it. If you don’t patch it, it’s already compromised. If you give excessive access or run a flat network, you’re one compromised credential away from a crisis. The solutions exist. They’re just not exciting. They require patience, process, and persistence, which are the three things this industry avoids because they don’t photograph well at RSA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="looking-for-reliability-not-revolution"&gt;Looking for reliability, not revolution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m not anti-technology. I rely on it. But I buy it with purpose. I buy tools that make us better at the basics, that help enforce discipline, and that reduce human error. I buy solutions that simplify, not complicate. And I buy from vendors who tell me the truth, even when it’s inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good vendors understand this. They know they’re not selling revolution. They’re selling reliability. They show up prepared. They understand my business, they know where their solution fits, and they’re honest about what it can and can’t do. They know I’m not looking for magic. I’m looking for help managing a problem that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investors need to take responsibility, too. Stop funding vaporware. Stop chasing the next acronym. Fund the boring but critical work: visibility, identity, secure configuration, developer enablement, and IT hygiene. That’s what actually keeps companies out of the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And CISOs, we have to stop pretending we’re victims in this. We’re not. We built this market with our buying habits. We rewarded noise. We chased innovation that didn’t align with our maturity. If we want the industry to change, we have to change how we spend. Buy less. Buy smarter. Invest in people, process, and architecture before you buy another platform. If you can’t patch, if you can’t control access, if your network is still flat, you don’t need another tool. You need discipline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security is not a tech problem. It’s an execution problem. And until we fix that, no amount of funding, AI, or new categories will save us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ll keep buying what matters. I’ll buy what reduces real risk and strengthens the foundation. I’ll buy what makes us harder to breach and easier to recover. But everything else, the noise, the hype, the endless stream of tools that don’t fix the real issues, can stay on the shelf (or in your PowerPoint slides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>3 ways CISOs can win over their boards this budget season</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093058/3-ways-cisos-can-win-over-their-boards-this-budget-season.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the year comes to a close, CISOs are already deep into building next year’s cybersecurity budget. That’s a difficult task in itself — yet the most challenging part of the process is getting the board’s approval. CISOs know all too well that getting a cybersecurity budget approved can be like trying to explain AP English to a dog: you’re just speaking different languages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern CISOs are charged with protecting their organization from rapidly evolving threats while cybersecurity budgets are shrinking or getting redistributed. Boards still tend to see cybersecurity as a cost center, not something that can increase efficiency within their business. CISOs know the truth, but they need to figure out how to communicate the value of cybersecurity in a language their board can understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are three tips to win over your board this budgeting season. Done correctly, you’ll have a better chance of securing your budget and making your organization more resilient in a fast-moving threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-1-quantify-risk"&gt;Tip 1: Quantify risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first step in building a defensible budget is putting numbers on the risks you’re trying to control. As a CISO, you immediately understand that your organization needs things like enhanced endpoint detection, a zero-trust architecture and a proper security operations center, but when you bring those things up in the budget meeting, the board’s eyes glaze over. It’s not that they are dismissing cybersecurity — they just don’t understand how these technical investments connect to the business outcomes they care about.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why you should use financial terms to quantify your organization’s value at risk. Boards are more likely to accept your budget if they can understand the financial implications of a breach. Of course, this can be a difficult task if you haven’t experienced a breach before. You can start to understand your risk surface by researching your industry’s most common threats and breaches, consulting threat intelligence sources and interrogating your vendors’ cybersecurity postures to understand your third-party risk. You can also gather probability data on a breach through industry reports, government statistics and historical internal incident data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the most accurate and influential approach is to survey your own experts and stakeholders, including them in the quantification process. You can find tools to do this manually or automatically. Using either approach, you can calculate the overall business impact of your risk, including direct financial losses, business interruptions and long-term business and reputation effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an example of what this looks like in practice, take the recent &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/21/what-we-know-about-the-cyberattack-that-hit-major-european-airports.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Collins Aerospace breach&lt;/a&gt;, which caused heavy disruption and flight cancellations at multiple European airports. Not only were there direct financial losses for affected organizations, but there were also opportunity costs and lost efficiencies: increased engineering hours to get systems back online, pen and paper solutions on the ground to replace automated tasks, and overworked airport staff. Use these atomic, costly events to have the conversation with your CFO on modeling financial impact, imagining if your organization had been affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a dismal scenario for most organizations, but one that your board should understand the full implications of. When quantifying the risks to your board, you should be prepared to explain the impacts of a worst-case scenario, best-case scenario and most-likely scenario — all in terms of financial losses. Quantifying the full scope of the cascading effects of a breach will help non-technical executives understand the investment required to make your organization resilient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-2-go-beyond-compliance-standards"&gt;Tip 2: Go beyond compliance standards&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that compliance and regulations drive &lt;a href="https://www.hitchpartners.com/ciso-security-leadership-survey-results-25" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 80% of CISOs’ budget justifications&lt;/a&gt;. Industry standards like HIPAA and SOC2 can offer a guiding framework for a program, but with evolving threats from AI, the rise of quantum computing and increasingly complex third-party risk, CISOs need to think of the threats that compliance doesn’t necessarily mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can, aim for 10% or more of your budget to be allocated to non-compliance risks for a 3-5-year horizon. These double-digit percentages are aspirational; &lt;a href="https://www.iansresearch.com/resources/ians-security-budget-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the average CISO has a 3% discretionary budget&lt;/a&gt;. This budget does not have to be all net-new spend. For example, generative AI risks are top of mind for CISOs and boards, but dedicated, off-the-shelf tooling is in its very early stages. Existing budget line items, such as Data Security Posture Management, SASE and GRC analyst hours, can decrease risk from threats to generative AI workloads and tooling. Increased investment in these technologies and processes, alongside new ones, builds a solid foundation for your company to efficiently leverage Generative AI on a medium-term horizon and &lt;em&gt;limit &lt;/em&gt;net new spending on point solutions. These investments lay the groundwork for your company to scale securely ahead of your competitors, rather than jumping into &lt;a href="https://cyberresilience.com/threatonomics/how-to-avoid-ai-fomo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI FOMO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your board wants to know that you are thinking about the emerging risks and how to address them in your budget proactively. You may not have all of the data on a given risk, but you should still acknowledge it and help the board understand the likelihood of it impacting your organization. As the threat landscape evolves, so should your strategies for making your organization resilient to those risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tip-3-know-thy-board"&gt;Tip 3: Know thy board&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Part of winning over your board has to do with knowing what kind of persuasion tactics drive their decision-making. Boards are getting smarter on cybersecurity; a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nacdonline.org/all-governance/governance-resources/governance-surveys/surveys-benchmarking/2025-public-company-board-practices--oversight-survey/2025-board-practices-oversight-cybersecurity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NACD survey&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 80% of boards’ cybersecurity knowledge has improved. Another survey found &lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/board-matters/cyber-disclosure-trends" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85%&lt;/a&gt; of companies reported that they either have or are looking for a board member with cybersecurity expertise. Now that boards have a better awareness of the importance of cybersecurity, it’s your turn to meet them halfway and understand what they value from a business perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some boards are laser-focused on financial metrics and will only look at the dollars and cents of the budget. In that case, it’s essential to communicate in financial terms; they’ll want concrete examples of what the organization stands to lose from the cost of breach-related business interruption. This quantification does more than just justify your budget; it creates a bridge between your security team and business imperatives. Other boards may be more motivated by storytelling. In that case, painting a step-by-step picture of what an attack could look like and the corresponding impacts that go along with it will be most compelling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both instances, the budget and conversation defending it should speak the same language as your specific board. Importantly, that level of insight into what the board values can only come from consistent check-ins throughout the year. You should strive to build a relationship, so you aren’t simply a checkbox for the board come budgeting season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should bring rigor, clarity and business alignment to security investment decisions. If you can quantify the risks for your board, accounting for emerging risks and understand what they value the most, you’ll better your odds to win over your board this fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sneaky2FA phishing tool adds ability to insert legit-looking URLs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094165/sneaky2fa-phishing-tool-adds-ability-to-insert-legit-looking-urls.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the introduction of multi-factor authentication (MFA), threat actors have been finding ways to get around what can be an effective defense against phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their latest move, those behind the Sneaky2FA phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kit have added browser-in-the-browser (BITB) functionality to help crooks design phishing pages that fool victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function allows the crook to embed a browser window on the victim’s desktop containing a phishing page that includes a URL address bar that can be customized by the attacker to look like a legitimate address to, for example, Microsoft online. BITB differs from attacker-in-the-middle (AITM) attacks, where the threat actor creates an embedded browser window that contains the actual phishing page. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Employees trained to look for suspicious URLs might even be fooled, because the internet address looks real. However,  the pop-up window, enabled through a reverse proxy, contains an iframe pointing to a malicious server that captures credentials and MFA codes entered by the unwitting victim. Then the attacker can steal the live session of the account being targeted, as well as user credentials, by logging in in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-warning-to-csos"&gt;A warning to CSOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report this week &lt;a href="https://pushsecurity.com/blog/analyzing-the-latest-sneaky2fa-phishing-page/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from researchers at Push Security &lt;/a&gt;describing the Sneaky2FA browser-in-the-browser capability is a warning to CSOs that they have to adapt their employee security awareness training as well as their defensive technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BITB tactics are spreading, says the report. It notes that Raccoon0365 was another PhaaS service that has utilized BITB functionality after announcing a ‘BITB mini-panel’ would be added to its offerings. In September, Cloudflare and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4058634/microsoft-and-cloudflare-execute-rugpull-on-massive-phishing-empire.html" target="_blank"&gt;dismantled that gang’s IT infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BITB has been known as a concept since 2022, notes David Shipley, head of Canadian-based security awareness training firm Beauceron Security. In fact, he added, it is increasingly used by advanced red teams in penetration tests to defeat security controls like MFA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It hasn’t been widely used because it hasn’t been needed to get the job done when it comes to compromising organizations,” he said. But as defenses improve, he’s seen use of this technique increase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s dangerous, he said, is that phishing-as-a-service tools are making it easier for entry-level criminals to use these more advanced techniques. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is why I’ve always hated it when people use language like ‘phishing resistant,’ or even worse, ‘phishing proof’ solutions. Additional identity controls like MFA add more friction and resiliency, but can still be bypassed by clever attackers. That’s why it’s critical organizations have both robust technology security control as well as an aware community.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means CSOs and infosec leaders have to do more than just annual compliance-driven security training, Shipley said, instead motivating employees to keep an eye out for unusual things in messaging so they spot and stop phishing and other cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s where many organizations are struggling,” he said. “Not in instructing people or passing on knowledge, but in creating a security culture that motivates people to apply knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570795/how-to-hack-2fa.html" target="_blank"&gt;Related content: How MFA gets hacked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The addition of BITB, along with the improvement of detection evasion techniques, means that traditional security controls such as email gateways, web filters, and signature-based defenses will continue to be reliably bypassed, Push Security’s report says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-look-at-sneaky2fa"&gt;A look at Sneaky2FA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sneaky2FA operates through a full-featured bot on Telegram, says the report. Customers reportedly receive access to a licensed, obfuscated version of the source code and deploy it independently. This means they can customize it to their needs. On the other hand, the report notes, Sneaky2FA implementations can be reliably profiled and tracked due to the codebase similarities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sneaky2FA has been frequently seen using anti-analysis techniques to detect or disable browser developer tools so they can block attempts to analyze the page for malicious content, the report adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Defenders should note that the HTML and JavaScript of Sneaky2FA pages are heavily obfuscated to evade static detection and pattern-matching, the report says. This includes using tactics such as breaking up UI text with invisible tags, embedding background and interface elements as encoded images instead of text, and other changes that are invisible to the user, but make it hard for scanning tools to fingerprint the page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Campaigns are also known to use a ‘burn-and-replace’ tactic, hiding behind a fresh, long, randomized URL that lies dormant or serves harmless content until right before the attack, and then quickly vanishes. This is to defeat domain reputation or pattern-matching defense technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-game-of-cat-and-mouse"&gt;A game of cat and mouse&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-g-/"&gt;Dan Green&lt;/a&gt;, author of the Push Security report, told &lt;em&gt;CSO &lt;/em&gt;in an email that email isn’t the only way BITB attacks are spreading. In the past several months, his firm has seen LinkedIn Messenger and Google Search being used as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We would encourage security teams to re-evaluate how they approach phishing detection,” he said. “[Phishing] is becoming increasingly sophisticated, it’s no longer just an email problem, and the risks are significant. A compromised enterprise cloud account (for example, Microsoft or Google Workspace) is effectively the key to everything you access in the course of the modern workday. This isn’t just the direct access to your enterprise cloud suite, but the downstream application access via SSO (single sign-on) that can be hijacked by the attacker. Most breaches start with compromised identities today, compared with software exploits or malware execution.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/author/roger-grimes"&gt;Roger Grimes&lt;/a&gt;, data driven defense CISO advisor at security awareness training provider KnowBe4, noted that browser vendors have worked for decades trying to prevent malicious popup boxes from appearing because they are so tricky. However, he added, criminals keep on figuring out ways to bypass the protections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, he added, it is getting ever harder for criminals to create malicious popup boxes. Users still have a chance to see what is happening if they are aware, he said. “Sadly,” he said, “a large percentage of users don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Educating users by providing information and examples of how browser pop-up attacks work is key, he said. In addition, CSOs should make sure browsers used by employees are as well configured as they can be to prevent these types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Browser vendors will respond and close the holes, but it’s always a reactive game of cat-and-mouse with the defenders always behind.” he said. “Pretty soon AI-enabled defense tools will do a better job at preventing them from happening at all. We just have to cover the gap for now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>So rechtfertigen Sie Ihre Security-Investitionen</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4051211/so-rechtfertigen-sie-ihre-security-investitionen.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Investitionen" class="wp-image-4051223" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2544942275.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lesen Sie, welche Aspekte entscheidend sind, um die Investitionen in die Cybersicherheit im Unternehmen zu rechtfertigen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Miha Creative – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In modernen Unternehmensumgebungen werden Investitionen in Sicherheitstechnologien nicht mehr nur anhand ihres technischen Reifegrades beurteilt. Die Finanzierung hängt vermehrt davon ab, inwieweit sich damit Umsatz generieren lässt, Risiken gemindert und Mehrwerte für Aktionäre geschaffen werden. Von CISOs wird erwartet, dass sie ihre Strategien nicht als technische Upgrades, sondern als Wegbereiter für Umsatzsteigerungen präsentieren. Die Herausforderung besteht dabei nicht nur darin, die richtigen Investitionsentscheidungen zu treffen, sondern diese auch auf Vorstandsebene zu rechtfertigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Am Anfang muss die Herausforderung stehen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs geraten oft in Erklärungsnot, wenn sie Lösungen präsentieren, bevor die Herausforderung definiert ist. Ein solches Vorgehen schafft Distanz anstelle von Übereinstimmung. Vorstände wollen verstehen, was ihre Organisation mit einem neuen Lösungsansatz erreichen kann, welche Fallstricke vermieden werden und warum Cybersecurity-Investitionen nicht aufschiebbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bei der Präsentation einer Cybersicherheitsstrategie wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt; sollte deshalb der Kommunikationsschwerpunkt mit dem Vorstand darauf liegen, wie das Cyberrisiko-Profil des Unternehmens zum Positiven verändert werden kann.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technologie mit strategischen Prioritäten verknüpfen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um in der Vorstandsetage glaubwürdig zu sein, müssen CISOs ihre geplanten Ausgaben anhand der Unternehmenszielsetzung definieren. Der Vorstand konzentriert sich auf Prioritäten wie neue Märkte zu erschließen, die Margen zu verbessern, die Widerstandsfähigkeit zu steigern und die Compliance zu gewährleisten. Ein gut durchdachter Vorschlag knüpft direkt an diese Anliegen an.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn eine Sicherheitsplattform die Reaktionszeit bei Vorfällen verkürzt, ist das Ergebnis operative Stabilität und damit eine höhere &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4004443/operationelle-resilienz-koordination-kooperation-im-fokus.html" target="_blank"&gt;Resilienz&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn sie Tools konsolidiert, sorgt sie für Kosteneffizienz. Wenn sie eine sichere Expansion in neue Regionen ermöglicht, ist Umsatzwachstum die Folge. Eine solche Argumentationskette schafft Glaubwürdigkeit und hilft dabei, Investitionen bewilligt zu bekommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eine Sprache für Risiken und Rendite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vorstände treffen Entscheidungen unter der Berücksichtigung von Begrifflichkeiten wie Risiko und Rendite. Dazu gehören finanzielle Risiken, operative Risiken und Reputationsrisiken für das Unternehmen. Vorstandsmitglieder bewerten Wahrscheinlichkeit, Exposition und Auswirkungen von Vorfällen in jedem dieser Bereiche. Dementsprechend besteht die Aufgabe des CISOs darin, zu verdeutlichen, wie eine vorgeschlagene Investition Schwachstellen reduziert, Auswirkungen von Vorfällen begrenzt oder die Resilienz der Infrastruktur erhöht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Gespräche sollten Kostenmodelle, Szenarien für mögliche Sicherheitsverletzungen, Zeitpläne für die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495970/die-besten-cyber-recovery-anbieter.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wiederherstellung nach einem Cyberangriff&lt;/a&gt; und den geschäftlichen Nutzen aufzeigen. Das Ziel sollte sein, Ausfallzeiten zu vermeiden und dabei die Sprache der Vorstände zu sprechen, ohne die technische Integrität zu vernachlässigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shareholder Value bedenken&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Reifegrad und auch die Denkweisen von Vorständen in Bezug auf die Cybersicherheit variieren deutlich. Einige Kontrollgremien reagieren erst nach einem größeren Cybervorfall oder einem nicht bestandenen Audit. Andere sind sehr viel proaktiver in ihrer Vorgehensweise und fordern Cybersicherheitsbewertungen als Teil ihrer Marktexpansion oder M&amp;amp;A-Aktivitäten. Andere beziehen Cybersicherheit in Simulationen ein und stellen zukunftsorientierte Fragen zur Widerstandsfähigkeit angesichts potenzieller Angriffsszenarien.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Verständnis dieses Reifegrades hilft dabei, die Kommunikationsstrategie anzupassen. Ein reaktiver Vorstand benötigt möglicherweise eine klare Erklärung der negativen Folgen. Ein informierter Vorstand erwartet eher quantifizierbare Ergebnisse und eine Roadmap. Die besten Vorstandsdiskussionen finden statt, wenn sich der CISO an das Technologieverständnis des Vorstands anpasst und gleichzeitig dessen Perspektive behutsam erweitert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesetipp: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492322/cybersecurity-messen-10-kennzahlen-die-cisos-weiterbringen.html" target="_blank"&gt;10 Kennzahlen, die CISOs weiterbringen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operative Exzellenz als Ergebnis positionieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eines der wirksamsten Argumente in den Gesprächen mit dem Vorstand zum Thema Cybersicherheit ist operative Exzellenz. Wenn Unternehmen in unterschiedlichen Regionen und Branchen tätig sind, müssen sie agil, abgesichert und kontrolliert arbeiten. Eine IT-Architektur sollte&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;globale Anforderungen adressieren und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;dabei Mitarbeitende unterstützen, die von überall aus arbeiten,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Drittparteien integrieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;eine Reihe von regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;geistiges Eigentum schützen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein derart umfangreiches Anforderungsprofil kann sehr schnell zu einer komplexen Umsetzung und dadurch zu Ineffizienzen führen. CISOs setzen mit einer starken Technologiestrategie auf eine vereinfachte Infrastruktur, ermöglichen sichere globale Datenflüsse und verkürzen Markteintrittszeiten. Eine solche Positionierung hebt die Diskussion von der Systemauswahl auf eine strategische Ebene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zukünftige Risiken im Fokus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Von einem Vorstand wird erwartet, dass er sich nicht nur auf aktuelle Risiken konzentriert, sondern auch auf zukünftige Szenarien. Dazu gehören beispielsweise die Regulierung der ethischen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030328/so-verandert-ki-ihre-grc-strategie.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nutzung von KI&lt;/a&gt;, das Verständnis der Auswirkungen von Datenmissbrauch und die Vorbereitung auf die Auswirkungen des Quantencomputings. Der Vorstand wird für den sicheren und regulierten Umgang mit Daten verantwortlich und sogar haftbar gemacht. Dies sind keine abstrakten Themen mehr. Deshalb sollten sie bereits jetzt als künftige technologische Herausforderungen auf der CISO-Agenda stehen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Nutzung von KI hat in Unternehmen zugenommen und Vorstände haben für die Verwendung von Daten geradezustehen. Quantencomputing ist zwar noch im Anfangsstadium, aber das Risiko der zukünftigen Technologie für heutige Verschlüsselungen macht es schon jetzt zu einem notwendigen Bestandteil jeder langfristigen Planung. Viele CISOs nutzen die Chance bereits, das Thema beim Vorstand zu positionieren und zu erklären, welche Maßnahmen in absehbarer Zukunft zum Schutz der Daten erforderlich sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Die Macht der Zahlen&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die finanzielle Ausgestaltung ist genauso wichtig wie die strategische Vorgehensweise. Da immer mehr Unternehmen von hardwareintensiven Architekturen zu Cloud-nativen SaaS- Modellen übergehen, verändert sich die Wirtschaftlichkeit der Sicherheit. Die Kosten verlagern sich von Kapitalausgaben zu Betriebsausgaben. Dies kann zwar zunächst zu einer Verringerung des EBITDA (betriebswirtschaftliche Kennzahl/Earnings Before Interest,Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) führen, eliminiert jedoch auch Hardware-Erneuerungszyklen, verbessert die Prognosegenauigkeit und senkt die langfristigen Gesamtbetriebskosten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abrechnungsmodelle pro User für Cloud-Services sorgen für Vorhersehbarkeit und höhere Flexibilität als Reaktion auf Veränderungen. Weiteres Einsparpotenzial besteht in der Konsolidierung von Tools auf wenige Plattformanbieter. Zusätzlich kann die Automatisierung von Prozessen den Service Desk entlasten und die Produktivität verbessern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztlich sollten CISOs aufzeigen, wie potenzielle Investitionen in neue Technologien den Cashflow verbessern, Margen sichern und mit dem Unternehmenswachstum skalieren. CFOs und Prüfungsausschüsse möchten wissen, wie sich jeder Vorschlag auf die Finanzergebnisse auswirkt. Sie möchten auch verstehen, was kapitalisiert werden kann, welche Ausgleichseffekte zu erwarten sind und wie sich die Investitionen mit der Nachfrage entwickeln werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fazit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztendlich geht es bei der Rechtfertigung von Security-Investitionen nicht um Überzeugungsarbeit, sondern um Einflussnahme. Es geht darum, die Geschäftsprioritäten mit sicheren, skalierbaren und kostengünstigen Lösungen in Einklang zu bringen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dementsprechend müssen CISOs eine Strategie präsentieren, die Risiken reduziert, die Agilität verbessert und das Unternehmen für langfristigen Erfolg positioniert. Wenn die IT-Führungsriege die Sprache des Mehrwerts von Lösungsansätzen spricht, klingen ihre Vorschläge nicht mehr wie technische Anforderungen, sondern wie geschäftliche Notwendigkeiten. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Recognizing and responding to cyber threats: What differentiates NDR, EDR and XDR</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4091641/recognizing-and-responding-to-cyber-threats-what-differentiates-ndr-edr-and-xdr.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The constantly growing number of acronyms in cyber security makes it difficult to maintain an overview and compare individual technologies. One example is the three closely related technologies for threat detection: network detection and response (NDR), &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/568045/what-is-edr-endpoint-detection-and-response.html" target="_blank"&gt;endpoint detection and response&lt;/a&gt; (EDR) and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574295/11-top-xdr-tools-and-how-to-evaluate-them.html" target="_blank"&gt;extended detection and response&lt;/a&gt; (XDR). Each of them offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and responding to different cyberattacks. Although they are based on similar approaches, there are some differences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="edr-identifies-noticeable-changes-at-the-endpoint"&gt;EDR identifies noticeable changes at the endpoint&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;EDR, the oldest of the three detection technologies, monitors endpoints to mitigate attacks on them. Endpoints are network devices such as PCs, file servers, smartphones and IoT devices that connect to the network to communicate. A software agent is used to inventory EDR malware and suspicious activity detected on the endpoint, such as registry changes and key file tampering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As network environments become more complex over time and threat actors and malware become more sophisticated, EDR faces the following challenges:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Required EDR agents cannot be deployed on all devices or in all environments, leaving gaps in visibility and opening the door for attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common applications can bypass EDR. For example, Microsoft SQL Server has administrative access to the underlying Windows operating system without using any of the EDR-monitored environments mentioned above, allowing an attacker to bypass endpoint detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malware and attackers are becoming more sophisticated and are able to detect anti-malware software on the endpoint or hide evidence of endpoint compromise altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While EDR is a necessary component of a modern cybersecurity strategy, it cannot be used alone for comprehensive cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="xdr-offers-holistic-protection"&gt;XDR offers holistic protection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people mistakenly think of XDR as a product or an evolution of EDR. However, XDR is a strategy that consists of a combination of security-related telemetry data coupled with high-fidelity detection to enable faster and more effective incident response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are different types of XDR. There is a proprietary XDR strategy that focuses on a single vendor or an “all-in-one” platform that provides telemetry data from a vendor’s various products, for example, their firewalls, EDR, NDR and so on. There is also an open XDR strategy that consists of multiple vendors or “best-of-breed” technologies or tools. Here, telemetry data is provided by different product types (such as firewall, intrusion detection system [IDS], EDR and NDR) and vendors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations believe that an EDR-centric XDR strategy is sufficient, but this leads to a problematic blind spot. If the EDR agent overview is lost, there is no other way to find or investigate a potential critical security breach. With this single-point focused telemetry strategy, attackers only need to bypass one technology or defense to penetrate the network. Cybersecurity managers need to detect changes in network activity and compare it to endpoint and cloud data. This is where NDR solutions can provide the context needed to focus on potential cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading tip:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4012841/6-key-trends-redefining-the-xdr-market.html"&gt;6 key trends redefining the XDR market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ndr-detects-threats-at-packet-level-and-reacts-in-real-time"&gt;NDR detects threats at packet level and reacts in real time&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike EDR or XDR solutions, NDR focuses on analyzing packet data in network traffic to detect potential cyberthreats, rather than endpoints or other data streams. By combining NDR with other solutions such as log analysis tools via &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/524286/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html" target="_blank"&gt;security information and event management&lt;/a&gt; (SIEM) and EDR, organizations can mitigate blind spots in their networks. Together, NDR solutions increase security capabilities by providing network context and automating responses to threats, enabling better collaboration between network and IT security teams and faster mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in the context of NDR, it is important to differentiate the capabilities of advanced platforms that provide features that modern cybersecurity stacks should include. For example, when evaluating different NDRs, it is important to ensure that they offer reliable forensics with long-term data retention. It is also crucial that they do not rely on NetFlow-based data. These are not supported in all environments and offer opportunities for sophisticated tunneling-based attacks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced NDR systems should even provide a retrospective view of network traffic to examine threat behavior before, during and after attacks. So if an indicator of compromise (IOC) is detected, security teams can examine the compromised hosts’ communications, detect lateral movement and determine if a data breach has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="edr-xdr-ndr-together-they-are-strong"&gt;EDR, XDR, NDR: Together they are strong&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To summarize, EDRs are designed to monitor and mitigate attacks on endpoints via connected computers and servers. However, only where agents can be deployed. Therefore, EDR does not work in some cloud-based hosting environments, for example. In contrast, XDRs provide a more unified platform approach to monitoring devices and data streams, but often lack the network context that NDRs provide through real-time packet monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most large organizations today require a more comprehensive solution that combines network and endpoint data with other security solutions to provide a more robust, real-time view of the ever-changing threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced NDR solutions provide a high level of network intelligence and effectively complement the rest of the security stack. In addition to SIEM, an advanced NDR solution can also be integrated into &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3622920/soar-buyers-guide-11-security-orchestration-automation-and-response-products-and-how-to-choose.html" target="_blank"&gt;security orchestration, automation and response&lt;/a&gt; (SOAR) or firewall platforms to initiate immediate blocking at the network perimeter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all, it is impossible to cover your tracks on the network and cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Working together, these systems provide a complete overview of attacker behavior and indicators of compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advanced NDR makes an important contribution to the overall cyber security strategy and helps to minimize operational risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Ransomware gangs seize a new hostage: your AWS S3 buckets</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094475/ransomware-gangs-find-a-new-hostage-your-aws-s3-buckets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware operators are shifting their focus from traditional on-premises targets to cloud storage services, especially S3 buckets used by Amazon Web Services (AWS), cybersecurity researchers have warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent Trend Micro report outlined a new wave of attacks, where attackers integrate with cloud-native encryption and key management services rather than merely stealing or deleting data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Malicious activity targeting S3 buckets isn’t new, although the techniques continue to evolve as organizations harden their cloud environments,” said Crystal Morin, senior cybersecurity strategist at Sysdig. “As defenders adopt stronger perimeter protections, these attackers are starting to abuse built-in capabilities, such as encryption management and key rotation, to make data unrecoverable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Trend Micro, attackers are probing a range of S3 setups, from buckets with AWS-managed KMS keys to customer-provided keys, imported key material, and even entirely external key stores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-s3-is-the-new-ransomware-battleground"&gt;Why S3 is the new ransomware battleground&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On-premise ransomware traditionally involved dropping malware, encrypting desktops or servers, and threatening payment. But as organizations have migrated critical workloads and backups to cloud services, researchers noted, attackers are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4033018/ransomware-goes-cloud-native-to-target-your-backup-infrastructure.html"&gt;following the data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Trend Micro report lists several prime cloud targets, including compute snapshots, static storage (S3) buckets, databases, containers/registries, and backup vaults. Among these, S3 is especially valuable because it often holds backups, logs, configuration data, and static assets–things an organization most wants back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To succeed, attackers typically look for S3 buckets that have: versioning disabled ( so old versions can’t be restored), object-lock disabled ( so files can be overwritten or deleted), wide write permissions (via mis-configured IAM policies or leaked credentials), and hold high-value data (backup files, production config dumps).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once inside, the attackers try to impose a “complete and irreversible lockout” of data, which may involve encryption objects with keys inaccessible to the victim, deleting backups, and scheduling key deletion so AWS and the customer can’t recover the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This research is a systematic and theoretical threat modelling exercise on how an attacker might encrypt and ransom an AWS environment within an account boundary–something we’ve talked about over the last 10 years,” said Trey Ford, chief strategy and trust officer at Bugcrowd.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="weaponizing-cloud-encryption-and-key-management"&gt;Weaponizing cloud encryption and key management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trend Micro has &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/k/s3-ransomware.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; five S3 ransomware variants that increasingly exploit AWS’s built-in encryption paths. One abuses default AWS-managed KMS keys (SSE-KMS) by encrypting data with an attacker-created key and scheduling that key for deletion. Another uses customer-provided keys (SSE-C), where AWS has no copy, making recovery impossible. The third one exfiltrates S3 bucket data (with no versioning) and deletes the originals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final two variants go deeper into key management infrastructure. One relies on imported key material (&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-byok-bring-your-own-key-to-aws-kms-for-less-than-15-00-a-year-using-aws-cloudhsm/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BYOK&lt;/a&gt;), letting attackers encrypt data and then destroy or expire the imported keys. The other abuses AWS’s External Key Store (XKS), where key operations happen outside AWS, which means that if attackers control the external key source, neither the customer nor AWS can restore access. Together, the techniques reveal that attackers are using AWS itself as the encryption mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t recall having seen this done in the wild,” Ford added. “This specifically targets the use of external or customer-provided keys (SSE-C or XKS, respectively) to assert control over key management for the cryptography used in storage.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers urge customers to harden their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3816939/abandoned-aws-s3-buckets-open-door-to-remote-code-execution-and-supply-chain-compromises.html"&gt;S3 environments&lt;/a&gt; by enforcing least privilege access, enabling protective controls like versioning and Object Lock, and closely regulating the use of customer-provided or external key sources that can undermine recovery. Isolating backups in separate accounts and continuously monitoring cloud audit logs for signs of suspicious key activity, mass encryption, or large-scale object deletions was also recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“An ‘assume breach’ mindset is essential in the cloud: runtime environments should be immutable, identities must have tightly scoped permissions and short-lived credentials, networks need meaningful segmentation, and critical datasets must have backups,” Morin added. “Modern operations depend on complex supply chains, and a ransomware affecting a key partner can disrupt your business just as completely as a direct compromise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>OAuth token compromise hits Salesforce ecosystem again, Gainsight impacted</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094506/oauth-token-compromise-hits-salesforce-ecosystem-again-gainsight-impacted.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce has disclosed yet another security incident involving unauthorized access to customer data through compromised third-party applications, this time implicating Gainsight-published apps connected to its platform through OAuth integrations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce said it detected unusual activity involving Gainsight applications that integrate with its customer relationship management platform. “Upon detecting the activity, Salesforce revoked all active access and refresh tokens associated with Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce and temporarily removed those applications from the AppExchange while our investigation continues,” a Salesforce spokesperson told CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company emphasized that the issue does not stem from its platform. “There is no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” the spokesperson added. “The activity appears to be related to the app’s external connection to Salesforce.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gainsight-engages-mandiant-for-forensic-investigation"&gt;Gainsight engages Mandiant for forensic investigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gainsight confirmed the incident in &lt;a href="https://status.gainsight.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;status page updates&lt;/a&gt;, stating it has engaged Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm owned by Google Cloud, to assist in a comprehensive forensic investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our current findings indicate that the activity under investigation originated from the applications’ external connection — not from any issue or vulnerability within the Salesforce platform,” the company said in a Thursday update.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The customer success software vendor acknowledged that access to Gainsight via Salesforce remains unavailable. As a precautionary measure, Gainsight also disclosed that its Zendesk connector access has been revoked, and its app has been temporarily pulled from the HubSpot Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-threat-intelligence-ties-attack-to-shinyhunters"&gt;Google threat intelligence ties attack to ShinyHunters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disclosure marks the latest chapter in an escalating pattern of attacks targeting OAuth tokens of trusted third-party SaaS integrations with Salesforce. According to Austin Larsen, principal threat analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, the campaign is tied to threat actors associated with ShinyHunters. This notorious extortion group has repeatedly targeted the Salesforce ecosystem over the recent months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our team at Google Threat Intelligence Group has observed threat actors, tied to ShinyHunters, compromising third-party OAuth tokens to potentially gain unauthorized access to Salesforce customer instances,” Larsen said in a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/austinlarsen_we-are-monitoring-an-emerging-campaign-targeting-activity-7266130819987574784-9hKE" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt;. “Salesforce and Mandiant are actively notifying potentially affected organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Larsen noted the incident mirrors the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042191/shinyhunters-strike-again-workday-breach-tied-to-salesforce-targeted-social-engineering-wave.html"&gt;recent campaign targeting Salesloft Drift&lt;/a&gt;, where adversaries exploited OAuth tokens of legitimate SaaS integrations to bypass traditional security controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to DataBreaches.net, ShinyHunters has &lt;a href="https://databreaches.net/2025/11/20/threat-actors-have-reportedly-launched-yet-another-campaign-involving-an-application-connected-to-salesforce/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; involvement in the Gainsight campaign and claims the combined Salesloft and Gainsight campaigns affected almost 1,000 organizations, with victims including Verizon, GitLab, F5, and SonicWall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, neither Salesforce nor Gainsight attributed this incident to ShinyHunters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="august-breach-enabled-a-cascading-attack"&gt;August breach enabled a cascading attack&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical connection between the current incident and the August breach became clearer through analysis from Nudge Security, a SaaS security platform. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nudgesecurity.com/post/suspected-compromise-of-gainsight-connected-salesforce-instances-via-oauth-tokens" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nudge Security’s security alert&lt;/a&gt;, ShinyHunters obtained Gainsight OAuth tokens through secrets stolen from Salesloft/Drift support case data. Using those compromised tokens, the attackers allegedly issued refresh tokens for up to 285 Salesforce instances linked to Gainsight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Salesloft Drift breach in August exposed approximately 760 companies to data theft, with attackers stealing OAuth tokens and using them to access Salesforce instances across hundreds of organizations. Victims included major enterprises such as Google, Cloudflare, Qantas, Cisco, and TransUnion. Gainsight itself was among the victims of that earlier campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chain-risks-in-saas-integrations"&gt;Supply chain risks in SaaS integrations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gainsight, a customer success platform widely deployed among enterprise Salesforce customers, provides tools that integrate directly with Salesforce to sync customer data and automate engagement workflows. These integrations typically require OAuth access to account information, contact records, opportunity data, and usage metrics for health scoring and retention analytics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident underscores the growing risk posed by the supply chain of SaaS integrations, where a single compromised vendor can serve as a gateway into dozens of downstream environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs and security teams, Larsen emphasized the need for immediate action beyond just the Gainsight incident. “All organizations should view this as a signal to audit their SaaS environments,” he said, recommending that security teams regularly review all third-party applications connected to Salesforce instances, investigate and revoke tokens for unused or suspicious applications, and assume compromise if anomalous activity is detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacks prove effective because OAuth tokens operate beneath traditional authentication layers, according to Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “OAuth token compromise is one of the most dangerous attack vectors in the modern SaaS ecosystem because it abuses trust rather than breaking through defences,” Gogia said. “Once an attacker acquires a token, they gain the ability to impersonate a legitimate app or user at the API layer, where most enterprises have the least monitoring coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most OAuth tokens are long-lived, often without expiration, and carry broader permissions than administrators realize, Gogia noted. “Because these tokens function as infrastructure rather than monitored user accounts, compromises enable silent, high-value data exfiltration over extended periods. The attacks don’t behave like typical intrusions but rather operate with inherited legitimacy, making them particularly difficult to detect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This incident follows a series of Salesforce-related security events throughout 2025, including an &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4063044/vulnerability-in-salesforce-ai-could-be-tricked-into-leaking-crm-data.html"&gt;AI agent vulnerability in September&lt;/a&gt; that could be exploited through prompt injection attacks, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4006341/salesforce-industry-cloud-riddled-with-configuration-risks.html"&gt;configuration risks discovered in Salesforce Industry Cloud&lt;/a&gt; that could expose encrypted customer information.

      <title>How to turn threat intel into real security wins</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093927/how-to-turn-threat-intel-into-real-security-wins.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders aren’t short of data, they’re short of decisions. Here’s how to turn threat feeds into an operating model that measurably reduces loss, accelerates response and earns board confidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-problem-isnt-data-its-conversion"&gt;The problem isn’t data, it’s conversion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern security operations centres ingest torrents of artefacts: Indicators of compromise, suspicious domains, sandbox reports, takedown notices and headlines about the latest campaign. Much of it is relevant in theory; too little of it turns into consistent action. Alert queues swell, analysts burn out and executives receive dashboards that never quite answer the only question that matters: What changed in our risk profile? The recent &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2025-dbir-executive-summary.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report&lt;/a&gt; analyzed &lt;strong&gt;22,052 incidents &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; 12,195 breaches&lt;/strong&gt;, noting &lt;strong&gt;third-party involvement doubled to 30%&lt;/strong&gt;, a stark reminder that decisions (not dashboards) move risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Operationalising CTI is the fix. Not “more feeds”, but a disciplined way to turn intelligence into repeatable decisions across detection engineering, incident response and investment governance. When done well, CTI becomes a business function, not a side project: a capability that helps you avoid loss, protect revenue and demonstrate resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-ciso-mandate-risk-efficiency-investment-response"&gt;The CISO mandate: Risk, efficiency, investment, response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="reduce-operational-risk-and-financial-loss"&gt;Reduce operational risk and financial loss&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intelligence-led detection and response aim to prevent or minimise data loss and business disruption. The downstream effects, smaller blast radii, fewer regulatory headaches and lower recovery bills, are what boards recognise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="maximise-staff-efficiency"&gt;Maximise staff efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manual validation and correlation drive alert fatigue. Automating the plumbing, collection, normalization, enrichment and scoring frees analysts to do high-value work: scoping incidents, testing hypotheses and advising the business. The outcome is fewer swivel-chair tasks and more time on the activities that move risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="make-better-investment-calls"&gt;Make better investment calls&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strategic intelligence clarifies which adversaries, techniques and sectors matter to you. That clarity shapes roadmaps and spend, uplifting the controls most likely to reduce your top loss scenarios. CTI becomes a lens for budget prioritization, not a cost centre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strengthen-incident-response"&gt;Strengthen incident response&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During an investigation, context is everything. CTI shortens decision time by linking artefacts to known tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and likely objectives, informing containment and eradication with confidence. It also feeds the learning loop after an incident, improving detections and playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-teams-drown-overload-chaos-and-waste"&gt;Why teams drown: Overload, chaos and waste&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="information-overload"&gt;Information overload&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uncurated feeds generate volume, not value. Without scoring, de-duplication and relevance filtering, your SIEM and SOAR become conduits for noise. The result is longer queues and slower response, not better coverage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="unstructured-chaos"&gt;Unstructured chaos&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Intel arrives as PDFs, emails, blog posts and social snippets. Without a way to structure, categorise, search and correlate across sources and internal telemetry, analysis becomes ad hoc and outcomes vary by individual analyst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="inefficient-resource-use"&gt;Inefficient resource use&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hours disappear into manual lookups and copy-paste tasks. That time is lost to threat hunting, detection tuning and rehearsing scenarios that reduce loss. The opportunity cost is real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-feeds-to-decisions-an-operating-model-that-works"&gt;From feeds to decisions: An operating model that works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-start-with-priority-intelligence-requirements-pirs"&gt;1) Start with priority intelligence requirements (PIRs)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Translate business risk into focused questions that guide everything else. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Which ransomware affiliates target our sector and identity stack?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“What initial access vectors are trending against our cloud collaboration tools?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Which suppliers expose us to the most likely attack paths this quarter?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PIRs are the north star for collection, automation, reporting and stakeholder alignment. If a feed or task doesn’t serve a PIR, stop doing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-engineer-the-plumbing-once-apply-it-everywhere"&gt;2) Engineer the plumbing once; apply it everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collection &amp;amp; normalization:&lt;/strong&gt; Ingest sources via APIs and standardise where practical (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/2021/06/23/stix-v2-1-and-taxii-v2-1-oasis-standards-are-published/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;STIX/TAXII&lt;/a&gt;). Prioritise curated sources (sector ISACs/ISAOs, trusted vendors, national advisories) over sheer volume.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated enrichment:&lt;/strong&gt; WHOIS, passive DNS, malware family classification, internal sightings, asset context and exposure data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoring &amp;amp; prioritization:&lt;/strong&gt; Weight by PIR relevance, actor confidence, recency and internal visibility (e.g., “seen in our estate”).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOAR orchestration:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-approved playbooks push high-confidence items to blocklists, EDR, mail gateways and detection backlogs with sensible human checkpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal: Analysts spend their time on judgment and synthesis, not plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-build-detections-around-behaviours-not-just-iocs"&gt;3) Build detections around behaviours, not just IOCs&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indicators are perishable. Behaviours persist. Map adversary tradecraft to &lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/a&gt; and write analytic stories that chain techniques (for example, phishing → token theft → conditional access bypass → exfiltration). Indicators support the story; they are not the story. This shift reduces alert noise and increases durability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-integrate-cti-with-ir-and-threat-hunting"&gt;4) Integrate CTI with IR and threat hunting&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before incidents:&lt;/strong&gt; Hunters use PIRs to form hypotheses; detection engineers validate coverage against priority techniques and known gaps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During incidents:&lt;/strong&gt; The intel desk provides live context: likely objectives, lateral movement patterns, command-and-control families and exfil destinations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After incidents:&lt;/strong&gt; Lessons learned feed back into PIRs, detection content and control tuning. Intelligence isn’t a weekly PDF; it’s woven into the incident timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-tie-it-to-familiar-frameworks-and-obligations"&gt;5) Tie it to familiar frameworks and obligations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use CTI to focus uplift efforts for recognized frameworks and controls (for example, aligning ATT&amp;amp;CK techniques to your control catalogue; steering patching towards actively exploited vulnerabilities; mapping improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST CSF 2.0&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/business-government/asds-cyber-security-frameworks/essential-eight" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ACSC Essential Eight&lt;/a&gt;). CTI becomes evidence for audits, regulatory queries or board reviews and a rationale for retiring low-value tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-good-looks-like-signals-of-maturity"&gt;What ‘good’ looks like: Signals of maturity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source rationalization:&lt;/strong&gt; Every source maps to at least one PIR; unused feeds are retired.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frictionless ingestion:&lt;/strong&gt; IOC intake is automatically enriched, scored and de-duplicated before any human sees it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviour-first detections:&lt;/strong&gt; Coverage is ATT&amp;amp;CK-mapped, versioned and reviewed on a cadence with drift alarms for stale content.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded in IR:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel summaries appear in incident timelines and post-incident reports by default.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive clarity:&lt;/strong&gt; Reporting is one slide: decisions made, risk reduced, efficiency gained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are practical markers a CISO can ask for and a SOC can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-questions-cti-must-answer"&gt;The questions CTI must answer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; is targeting us (actors, affiliates, ecosystems)?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; methods are they using (TTPs, tooling, infrastructure)?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt; are we exposed (control gaps, external attack surface, supplier risk)?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; is activity likely (campaign tempo, seasonal patterns, triggers)?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; are we attractive (industry, data, geo-political context, monetization path)?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How&lt;/strong&gt; do we prevent or disrupt this (detections, controls, playbooks, takedowns)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your program can’t reliably answer these six, you have feeds, not intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pitfalls-to-avoid-and-how-to-sidestep-them"&gt;Pitfalls to avoid (and how to sidestep them)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ioc-only-thinking"&gt;IOC-only thinking&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem:&lt;/em&gt; Chasing disposable indicators floods tooling and burns people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Prioritise behavior-based analytics; let indicators be supporting evidence fed by automated pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="feed-sprawl"&gt;Feed sprawl&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem:&lt;/em&gt; “Because we can” is not a strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Tie every source to a PIR and a decision path. If it doesn’t contribute, switch it off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="manual-everything"&gt;Manual everything&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem:&lt;/em&gt; Copy-paste culture never scales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; Automate collection, normalization, enrichment and scoring. Reserve human time for investigation and synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="reporting-that-doesnt-drive-a-decision"&gt;Reporting that doesn’t drive a decision&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem:&lt;/em&gt; Dashboards tell you the weather; executives need the forecast and the flight plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix:&lt;/strong&gt; End every intel output with a recommendation: block, monitor, hunt, tune, invest or rehearse and track whether the decision happened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="metrics-that-matter-to-the-board"&gt;Metrics that matter to the board&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="risk-outcomes-loss-avoidance"&gt;Risk outcomes (loss avoidance)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tie CTI to reduced exposure in top scenarios (for example, ransomware or business email compromise). Show how intelligence prompted tangible changes, conditional access uplift, macro controls tightened, vulnerable components patched and estimate the reduction in probable loss. This is the CFO-friendly narrative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="operational-efficiency-capacity-reclaimed"&gt;Operational efficiency (capacity reclaimed)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measure what changed in the SOC when CTI engaged: percentage of alerts auto-enriched or auto-closed, mean time to detect/respond (MTTD/MTTR) deltas and analyst hours redirected from triage to hunting and engineering. Pair numbers with one concrete case study per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="detection-efficacy-coverage-and-freshness"&gt;Detection efficacy (coverage and freshness)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Track the proportion of detections mapped to ATT&amp;amp;CK, coverage of priority techniques for your sector and drift alarms for stale content. Demonstrate that your detection catalog evolves with adversary behavior, not yesterday’s indicators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="investment-quality-spend-that-follows-risk"&gt;Investment quality (spend that follows risk)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Show budget alignment to PIRs, retirement of low-value tools or feeds and targeted control uplift tied to intelligence findings. This proves CTI informs governance, not just operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="high-impact-use-cases-you-can-start-now"&gt;High-impact use cases you can start now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomware-affiliate-watchlist"&gt;Ransomware affiliate watchlist&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maintain current TTPs for affiliates most active in your sector. Convert them to block rules, analytic stories and tabletop scenarios. Pair with conditional access reviews and data exfiltration detections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="brand-and-executive-impersonation"&gt;Brand and executive impersonation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monitor look-alike domains, app store abuse and executive impersonation patterns. Automate takedown requests; feed patterns into mail and web gateways; brief the communications team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="supplier-and-saas-exposure"&gt;Supplier and SaaS exposure&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use CTI to score supplier risk, known compromises, actively exploited components, leaked credentials and exploit development appetite. Prioritize compensating controls and procurement clauses that demand transparency and response commitments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="phishing-to-ransomware-chain"&gt;Phishing-to-ransomware chain&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Correlate lure themes, payload families and command-and-control infrastructure. Pre-position email filters, endpoint detections and a targeted awareness burst that reflects current lures, then measure click-through and reporting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each use case is deliberately narrow, measurable and PIR-aligned, the opposite of “boil the ocean.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-bottom-line"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CTI delivers value only when it changes what you detect, how you respond, what you buy and what you rehearse. The shift from raw feeds to an operational capability isn’t about tools or volume; it’s about disciplined focus (PIRs), behavior-first detections, automation that removes toil and reporting that triggers decisions. Get those right and you move from chasing yesterday’s indicators to interrupting tomorrow’s attacks, while giving executives the one thing they want most: proof that resilience is improving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Root causes of security breaches remain elusive — jeopardizing resilience</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093403/root-causes-of-security-breaches-remain-elusive-jeopardizing-resilience.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-incident analysis remains a critical concern at most security organizations today. According to Foundry’s Security Priorities study, 57% of security leaders report their organization struggled to find the root cause of security incidents experienced in the past year, leaving them at heightened risk of getting breached again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts tell CSO the finding underscores that the immediate pressure to firefight often leaves post-incident learning under-resourced. Organizations need to treat &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009438/how-to-conduct-an-effective-post-incident-review.html"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt; as a continuous learning cycle, not a one-time clean-up exercise if they are to reduce the likelihood of repeat breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations are stuck in a reactive cycle, focusing solely on containing the immediate breach, which comes at the expense of a crucial forensic investigation, leaving the ‘patient door’ wide open for the next attacker to walk right back in,” &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/authors/dray-agha"&gt;Dray Agha&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of security operations at managed security response firm Huntress, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a thorough postmortem to pinpoint the root cause, companies are essentially defending themselves blindfolded, destined to repeat the same mistakes,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-through-root-cause-analysis"&gt;Resilience through root cause analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agree that too many enterprises treat incident response as an operational exercise rather than an analytical one. As a result, containment and recovery actions might be well-rehearsed while deeper forensic investigation and post-incident learning lag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a disciplined approach to evidence preservation and &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/350219/what-is-root-cause-analysis-a-proactive-approach-to-change-management.html"&gt;root cause analysis&lt;/a&gt;, valuable insights are lost,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-moore-724212/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Tom Moore&lt;/a&gt;, director of digital forensics and incident response at managed security services vendor BlueVoyant. “Robust incident response isn’t just about getting systems back online — it’s about using lessons learned to inform detection, prevention, and risk mitigation strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moore adds: “That continuous feedback loop ultimately drives long-term resilience and is particularly valuable when the cyber threat landscape is evolving and adapting so quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariehargraves/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Marie Hargraves&lt;/a&gt;, principal crisis management consultant at cloud security vendor Semperis, agrees that “most organizations focus on fighting fires instead of learning from the flames.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every crisis has three phases: detection, response (the acute phase), and review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the third phase, the post-crisis review, where resilience is built,” Hargraves says. “Organizations that capture real-time data, analyze it rigorously, and act on lessons identified recover faster and emerge stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Incident response isn’t just about surviving; it’s about adapting and building resilience,” Hargraves adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tracing-an-attack-path"&gt;Tracing an attack path&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preparation is key, so businesses need to have dedicated tools and skills for digital forensics in place before an incident occurs through technologies such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/524286/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html"&gt;security incident and event management (SIEM)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/566677/12-top-siem-tools-rated-and-compared.html"&gt;SIEM devices&lt;/a&gt; are important because, for example, many gateway and VPN devices have a local storage that overwrites itself within hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If a cybercriminal breaks in through the VPN and dwells for a day or so before they pivot to business-critical servers, then the VPN telemetry has evaporated into the abyss,” Huntress’ Agha explains. “The centralization and retention of VPN logs, like through a SIEM, allows for reactive detections but also stores valuable data and allows for root cause analysis to figure out how the initial breach [occurred].”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistics from Huntress show that near 70% of sophisticated cybercriminals break in through the VPN. “Where SIEM has been enabled, we are able to catch them much earlier in their attack path, but also deploy retrospective analysis to identify the exact root cause that led to the breach,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various services such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573533/top-12-managed-detection-and-response-solutions.html"&gt;managed detection and response (MDR)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574295/11-top-xdr-tools-and-how-to-evaluate-them.html"&gt;extended detection and response (XDR)&lt;/a&gt; can also include forensic capturing software — technology that enables providers to work hand in hand with forensic cyber investigators to identify the source of the breach and work to remediate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without tools such as this, trying to work back retrospectively to identify the ‘how’ becomes increasingly difficult,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-derbyshire-48291b25/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Rob Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at cybersecurity firm Securus Communication. “There are companies that offer incident response services when breaches occur, but the key to sorting it quickly, and preventing it from happening again, is ensuring you already have the tooling and processes to make any response significantly slicker.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eclecticiq.com/eclecticiq-intelligence-research-team-arda-b%C3%BCy%C3%BCkkaya"&gt;Arda Büyükkaya&lt;/a&gt;, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at EclecticIQ, points out that without thorough root-cause analysis the “actual cause of the attack remains unknown and potentially still active.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Best practices should include digital forensics expertise, root cause analysis processes, and threat intelligence integration to connect incidents to broader attacker tactics and campaigns,” Büyükkaya advises. “This approach allows organizations to build resilience from every incident.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="robust-planning"&gt;Robust planning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An incident response team, typically led by the CISO, should be designated to take charge during an incident. The plan should also specify roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder, from IT staff to legal advisors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts quizzed by CSO say an incident response playbook boils down to a few key steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a tested incident response plan, clear roles, and escalation paths.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection and analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Centralize monitoring, leverage threat intelligence, and ensure forensic capability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containment and recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Act fast but preserve evidence; validate systems before restoration.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postmortem:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct structured reviews, document findings, and feed them into security architecture and training.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate threat modeling, automate containment, and invest in skills development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations opt to use established frameworks and ISO standards as templates for their incident response plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These frameworks offer a structured approach, providing sections and subsections that cover all essential areas, from governance to technical responses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-ford-a4026421/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Richard Ford&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Integrity360. “By using a recognized framework, you not only ensure completeness but also facilitate easier communication with external parties who may be familiar with the framework.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-organizational-resilience"&gt;Building organizational resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective incident response should be geared toward building a structured, repeatable, and intelligence-driven process that strengthens resilience over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incident response plans should be regularly tested, refined, and updated — for example, through simulations or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a wider business continuity and organizational resilience strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharat-mistry-952414/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Bharat Mistry&lt;/a&gt;, field CTO at cybersecurity vendor Trend Micro, says many organizations suffer from a maturity gap in their incident response — which should extend beyond simply containment and recovery to encompass forensic analysis and postmortems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When organizations bypass root cause analysis, they are only treating symptoms,” Mistry warns. “This challenge stems from a combination of issues: fragmented visibility due to siloed tools that prevent accurate attack reconstruction, a skills gap that leaves teams short on forensics and threat hunting expertise, and process weaknesses where postmortems are often informal or simply skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="breaking-the-cycle-of-breach-patch-repeat"&gt;Breaking the cycle of ‘breach, patch, repeat’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, evidence is inadvertently destroyed, such as when servers are wiped, logs are lost, and forensic trails disappear, because the emphasis is on restoring operations quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is compounded by pressure from the business, time constraints, as well as limited resources, which push teams to move on to the next urgent task rather than learning from the incident,” Mistry adds. “As a result, retrospective scans, root cause analysis, and updates to procedures are frequently skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial attack vector and lateral movement often remain unknown, leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed and creating a cycle of “breach, patch, repeat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To break this cycle, organizations must embed forensic readiness into their response strategy: preserve evidence, conduct structured postmortems, and ensure lessons learned are fed back into security architecture and training,” Mistry concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
