      <title>Who Operates the Badbox 2.0 Botnet?</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/01/who-operates-the-badbox-2-0-botnet/</link>
      <description>The cybercriminals in control of Kimwolf -- a disruptive botnet that has infected more than 2 million devices -- recently shared a screenshot indicating they'd compromised the control panel for Badbox 2.0, a vast China-based botnet powered by malicious software that comes pre-installed on many Android TV streaming boxes. Both the FBI and Google say they are hunting for the people behind Badbox 2.0, and thanks to bragging by the Kimwolf botmasters we may now have a much clearer idea about that.</description>

Three recent actions coordinated by Europol, one targeting a Dutch-led network embedded in Colombian supply chains, another dismantling a Brazilian maritime trafficking operation and a third disrupting a Greek at-sea transfer criminal operation, highlight the ongoing efforts to disrupt the routes and structures used by organised crime.</description>

      <title>Fortinet confirms new zero-day attacks against customer devices</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4121682/fortinet-confirms-new-zero-day-attacks-against-customer-devices.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortinet has confirmed that a new attack campaign observed recently against customer devices is exploiting an unpatched issue to bypass authentication. The new attacks are different from a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4107440/fortigate-firewall-credentials-being-stolen-after-vulnerabilities-discovered.html"&gt;previous campaign seen in December&lt;/a&gt; that targeted two vulnerabilities related to FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) authentication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Recently, a small number of customers reported unexpected login activity occurring on their devices, which appeared very similar to the previous issue,” the Fortinet product security team said in &lt;a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/psirt-blogs/analysis-of-sso-abuse-on-fortios"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “However, in the last 24 hours, we have identified a number of cases where the exploit was to a device that had been fully upgraded to the latest release at the time of the attack, which suggested a new attack path.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortinet is currently working on fixing the new issue, which impacts not only FortiCloud SSO, but all SAML SSO implementations. It’s worth noting that FortiCloud SSO is not enabled by default on devices but can become enabled when an administrator registers the device with FortiCare product support from the device’s management interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reports-of-similar-attacks"&gt;Reports of similar attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortinet &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4104499/fortinet-admins-urged-to-update-software-to-close-forticloud-sso-holes.html"&gt;patched two improper cryptographic signature verification issues&lt;/a&gt;, CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, in December. These flaws could be exploited to bypass authentication on devices with FortiCloud SSO enabled by sending specially crafted SAML messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon after the patches were released, attackers reverse engineered them and launched a campaign to extract configuration files from vulnerable devices. Those files included hashed credentials for other user accounts and details that would allow network mapping.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, researchers from security firm Arctic Wolf &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/arctic-wolf-observes-malicious-configuration-changes-fortinet-fortigate-devices-via-sso-accounts/"&gt;reported seeing a new attack campaign&lt;/a&gt; that started around Jan. 15 in which attackers similarly extracted firewall configurations but also used their access to create new generic accounts and give VPN access to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company noted at the time that it was unsure whether this activity was related to the two December vulnerabilities or to a new zero-day vulnerability. Fortinet has now confirmed the latter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The December flaws affected FortiOS, FortiWeb, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitch Manager, so it’s reasonable to assume the new issue impacts the same devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Fortinet blog post references the same indicators of compromise listed in the Arctic Wolf report, namely malicious accounts created with the email addresses &lt;code&gt;cloud-init@mail.io&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cloud-noc@mail.io&lt;/code&gt;. Other admin accounts are created with the names: &lt;code&gt;audit&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;itadmin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;secadmin&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;support&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation"&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If these or other IOCs such as IP addresses are identified in configurations or the device logs, the system and its configuration should be considered compromised. Fortinet recommends updating the device to the latest available software release, restoring a configuration from a clean backup, and rotating all credentials, including any LDAP/AD accounts that may be connected to the FortiGate devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The setting “Allow administrative login using FortiCloud SSO” should be set to off, but if any third-party SSO systems are enabled they can still be abused. Administrative access should not be enabled from the Internet for network-edge devices, so Fortinet PSIRT shared a policy configuration that restricts access to the administrative interface only to specific subnets of IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>CISO’s predictions for 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116527/cisos-predictions-for-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4102893/cybersecurity-leaders-top-seven-takeaways-from-2025.html"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; was defined by AI hype, new attack models, and intensifying global tensions. As 2026 begins, security teams are asking what the next phase will look like. Will AI continue to accelerate risk, or will controls and governance finally catch up?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSO spoke to 10 security leaders about their predictions and aspirations for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="governance-scrambles-to-keep-pace-with-ai"&gt;Governance scrambles to keep pace with AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes deeply embedded in day-to-day business operations, security leaders are being pushed to scale governance models far faster than before. For &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-hensley/"&gt;Barry Hensley&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at Brown &amp;amp; Brown Insurance, this translates to strengthening data guardrails by expanding data loss protection and monitoring, tightening identity controls, and introducing governance across both human and machine identities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That push towards structure and oversight is also reshaping how organizations define security at scale. As United Airlines CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deneendefiore/"&gt;Deneen DeFiore&lt;/a&gt; puts it, 2026 security will be less about perimeter defense and more about operational resilience at scale. “Threat actors will increasingly use generative AI to automate reconnaissance, social engineering, and exploit chaining, while defenders will rely on AI to prioritize risk, accelerate detection, and reduce response times,” she says. “The differentiator won’t be whether organizations use AI, but how well they govern, tune, and trust it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Repurpose It CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/noeltoal/"&gt;Noel Toal&lt;/a&gt; predicts that AI risk frameworks will increasingly reach board level. He believes these frameworks will give directors the structure and confidence to ask harder questions about AI exposure, triggering audits and help unlock long-needed security funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeFiore also expects governance conversations to shift beyond traditional risk management and towards continuous cyber resilience. “Boards and regulators are already asking not just, ‘Can you prevent an attack?’ but “Can you continue operating when one happens?’” She believes that changes will drive deeper investment in identity security, segmentation, recovery testing, and third-party resilience rather than point solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-agents-to-reshape-the-threat-landscape"&gt;AI agents to reshape the threat landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But those same AI technologies are also changing the threat landscape. Toal points to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage"&gt;Anthropic report&lt;/a&gt; that documented the first large-scale AI-enabled cyberattack as an early warning sign. “I guarantee attackers will be more focused on using AI agents for what they want than a lot of businesses, because businesses in general are still very slow to adopt AI agents.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, Toal says organizations will need to secure their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt;AI agents with the same rigor applied to human users. “We’ll have to treat internal AI agents as identities, and monitor what they access, when they run, and whether their behavior makes sense,” he says. Without that shift, he cautions, organizations risk unleashing tools inside their networks that attackers could readily turn against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Challenger CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-payten-gaicd-20bbb5/"&gt;Katie Payten&lt;/a&gt; agrees the rise of agentic AI fundamentally expands the identity attack surface. “The perimeter isn’t just the external perimeter anymore; identity is the perimeter.” She adds that as organizations deploy AI agents internally, governance must extend beyond human users. “Knowing what your agent has access to, how it’s making decisions, and taking responsibility for that will be essential.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI becomes more deeply integrated, the sensitive data these systems rely on will become “an increasingly attractive target”, with more &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4075912/ai-enabled-ransomware-attacks-cisos-top-security-concern-with-good-reason.html"&gt;AI-enabled attack methods&lt;/a&gt; “poised to occupy a growing share of the threat landscape,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelagarvin/"&gt;Michael Garvin&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at Jaggaer. As a result, he believes data security posture management will also become more important. “Because AI depends on large volumes of high-quality, sensitive data, organizations will need better visibility into how that data is accessed, classified, and protected.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergana-winzer-0939937/"&gt;Gergana Winzer&lt;/a&gt;, partner and cyber security mid-market lead at KPMG, the real threat with AI is not just scale, but autonomy. She warns that AI-driven attacks will increasingly make their own target and execution decisions, reducing the need for human involvement. “Everything can be automated today, not only on the side of companies, but also on the side of the criminals,” she says, raising questions about how AI-enabled threats could extend beyond the digital realm into the physical world through AI-powered drones, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security teams will consolidate visibility and automate response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about what else 2026 could mean for the global security industry, Ramsay Healthcare CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manal-alsharif/"&gt;Manal Al-Sharif&lt;/a&gt; believes AI will play a crucial role in helping consolidate telemetry into a single view. “When you bring everything in, it’s easy to triage and prioritize,” she says. “Having that single point of view means you’re correlating everything at the same time, so you know where you’re exposed most … [and] before those threats become incidents.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Garvin expects security strategies to evolve inside SOCs as AI becomes more embedded. “The biggest shift will be the deeper integration of AI into defensive security operations. Organizations will increasingly invest in securing AI models and data pipelines, and they will evolve penetration testing and adversarial testing approaches to evaluate AI systems with the same rigor applied to traditional applications.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadiavp/"&gt;Nadia Veeran-Patel&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at LRMG, &lt;strong&gt;has already seen this reshape incident workflows firsthand.&lt;/strong&gt; “Our analysts were looking at incidents individually as they came through as alerts, but when AI brought them together as a collection, you suddenly realize those alerts are actually a series of events that led to something bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeFiore also expects a fundamental shift in how security teams operate day to day. In 2026, she wants teams spending less time reacting to alerts and more time on anticipation and enablement, by using automation, better data, and tighter integration with IT and business partners to reduce friction and accelerate decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She adds what’s equally important is continued investment in people and culture. “Technology evolves quickly, but resilient organizations are built by teams that are well-trained, empowered, and aligned to a shared mission,” she says. “Creating clarity around risk ownership and decision-making is just as critical as any tool we deploy. Ultimately, success looks like a security program that enables innovation, withstands disruption, and earns trust at every level of the organization, from the boardroom to the front line.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toal expects AI-driven orchestration to become a defining feature of modern SOCs in 2026, as AI increasingly isolates compromised endpoints, blocks malicious IPs, rolls back ransomware in real time, and maps an attacker’s path. “The mean time to response would be vastly reduced. Instead of taking hours to respond to an incident, you could start to respond hopefully within seconds … [and] engage properly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="smes-will-become-prime-targets-amid-rising-automation"&gt;SMEs will become prime targets amid rising automation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Winzer adds 2026 will mark a decisive shift, with SMEs becoming primary targets for ransomware. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tea/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf"&gt;2025 Verizon data breach report&lt;/a&gt;, ransomware made up 44% of all breaches globally, and SMEs represented a disproportionate percentage of victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Why? Because they’re easy now … the rationale is they have limited security maturity and they cannot absorb outages, so they end up paying [the ransomware], even though the government is saying, ‘Don’t pay’. But it’s really difficult for them to negotiate because they don’t have the budget to put proper recovery plans in place.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Winzer warns that AI-driven reconnaissance is accelerating this trend. “AI today is very capable. You can press a button and very quickly do a huge amount of damage within a few seconds.” Combined with gaps in mid-market MSSP coverage, which are “not necessarily as complete”, she says that makes it very easy for the attackers to go after SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veeran-Patel has seen a similar escalation in criminal tactics. “We have seen attackers routinely employing what we call triple extortion, where they combine not only data encryption, data leaking/extortion, and also leveraging third parties, like customers, regulators, and vendors, to put pressure on their victims to pay the ransoms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, Winzer is cautiously optimistic that vendors will begin delivering more tailored solutions to the mid-market. “They did not do before. Now they’re realizing this is a huge target, and it’s also an opportunity to provide services.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chains-remain-vulnerable-as-nation-state-activity-intensifies"&gt;Supply chains remain vulnerable as nation-state activity intensifies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Winzer sees critical infrastructure as a primary cyber battlefield. Operational environments are “far more reachable,” she says, due to IT/OT convergence, cloud-connected control systems, and remote-access pathways that remain exposed even when partial segmentation exists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Payten warns that data risk is increasingly hidden within complex supply chains, as organizations rely on expanding ecosystems of third-party and SaaS providers. That reliance, she says, quietly compounds exposure. “We’re using so many third parties, and those third parties use their own third parties; they become fourth parties,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge is not just assessing vendors at the point of engagement but maintaining visibility over where sensitive data ultimately resides. “You can’t outsource your accountability,” Payten says. “You still own the data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Healthcare and local councils remain high-risk targets as well, driven by low cyber budgets, sensitive population data and the high cost of downtime, Winzer adds. “Before [attackers] were going after the cash only. But now they’re looking at reputational damage, because that causes organizations to pay faster.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veeran-Patel expects nation-state pressure to intensify too, warning that geopolitical conflict is increasingly being played out in cyberspace. “Cyber warfare is a real thing,” she says. “Wars are no longer going to be fought on the front lines with soldiers on the ground. They are likely going to be fought with buttons.” Her concern is that many governments are still not treating the risk with the level of urgency it requires, despite signs of critical infrastructure in developing nations already being taken offline by hostile actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vendors-must-deliver-secure-by-design-products"&gt;Vendors must deliver secure-by-design products&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Al-Sharif believes 2026 will be the year when the industry confronts a long-ignored truth that non-malicious insiders are not the main problem. “My issue is with the technology makers,” she says. “They still give me a car with no brake, no lock, no seatbelts. They sell it to me and find a way for me to sign away my rights … my issue is that technology makers need to be held accountable for creating flawed technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She predicts insecure defaults will become untenable as incidents continue to trace back to weak authentication and outdated access controls. She says the problem is especially visible in healthcare, where connected devices still arrive with default passwords and cannot be patched without voiding warranties. “I want the government to make sure there’s a way to measure how secure those devices are before I connect a life support machine to them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Payten echoes concerns about insecure defaults and poorly secured connected devices. From routers to smart appliances, she highlights default credentials and weak configurations remain widespread. “There are still people with default passwords on their routers … and now there are so many connected devices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="now-is-the-time-to-prepare-for-post-quantum-cryptography"&gt;Now is the time to prepare for post-quantum cryptography&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoe-hearn-68478624/"&gt;Zoe Hearn&lt;/a&gt;, head of cybersecurity strategy and governance at Insignia Financial, says rising expectations from customers, regulators, and governments are pushing organizations to take a more proactive role in preparing for the post-quantum era. She points out how simply complying with emerging standards will not be enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With quantum-vulnerable encryption set to be phased out by 2030, now is the time to invest in future-ready security infrastructure,” she says. For Hearn, the shift demands leadership, not just technical uplift, as quantum risk increasingly becomes a board-level conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothyyoungblood/"&gt;Timothy Youngblood&lt;/a&gt;, CISO in residence at Astrix Security and former CISO at McDonald’s and T-Mobile, shares the same concern. He expects progressive enterprises to begin mapping their quantum security in preparation of the mainstream arrival of the technology. “The more progressive enterprises are going to start to assess their quantum security gaps, who are the partners that they need to address that,” he says. “It has the potential to be another Y2K. It’s a slow-moving Y2K. Of course, people are going to be caught off guard whenever quantum becomes mainstream, and that’s coming. It’s time to assess what the strategies are.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toal believes boards will soon pay closer attention to quantum risk as well. He notes that attackers are already harvesting encrypted data today in anticipation of future decryption. “It might still be slightly behind AI recognition, but I think boards are going to realize they have a longer-term problem,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auditors, he predicts, will begin raising quantum preparedness in security reviews, forcing it onto roadmaps. “If they’re not addressing the fact that a minor breach today could become a major problem in the near future, that’s a gap boards will need to reckon with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Bureau of Investigation approached Microsoft with a search warrant in early 2025, seeking keys to unlock encrypted data stored on three laptops in a case of alleged fraud involving the COVID unemployment assistance program in Guam. As the keys were stored on a Microsoft server, Microsoft adhered to the legal order and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2026/01/22/microsoft-gave-fbi-keys-to-unlock-bitlocker-encrypted-data/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;handed over the encryption keys&lt;/a&gt;, Forbes reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been instances in the past where the big tech companies were approached by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3812874/how-law-enforcement-agents-gain-access-to-encrypted-devices.html"&gt;law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; for access to devices but have &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/554969/apple-vs-the-fbi-the-legal-arguments-in-a-nutshell.html"&gt;resisted&lt;/a&gt; handing encryption keys to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BitLocker is a widely used tool for securing data at rest, whether by individuals or enterprises managing hundreds or thousands of Windows devices. By default, many Windows installations back up BitLocker recovery keys to Microsoft’s cloud services, where Microsoft can retrieve them if legally compelled with a valid order.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="custody-issue-not-bitlocker"&gt;Custody issue, not BitLocker&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BitLocker is designed to provide encryption for entire volumes, addressing the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned devices. As BitLocker is bunded with Windows 10 and Windows 11, it has effectively become the default full-disk encryption layer across Windows endpoints, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“BitLocker itself does not fail here. The software does what it is built to do, encrypts the disk, integrates into Windows, allows for easy recovery,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the encryption of BitLocker is robust, enterprises need to be mindful of who has custody of the keys, as this case illustrates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The encryption engine in BitLocker, using AES-128 or AES-256 in XTS mode, is built to resist modern cryptanalysis. Even the US Department of Homeland Security has admitted they lack the forensic tooling to break it directly. However, most enterprise fleets running Windows use tools like Intune and Autopilot to roll out and manage devices. In that flow, unless explicitly disabled, recovery keys are automatically backed up to Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4060101/entra-id-vulnerability-exposes-gaps-in-cloud-identity-trust-models-experts-warn.html"&gt;Entra ID.&lt;/a&gt; These keys are then viewable via the admin centre or retrievable through scripts,” Gogia said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-most-enterprises-go-wrong"&gt;Where most enterprises go wrong&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises using BitLocker should treat the recovery keys as highly sensitive, and avoid default cloud backup unless there is a clear business requirement and the associated risks are well understood and mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The safest configuration is to redirect those keys to on-premises Active Directory or a controlled enterprise key vault. Even if stored in corporate-controlled directory or service such as Microsoft Entra ID or Intune, there should be strong governance on who can read the keys, with effective logging and just-in-time access, said Amit Jaju, a global partner at Ankura Consulting. This can cut Microsoft out of the recovery loop, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If keys have to reside in Microsoft’s cloud, use strong multi-factor authentication for admin roles, with conditional access and privileged-access workstations so a compromise of admin credentials does not automatically become a compromise of all keys, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises should ensure strict access control and separation of duties. “Only a small, vetted group such as security operations, endpoint engineering, should have rights to view or export recovery keys. Approvals should be workflow-based, not ad hoc. Every key retrieval should leave an auditable, immutable trail, and ideally be tied to an incident or ticket ID,” said Jaju.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should also ensure that when devices are repurposed, decommissioned, or moved across jurisdictions, keys should be regenerated as part of the workflow to ensure old keys cannot be used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gogia warned of the long tail of insecure setups. Personal accounts linked during provisioning, or BYOD devices that silently sync keys to consumer dashboards, are invisible pathways for leakage. “If those keys sit outside your boundary, you no longer have a clean chain of custody. That’s not a theoretical risk. It’s something auditors are now actively checking,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many breaches are not cryptographic but procedural, enterprises should have a formal playbook for when a recovery key can be used (lost PIN, internal investigation with legal approval, lawful order) and when it cannot (informal manager request to access an employee’s data), noted Jaju.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="geopolitics-reshaping-enterprise-data-and-key-control"&gt;Geopolitics reshaping enterprise data and key control&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical tensions are also reshaping global trade and technology policies, something enterprises increasingly need to factor into their security strategies. As governments assert greater control over data, trade secrets and proprietary information risk becoming entangled in broader state interests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gogia warned, “The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/568021/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-us-cloud-act-and-the-uk-copoa-act.html"&gt;US CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt; allows law enforcement to compel US-based providers to hand over data and keys, even if that data is hosted in Europe or Asia. Similarly, Chinese data localisation rules require keys and data to be accessible to state regulators. In India, recent legislation has introduced broad access rights for security agencies. And the EU is debating whether sovereignty must include key custody by design, not just data residency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If recovery keys are stored with a cloud provider, that provider may be compelled, at least in its home jurisdiction, to hand them over under lawful order, even if the data subject or company is elsewhere without notifying the company. This becomes even more critical from the point of view of a pharma company, semiconductor firm, defence contractor, or critical-infrastructure operator, as it exposes them to risks such as exposure of trade secrets in cross‑border investigations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaju added, “Enterprises should assume that where keys are held, they can potentially be compelled. So where practical, ensure that the entities controlling keys are legally anchored in the jurisdiction whose laws and due-process standards you trust most. Establish board-level oversight on cross-border data access, including a register of government data-access requests, where legally permitted. For multinational companies, legal and security teams must work together to understand mutual legal-assistance treaties, CLOUD Act implications, and local interception laws.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unplugged holes in the npm and yarn package managers could let attackers bypass defenses against Shai-Hulud</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4122436/unplugged-holes-in-the-npm-and-yarn-package-managers-could-let-attackers-bypass-defenses-against-shai-hulud-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Javascript developers should consider moving away from the npm and yarn platforms for distributing their work because newly-found holes allow threat actors to run malicious worm attacks like Shai-Hulud, says an Israeli researcher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The warning comes from &lt;a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/orenyomtov" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oren Yomtov&lt;/a&gt; of Koi Security, &lt;a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/packagegate-6-zero-days-in-js-package-managers-but-npm-wont-act" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;who blogged Monday of discovering&lt;/a&gt; six zero day vulnerabilities in several package managers that could allow hackers bypass defenses that had been recommended last November after Shai-Hulud roamed through npm and compromised over 700 packages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those defenses are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disabling the ability to run lifecycle scripts, commands that run automatically during package installation,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;saving lockfile integrity checks (package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, and others) to version control (git). The lockfile records the exact version and integrity hash of every package in a dependency tree. On subsequent installs, the package manager checks incoming packages against these hashes, and if something doesn’t match, installation fails. If an attacker compromises a package and pushes a malicious version, the integrity check should catch the mismatch and block it from being installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations “became the standard advice everywhere from GitHub security guides to corporate policy docs” after November, says Yomtov, “because if malicious code can’t run on install, and your dependency tree is pinned, you’re covered.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="novembers-advice-still-valid-but-more-issues-need-addressing"&gt;November’s advice still valid, but more issues need addressing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That advice is still valid, he added in an email interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the vulnerabilities he discovered — dubbed PackageGate — that allow hackers to get around those two defenses have to be addressed by all platforms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, the pnpm, vlt, and Bun platforms have addressed the bypass holes, Yomtov said, but npm and yarn haven’t. He therefore recommends that JavaScript developers use pnpm, vlt or Bun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that, in any case, JavaScript developers should keep whatever JavaScript package manager they use up to date to ensure they have the latest patches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="github-statement-bewildering"&gt;GitHub statement ‘bewildering’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which owns and oversees npm through GitHub, referred questions about the vulnerabilities to GitHub. It said in a statement, “We are actively working to address the new issue reported as npm actively scans for malware in the registry.” In the meantime, it urges project developers to adopt &lt;a href="https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/strengthening-supply-chain-security-preparing-for-the-next-malware-campaign/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the recommendations in this blog&lt;/a&gt; issued after the Shai-Hulud attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement also notes that, last September, &lt;a href="https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/our-plan-for-a-more-secure-npm-supply-chain/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub said it is strengthening npm’s security&lt;/a&gt;, including making changes to authentication and token management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GitHub also warns that that, if a package being installed through git contains a prepare script, its dependencies and devDependencies will be installed. “As we shared when the ticket was filed, this is an intentional design and works as expected. When users install a git dependency, they are trusting the entire contents of that repository, including its configuration files.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yomtov found this explanation of intentional design “bewildering.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="not-the-complete-picture"&gt;Not the complete picture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He says the scripts bypass vulnerability was reported through the HackerOne bug bounty program on November 26, 2025. While other JavaScript package managers accepted the reports, npm said the platform was working as intended, and that the ‘ignore scripts’ command should prevent the running of unapproved remote code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t write this post to shame anyone,” Yomtov said in the blog. “We wrote it because the JavaScript ecosystem deserves better, and because security decisions should be based on accurate information, not assumptions about defenses that don’t hold up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The standard advice, disable scripts and commit your lockfiles, is still worth following. But it’s not the complete picture,” he said. “Until PackageGate is fully addressed, organizations need to make their own informed choices about risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CNAPP-Kaufratgeber</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970431/cnapp-kaufratgeber.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud Sec Specialist 16z9" class="wp-image-3970439" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gorodenkoff_shutterstock_2287651213_16z9.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Gorodenkoff | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloud Security bleibt ein diffiziles Thema und die Tools, mit denen sie sich gewährleisten lässt, werden zunehmend komplexer und schwieriger zu durchschauen – auch dank der ungebrochenen Liebe der Branche zu &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3825034/4-wege-aus-der-security-akronymholle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Akronymen&lt;/a&gt;. Mit CNAPP kommt nun ein weiteres hinzu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="cnapp-definition"&gt;CNAPP – Definition&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Abkürzung steht für Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform – und kombiniert die Funktionen von vier separaten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495515/7-fundamentale-cloud-bedrohungen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud-Security&lt;/a&gt;-Werkzeugen:   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), um sämtliche Zugriffskontrollmaßnahmen und Risikomanagement-Tasks zu managen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), um Code in allen cloudbasierten Repositories abzusichern sowie Laufzeitschutz für die gesamte Entwicklungsumgebung und alle Code-Pipelines zu gewährleisten.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494345/der-kaufratgeber-fur-cloud-access-security-broker.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud Access Security Broker&lt;/a&gt; (CASB) für Authentifizierungs- und Encryption-Aufgaben.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495818/cloud-risiken-verwalten-so-wahlen-sie-das-passende-cspm-tool-aus.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud Security Posture Management&lt;/a&gt; (CSPM), das Threat Intelligence und Abhilfemaßnahmen kombiniert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Über diese vier „klassischen“ Elemente hat sich CNAPP inzwischen auch auf andere Bereiche ausgeweitet. Zum Beispiel:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495478/api-security-die-10-besten-api-tools.html" target="_blank"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;-, Skript-, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495329/cybersecurity-in-der-lieferkettewie-sie-ihre-software-supply-chain-schutzen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Supply-Chain&lt;/a&gt;– sowie Infrastructure-as-Code (&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/3853753/opentofu-der-killer-fork.html" target="_blank"&gt;IaC&lt;/a&gt;)-Sicherheit,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492006/kubernetes-security-wie-sie-ihre-cluster-besser-absichern.html"&gt;Container&lt;/a&gt;– und Serverless-Security, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;weitere Posture-Management-Tools, einschließlich Daten- und SaaS-Applikationen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aus Anwendersicht ist CNAPP damit sowohl schwer zu verstehen als auch diffizil zu evaluieren – und entsprechend schwer einzukaufen, wie Forrester-Chefanalyst Andras Cser in &lt;a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-cnapp-product-category-is-getting-crowded-with-capabilities/?ref_search=3408672_1741785037249" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;einem Blogbeitrag zum Thema&lt;/a&gt; nahelegt. Weil teilweise auch Security-Optionen außerhalb der Cloud abgedeckt würden, sei jede CNAPP-Kaufentscheidung und -Implementierung auch eine Team- oder abteilungsübergreifende Aufgabe, so der Analyst.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anders ausgedrückt: Geht‘s um CNAPP, muss eine ganze Menge Software abgestimmt, gemanagt, integriert und verstanden werden. Um Ihnen den Überblick zu erleichtern, haben wir die Details zu den wichtigsten Anbietern und Angeboten in diesem Kaufratgeber zusammengetragen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="der-cnapp-markt"&gt;Der CNAPP-Markt&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geprägt hat die Produktkategorie – beziehungsweise das Akronym – einmal mehr Gartner. Das Analystenhaus verwendete den Begriff CNAPP erstmals in seinem &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4005115" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;„Innovation Insight“-Report&lt;/a&gt; aus dem August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Schlüssel zum Verständnis dieser Produktkategorie liegt in den Integrationsherausforderungen für Unternehmensanwender: Im „&lt;a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/state-of-observability-2022-modernization" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;State of Observability Report&lt;/a&gt;“ von VMware geben 57 Prozent der Befragten an, dass innerhalb einer typischen Cloud-Anwendung bis zu 50 verschiedene Technologien zum Einsatz kommen – die im Schnitt mit zehn Monitoring-Tools gemanagt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Und laut dem „&lt;a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/info/reports/state-of-observability-2024/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Observability Report 2024&lt;/a&gt;“ (Download gegen Daten) von Dynatrace besteht eine typische Enterprise-Umgebung im Schnitt aus einem Dutzend unterschiedlichen Cloud-Plattformen, wobei regelmäßig ein Mix aus Private-, Public- und Hybrid-Cloud-Strategien zur Anwendung kommt. Hinzu kommen dann noch verschiedene Instanzen virtueller Maschinen, Kubernetes-Container sowie Serverless- und Microservices-Tools.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese erhebliche Integrationsbelastung könnte auch ein Grund dafür sein, dass der CNAPP-Markt im zweiten Quartal 2024 ein Gesamtvolumen von 700 Millionen Dollar erreicht hat und damit im Jahresvergleich um 42 Prozent gewachsen ist – wie die Analysten der Dell’Oro Group &lt;a href="https://www.delloro.com/news/cnapp-market-grows-42-percent-in-2q-2024-as-cloud-security-remains-a-top-concern/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;berichten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="cnapp-anbieter-und-ihre-angebote"&gt;CNAPP-Anbieter und ihre Angebote&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Idealfall sollte eine CNAPP-Lösung:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fehlkonfigurationen reduzieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;das Security-Niveau der Entwicklungspipeline optimieren, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;effektiv automatisieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Anbieter verfolgen mit Blick auf CNAPP zwei unterschiedliche Ansätze: Entweder sie fokussieren die &lt;strong&gt;DevSecOps&lt;/strong&gt;– oder die &lt;strong&gt;traditionelle IT-Security-Perspektive&lt;/strong&gt;. Ersteres hat einen stärkeren Fokus auf den Schutz der Applikationen selbst zur Folge (CIEM/CWPP), letzteres eine Ausweitung traditioneller Schutzmaßnahmen auf Netzwerkebene (CASB/CSPM). Bislang deckt kein CNAPP-Offering wirklich konsequent alle vier Bereiche ab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natürlich spielt künstliche Intelligenz (KI) auch in diesem Bereich zunehmend eine Rolle: Diverse CNAPP-Anbieter integrieren, beziehungsweise kombinieren KI-Agenten und agentenlose Lösungen in ihren Produkten, um ein umfassenderes Monitoring und eine möglichst breite Abdeckung und Scalability zu bieten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preisgefüge: verschiedene Preispläne, die sich nach den Workloads richten;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-fragen-vor-dem-cnapp-investment"&gt;5 Fragen vor dem CNAPP-Investment&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bevor Sie sich für einen dieser CNAPP-Anbieter entscheiden, sollten Sie sich folgende Fragen stellen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welche Cloud-Artefakte lassen sich mit der gewählten Lösung scannen?&lt;/strong&gt; Einige Produkte (Lacework) fokussieren auf die drei großen IaaS-Anbieter, andere (Tigera) unterstützen nur die Kubernetes-Dienste der Hyperscaler. Wieder andere (Sysdig) nehmen vor allem Container und die verschiedenen Linux-Server, auf denen diese laufen, in den Fokus. Vor allem kommt es jedoch darauf an, die Artefakte kontinuierlich und (nahezu) in Echtzeit überwachen zu können.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wie werden Sicherheitsvorfälle gemeldet?&lt;/strong&gt; Gibt es separate Zugriffsregeln, damit sich verschiedene Mitarbeiter auf bestimmte Bereiche konzentrieren können? Gibt es separate oder kombinierte, vordefinierte Sicherheitsrichtlinien, um Daten mit und ohne Agenten zu erfassen? Wie aussagekräftig sind die Dashboards und die Visualisierungen, die diese liefern?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inwieweit werden die vier Management-Tool-Bereiche abgedeckt&lt;/strong&gt;? Einige Angebote bieten CWPP- und CSPM-Elemente, müssen aber, etwa für Kubernetes-Support, erweitert werden.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welche DevOps-Frameworks werden unterstützt? &lt;/strong&gt;Wie sieht es mit Blick auf Open-Source-&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492659/datenlecks-finden-so-verhindern-sie-repository-leaks.html" target="_blank"&gt;Repositories&lt;/a&gt; aus?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wie viel kostet die Lösung konkret? &lt;/strong&gt;Nur wenige CNAPP-Anbieter bieten eine wirklich transparente Preisgestaltung. Insbesondere bei komplexen Preismodellen (Data Theorem, Qualys, Orca) besteht deshalb Klärungsbedarf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(fm)&lt;/p&gt;
