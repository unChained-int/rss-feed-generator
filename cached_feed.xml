      <title>Iranian APT Prince of Persia returns with new malware and C2 infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109985/iranian-apt-prince-of-persia-returns-with-new-malware-and-c2-infrastructure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered new activity from a threat actor dubbed Prince of Persia that’s believed to be tied to the Iranian government. The group appeared to have gone dormant in 2022 after multiple security companies documented its operations and crippled its command-and-control infrastructure, but new evidence shows the attackers retooled and continued to target new victims under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prince of Persia, also known as Infy based on the name of its original malware, has been operating for almost 20 years. Researchers have noted likely ties to Iran based on the group’s target selection and other factors. Victims were previously identified in 35 countries and included Iranian dissidents and government targets from Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first company to &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prince-of-persia-infy-malware-active-in-decade-of-targeted-attacks/"&gt;document the group’s attacks and malware toolkit in detail was Palo Alto Networks back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. That same year the company &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-of-persia-game-over/"&gt;executed a successful takedown operation&lt;/a&gt; that involved sinkholing the group’s command-and control servers. However, the group was back one year later with new malware variants dubbed Foudre and Tonnerre — lighting and thunder in French.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite the appearance of having gone dark in 2022, Prince of Persia threat actors have done quite the opposite,” researchers from security firm SafeBreach said in &lt;a href="https://www.safebreach.com/blog/prince-of-persia-a-decade-of-an-iranian-nation-state-apt-campaign-activity"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;. “Our ongoing research campaign into this prolific and elusive group has highlighted critical details about their activities, C2 servers, and identified malware variants in the last three years. This threat group is still active, relevant, and dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="changes-in-malware-delivery-and-c2-infrastructure"&gt;Changes in malware delivery and C2 infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the group fell off the radar in 2022, the latest known version of Foudre was v27 and for Tonnerre it was v15. Today, the most recent versions recovered by researchers are Foudre v34 and Tonnerre v17, both of which include significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foudre is first-stage malware used for reconnaissance and victim identification. If a target is deemed important enough, the Tonnerre Trojan is deployed for data exfiltration and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foudre used to be distributed through malicious macros embedded in Microsoft Office documents sent as attachments in phishing emails on topics of interest to their targets. The latest version is delivered as an Excel file with an embedded malicious executable that’s not detected by any antivirus engine on VirusTotal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The embedded executable is a self-extracting archive (SFX) file that contains a malicious DLL and a decoy MP4 video file. Excel files with malicious macros continue to be used and they attempt to execute a file called ccupdate.tmp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major difference compared to previous versions is the switch to a new domain generation algorithm (DGA) through which the malware determines on which domain names it will find the command-and-control server. Tonnerre v17 uses the same DGA with a different key prefix, meaning the domains it will generate for C2 will be different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SafeBreach researchers managed to identify many C2 servers and to extract data from them. Some servers were used for testing while other had data collected from real victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the victims were located in Iran, but there were some across Europe and countries like Iraq, Turkey, India, and Canada,” the researchers said. “While we have chosen not to publish the data here due to privacy concerns, we are more than willing to share the data with authorized law enforcement agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the group’s campaigns is difficult because the attackers switch C2 servers quite often and they issue commands to delete the malware from the systems of victims that are no longer of interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-shift-to-telegram"&gt;A shift to Telegram&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, the researchers identified a new Tonnerre variant that’s advertised as v50, as well as an unknown new Foudre version that goes along with it. These versions use a new C2 server structure and, most importantly, can download a file from the server that enables Telegram communication via its API.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Telegram feature is enabled only for a select number of victims, but the researchers managed to use the API to query the configured Telegram channel. It had two members, one of which was a channel bot and one user named Ehsan written in Farsi, who could be one of the hackers in charge of controlling the malware and who was last active as of Dec. 13.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ehsan is a common Persian name typical for an Iranian,” the researchers said. “This attribution is pretty strong in combination with the IP location of the attacker’s testing machine. We tracked the IP addresses used over several years, all of which indicated Iran as the location. While different IP location databases provided different cities, all of them were in Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered other samples of malware and payloads used in campaigns prior to 2022, including signs of an additional malware family called Rugissement (roar in French), a newer version of MaxPinner, a Telegram-based trojan used by the group in 2021, as well as various trojanized binaries used to distribute the malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report includes details about the new DGA algorithms as well as indicators of compromise and sample hashes in hopes it will help other companies and researchers track the elusive group’s activities going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <title>Dismantling Defenses: Trump 2.0 Cyber Year in Review</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/12/dismantling-defenses-trump-2-0-cyber-year-in-review/</link>
      <description>The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation’s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Firm stand against migrant smuggling: global alliance convened in Brussels</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/firm-stand-against-migrant-smuggling-global-alliance-convened-in-brussels</link>
      <description>On 10 December 2025, Europol participated in the second International Conference of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, hosted by the European Commission. Over 80 delegations, including EU Member States, EU agencies, third party countries, international organisations, and private parties attended the event. During this high-level conference, over 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen cooperation along migrant smuggling routes and tackle the growing digital dimension of these criminal activities. The declaration underscores new preventive measures, including a crackdown on online advertisements promoting migrant smuggling and the disruption of underground banking systems fuelling the criminal business.</description>

      <title>WatchGuard fixes ‘critical’ zero-day allowing firewall takeover</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109884/watchguard-fixes-critical-zero-day-allowing-firewall-takeover.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WatchGuard has issued an urgent patch alert for its Firebox firewall appliances after discovering a critical-rated vulnerability that is under exploit by threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracked as &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14733" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-14733&lt;/a&gt;, with a CVSS score of 9.3, the flaw is an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability affecting the iked process, a WatchGuard Fireware OS component responsible for the IKEv2 key exchange in IPSec VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00027" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WatchGuard advisory&lt;/a&gt;, this weakness could “allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code,” taking control of the appliance through remote code execution (RCE) without having to log in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because it was under attack before a patch was made available by WatchGuard on December 18, this makes CVE-2025-14733 a bona fide zero-day vulnerability. The first job for admins should therefore be to check Firebox appliances for signs of current or recent compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WatchGuard’s advisory lists four IP addresses associated with exploitation; outbound traffic to them is “a strong indicator of compromise,” while inbound connections from them “could indicate reconnaissance efforts or exploit attempts,” the advisory said. With logging enabled, other strong indicators were an IKE_AUTH request log message with an abnormally large CERT payload greater than 2,000 bytes, or evidence of an iked process hang, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Affected Fireware OS versions are 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3, 12.0 up to and including 12.11.5, and legacy 11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resolved versions are 2025.1.4, 12.11.6, 12.5.15 (T15 &amp;amp; T35 models), and 12.3.1_Update4 (B728352) for the FIPS-certified release. There is no fix for 11.x, which is considered &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-trust-center/end-of-life-policy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;end of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, WatchGuard warned, patching may not be enough: “If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And some admins have even more post-patching tasks to perform, it said, noting, “in addition to installing the latest Fireware OS that contains the fix, administrators that have confirmed threat actor activity on their Firebox appliances must take precautions to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable Firebox appliances.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deja-vu"&gt;Deja vu&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, WatchGuard patched a similar &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059623/watchguard-patches-critical-vpn-flaw-in-firewalls-that-could-lead-to-compromise.html" target="_blank"&gt;Firebox vulnerability, CVE-2025-9242&lt;/a&gt;, also affecting the iked VPN configuration and given a CVSS score of 9.3. At the time, WatchGuard said there were no reports of active exploitation, but by October, the company had &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00015" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revised this assessment&lt;/a&gt; after exploitation attempts were detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder not to read initial vulnerability assessments for this type of infrastructure too optimistically — exploitation is frequently detected after a flaw has been made public. Firewalls and VPNs are major targets for cybercriminals, and every significant vulnerability in them represents a clear and present cyber security risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the evidence shows that some WatchGuard customers don’t patch vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. In October, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Shadowserver/status/1979902019696509099" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a scan by The Shadowserver Foundation&lt;/a&gt; found that over 71,000 Firebox appliances had not yet been patched for CVE-2025-9242, including 23,000 in the US. Despite its zero-day status, it’s likely to be a similar story for CVE-2025-14733.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slow or reluctant patching might also explain why Russian-aligned ‘Sandworm’ hackers were recently discovered to be &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4107406/russian-apt-group-pivots-to-network-edge-device-misconfigurations.html" target="_blank"&gt;targeting WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances&lt;/a&gt; by exploiting CVEs dating back several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Würfel mit Smiley und Gegenteil davon" class="wp-image-4106445" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2597723115_16.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Die Redaktion von Computerwoche, CIO und CSO sieht das IT-Jahr 2025 mit gemischten Gefühlen zu Ende gehen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;abdullah Ghashqeen – Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein turbulentes Jahr 2025 neigt sich dem Ende zu. Es war geprägt von wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit, geopolitischen Spannungen und dem ungebremsten Siegeszug der Künstlichen Intelligenz. Grund genug für die Redaktion von Computerwoche, CIO und CSO, in der letzten TechTalk-Podcast-Folge des Jahres Bilanz zu ziehen. Im Fokus: Die IT-Tops und -Flops 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kaum ein Thema hat die IT-Welt 2025 so stark dominiert wie KI – mit Licht und Schatten. Einer der größten Flops des Jahres ist dabei der massive Stellenabbau, der vielerorts mit dem Verweis auf KI begründet wird. Laut &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4087301/ki-hat-2025-schon-mehr-als-200-000-jobs-gekostet.html" target="_blank"&gt;einer Analyse von Surfshark&lt;/a&gt; haben weltweit mindestens 200.000 Menschen infolge des KI-Booms ihren Job verloren – vermutlich sind es sogar deutlich mehr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-grose-versprechen-bittere-realitat"&gt;KI: Große Versprechen, bittere Realität&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Groteske daran, betont Manfred Bremmer, Editorial Manager Computerwoche: „Oft sind solche Entlassungsrunden eine Mogelpackung. Teilweise wurden später wieder Mitarbeitende eingestellt, weil sich eben doch nicht alles automatisieren lässt.“ Auch mit Blick auf die Zukunft sei das Vorgehen alles andere als nachhaltig, so Bremmer, weil vor allem Junior-Jobs wegfallen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einen weiteren KI-spezifischen Flop bringt sein Kollege Tristan Fincken ins Spiel: Cyberkriminelle nutzen KI zunehmend zur Automatisierung von Angriffen. Während Angreifer dadurch schneller und effizienter werden, kämpfen Unternehmen und Sicherheitsverantwortliche häufig mehr mit regulatorischen Vorgaben als mit technischen Lösungen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cios-bleiben-pragmatisch"&gt;CIOs bleiben pragmatisch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Lichtblick im KI-Bereich hebt Jens Dose, Editor in Chief bei CIO.de, hervor: Trotz vollmundiger KI-Versprechen in den Marketing-Botschaften der Anbieter würden sich viele IT-Verantwortliche weiterhin auf die Basics konzentrieren, nämlich Datenqualität, Datensichtbarkeit, stabile Prozesse und belastbare Infrastrukturen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch innovatives Change-Management im KI-Kontext sticht aus seiner Sicht positiv hervor – etwa beim Schweizer TK-Anbieter Mobilezone, der KI-Agenten nicht wie Software, sondern &lt;a href="https://www.cio.de/article/4087439/mobilzone-gibt-ki-agenten-ein-gesicht.html" target="_blank"&gt;wie neue Mitarbeiter behandelt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="digitale-souveranitat-zwischen-anspruch-und-wirklichkeit"&gt;Digitale Souveränität zwischen Anspruch und Wirklichkeit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Thema digitale Souveränität bleibt 2025 ambivalent. Positiv bewertet Computerwoche-Redakteur Jürgen Hill etwa das &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4070327/ai-first-die-neue-ki-strategie-der-eu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rennen um KI-Gigafactories in Europa&lt;/a&gt;. So investiere Schwarz IT elf Milliarden Euro in ein Rechenzentrum, um eine souveräne Alternative zu US-Hyperscalern zu schaffen. Auch die Gründung eines Digitalministeriums soll die Digitalisierungsbemühungen von Bund und Ländern besser koordinieren – wenngleich Hill &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4097392/deutschlands-digitalpolitik-mehr-symbol-als-substanz.html" target="_blank"&gt;angesichts des geplanten Etat&lt;/a&gt;s seine Zweifel an der Effektivität der Behörde hat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Als Vorzeigeprojekt in Sachen Digitale Souveränität gilt Schleswig-Holstein: Das Bundesland setzt in der Landesverwaltung konsequent auf Open Source und verabschiedet sich schrittweise von Microsoft. Ab 2026 sollen so jährlich über 15 Millionen Euro an Lizenzkosten eingespart und gleichzeitig Abhängigkeiten von Tech-Giganten reduziert werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demgegenüber steht ein deutlicher Flop im FreistaatBayern. Dieser plant, sich langfristig an Microsoft 365 zu binden. Kostenpunkt: fast eine Milliarde Euro über fünf Jahre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-lichtblicke-trotz-regulatorischem-chaos"&gt;Security: Lichtblicke trotz regulatorischem Chaos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich IT-Sicherheit fällt die Bilanz gemischt aus, urteilt Julia Mutzbauer, Editorial Manager bei der CSO. So sollte NIS2 eigentlich EU-weit für einheitliche Standards sorgen, sorgt in der Praxis aber für Verunsicherung: Unterschiedliche nationale Umsetzungen, unklare Zuständigkeiten und abgeschwächte Vorgaben – etwa beim Schwachstellenmanagement – stießen auf breite Kritik.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gleichzeitig gebe es aber in 2025 auch Erfolge zu vermelden, betont sie. Internationale Ermittlungen hätten zur Zerschlagung der Ransomware-Gruppe 8Base, zur Abschaltung krimineller Infrastrukturen im Rahmen der Operation Endgame sowie zur Stilllegung gefährlicher Malware geführt. Auch mit der Operation „Olympia“ wurde eine große Geldwäsche-Plattform vom Netz genommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angesichts dieser vielfältigen Entwicklungen bleibt mit Spannung zu erwarten, was 2026 in der IT-Welt passieren wird. Wir wünschen frohe Feiertage und halten Sie auch im neuen Jahr auf unseren Kanälen auf dem Laufenden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>6 wichtige Punkte für Ihren Incident Response Plan</title>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Teamarbeit" class="wp-image-3842992" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2478767635.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lesen Sie, welche Schritte für Ihren Notfallplan besonders wichtig sind.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;PeopleImages.com – Yuri A – Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein Unternehmen einen größeren Ausfall seiner IT-Systeme erlebt – beispielsweise aufgrund eines Cyberangriffs – ist es zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht mehr voll geschäftsfähig. Deshalb ist ein effektiver Plan zur Reaktion auf Vorfälle (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494979/was-ist-ein-incident-response-retainer.html"&gt;Incident Response&lt;/a&gt;, IR) unerlässlich.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es geht jedoch nicht nur darum, die Quelle eines Angriffs zu finden und ihn einzudämmen. Unternehmen müssen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2111061/cyber-resilience-a-business-imperative-cisos-must-get-right.html"&gt;auf Widerstandsfähigkeit ausgelegt sein&lt;/a&gt;, um auch dann weiterarbeiten zu können, wenn wichtige Systeme nicht mehr verfügbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Was gehört zu einem effektiven Incident Response Plan? Hier sind sechs wesentliche Komponenten:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folgen abschätzen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn eine Sicherheitsverletzung wichtige Systeme zum Erliegen bringt, müssen Unternehmen über einen soliden IT-Ausfallsicherheits- oder &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/288554/best-practices-how-to-create-an-effective-business-continuity-plan.html"&gt;Business-Continuity-Plan (BC)&lt;/a&gt; verfügen. Selbst wenn das Unternehmen nur für ein paar Stunden ausfällt, kann dies zu &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567697/what-is-the-cost-of-a-data-breach-3.html"&gt;großen finanziellen Verlusten&lt;/a&gt; und einer negativen PR führen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Eine der wichtigsten Komponenten ist es, die wesentlichen Funktionen zu verstehen, die Ihr Unternehmen erfüllt, und welche Auswirkungen es hätte, wenn diese gestört würden“, betont Justin Kates, leitender Business-Continuity-Berater für den Betreiber von Convenience-Stores Wawa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Dies geschieht in der Regel durch eine sogenannte Business Impact Analysis (BIA)“, ergänzt der Experte. “Einige im Bereich der Geschäftskontinuität sind der Meinung, dass die BIA kein hilfreiches Mittel ist. Sie hilft jedoch dem Verantwortlichen für Business Continuity , ein besseres Verständnis dafür zu bekommen, wie Prozesse im gesamten Unternehmen funktionieren.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die BIA katalogisiert jeden Prozess und ermittelt, welche Auswirkungen in bestimmten Intervallen je nach Dauer eines Geschäftsausfalls zu erwarten sind. Laut Kates können dabei Workarounds mit manuellen Schritten zur Durchführung des Prozesses oder die Nutzung alternativer Dienste zur Erfüllung von Mindestanforderungen hilfreich sein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schon im Vorfeld sollte klar sein, welche Teile des Unternehmens für den Betrieb am wichtigsten sind. „Nach Meinung von Adam Ennamli, Chief Risk, Compliance and Security Officer bei der General Bank of Canada, besteht die Grundlage eines jeden effektiven Notfallplans darin, „sein Unternehmen wirklich zu verstehen – von den Menschen über die Prozesse bis hin zum Betrieb, und zwar durch eine detaillierte und pragmatische Folgenabschätzung.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Security-Spezialist fügt hinzu: „Wenn man über BIA und RTOs [Recovery Time Objective] spricht, sollte man nicht nur Kästchen ankreuzen. Sie erstellen eine Karte, die Ihnen und Ihren Entscheidungsträgern genau zeigt, worauf Sie sich konzentrieren müssen, wenn etwas schief geht.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Enmamil behandeln allerdings viele Organisationen ihre Systeme als gleich kritisch. „Und wenn es bei einem tatsächlichen Vorfall darauf ankommt, wird wertvolle Zeit mit weniger wichtigen Ressourcen verschwendet, während kritische Geschäftsfunktionen offline bleiben und keine Einnahmen bringen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Umfassende Kommunikationsstrategie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein weiteres Schlüsselelement, das über Erfolg oder Misserfolg einer Strategie zur Reaktion auf Vorfälle entscheiden kann, ist die Kommunikation. Ohne klare Kommunikation zwischen den wichtigsten Interessengruppen des Unternehmens kann es zu viel längeren Ausfallzeiten oder zum Verlust wichtiger Prozesse über längere Zeiträume kommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Es geht nicht nur darum, eine Telefonkette oder eine Liste mit E-Mail-Adressen zu haben. Sie benötigen vorab genehmigte Inhaltsblöcke und Vorlagen für verschiedene Szenarien, [mehrere] Backup-Kommunikationskanäle und klare Entscheidungs- und Delegationsstrukturen. Es muss klar sein, wer was zu wem sagen darf“, betont Ennamil. „Wenn ein Vorfall eintritt, ist das Letzte, was Sie wollen, Pressemitteilungen zu verfassen, Massen-E-Mails zu versenden oder herauszufinden, wie Sie Ihr Team erreichen können, weil Ihre primären Kanäle ausgefallen sind.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Wingate, CEO von Emerald Ocean fügt hinzu, dass Unternehmen über &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574541/the-role-of-cisos-in-the-communication-response-following-an-incident.html"&gt;solide Kommunikationsprotokolle&lt;/a&gt; verfügen sollten. „Sie werden sich eine klare Befehlskette und Kommunikation wünschen“, sagt er. „Ohne festgelegte Protokolle sind Sie in etwa so effektiv wie bei dem Versuch, eine Brandbekämpfung mit Rauchzeichen zu koordinieren.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Schwere des Vorfalls sollte die Kommunikationsstrategie bestimmen, ergänzt David Taylor, Geschäftsführer des globalen Beratungsunternehmens Protiviti. „Während die Mitglieder des Cybersicherheitsteams in engem Kontakt stehen und zusammenarbeiten, sind andere wahrscheinlich nicht so gut eingebunden oder nicht so gut informiert.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taylor führt aus: „Je nach Schweregrad sollte die Art, das Publikum und die Häufigkeit der Kommunikation von der Unternehmensführung vorgegeben werden.“ Dies ermögliche es den Verantwortlichen für Cybersicherheit und anderen Führungskräften, einen einheitlichen Zeitrahmen zu entwickeln, in dem sie mit Updates rechnen können. „Gemeinsam können sich die technischen Einsatzteams auf die Reaktion konzentrieren, ohne den Fortschritt zu stoppen, um ad hoc Updates bereitzustellen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einer der wichtigsten Schritte ist die Ernennung eines Kommunikationsleiters , merkt Business-Continuity-Berater Kate an. „Wenn Technologiesysteme nicht verfügbar sind, müssen viele innerhalb der Organisation Workarounds implementieren, um wesentliche Prozesse am Laufen zu halten.“ Dem Experten zufolge basieren viele Entscheidungen auf Updates, die über den Status des Vorfalls und die erwarteten Lösungszeiten bereitgestellt werden. „Die Technologieteams werden sich darauf konzentrieren, die Auswirkungen des Vorfalls zu mildern, und haben möglicherweise nicht die Zeit, Updates bereitzustellen“, so Kates. „In Ihren Plänen sollte festgelegt sein, wer die Führung bei der Weitergabe von Updates an interne und externe Interessengruppen übernimmt, einschließlich der Aktualisierung, wenn es möglicherweise keine neuen Informationen gibt.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Klare Strukturen mit definierten Reaktionsrollen und Arbeitsabläufen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, wer nach einem Vorfall wofür verantwortlich ist. „Wenn ein Cybervorfall eintritt, ist Verwirrung der größte Feind“, so der CEO von Emerald Ocean. “Ein Team ohne definierte Rollen wird wie ein Orchester ohne Dirigenten herumlaufen. Bei Vorfällen kostet Verwirrung Zeit, und wenn ein Vorfall eintritt, ist Zeit alles.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Struktur und Rollen sollten über die Cybersecurity- oder IT-Mitarbeiter hinausgehen. „Der größte Irrglaube in der Cybersicherheit ist, dass es sich nur um ein IT-Problem handelt“, mahnt Wingate. Die IR-Struktur und die Rollen sollten idealerweise Vertreter aus dem gesamten Unternehmen umfassen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Zu den wichtigsten Rollen im Bereich Cybersicherheit gehören unter anderem der CIO/CTO, der CISO, der Einsatzleiter, der Koordinator für Vorfälle, der Endpunktanalyst, der Netzwerkanalyst und die externe forensische Unterstützung“, fasst Taylor zusammen. Zu den Rollen außerhalb der Cybersicherheit sollten das Krisenmanagementteam und möglicherweise Vertreter aus den Bereichen Recht, Unternehmenskommunikation, Personalwesen, Finanzen und andere gehören, je nach Ausmaß des Vorfalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Es ist wichtig festzulegen, wer welche dieser Rollen übernimmt, und die damit verbundenen Verantwortlichkeiten sollten ebenfalls klar definiert und in den entsprechenden Plänen leicht nachzuschlagen sein“, betont Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Rocco Grillo, Geschäftsführer der Unternehmensberatungsfirma Alvarez &amp;amp; Marsal Disputes and Investigations , ist es auch wichtig, dass „die wichtigsten externen Interessengruppen identifiziert werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Dazu gehören externe Anwälte, IR- und forensische Ermittlungsunternehmen, Cyber-Versicherungskontakte, Benachrichtigungs- und Kreditüberwachungsunternehmen, Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Ransomware-Verhandlungsunternehmen“, so  der Leiter der globalen Praxis für Cyberrisiken und Incident Response Services des Unternehmens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Überblick über die gesamte Bedrohungslandschaft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Bedrohungslandschaft im Bereich der Cybersicherheit ist breit gefächert und komplex. Wirksame IR-Strategien müssen so konzipiert werden, dass sie dieser Komplexität gerecht werden. Angriffe können von einer wachsenden Zahl von Quellen ausgehen und nicht nur ein Unternehmen, sondern auch seine Lieferanten und andere Geschäftspartner betreffen. „Der Fokus liegt mehr auf Angriffen auf die Lieferkette als auf direkten Angriffen auf Unternehmen“, ergänzt Grillo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492156/was-ist-ein-supply-chain-angriff.html"&gt;Angriffe auf die Lieferkette&lt;/a&gt; sind so, als würde ein Einbrecher in das Büro des Hausmeisters einbrechen, um sich die Schlüssel für alle Wohnungen im Gebäude zu verschaffen”, erläutert der Unternehmensberater, “im Gegensatz zu einem Einbrecher, der nur in das Penthouse des Gebäudes einbricht, um die Kronjuwelen zu stehlen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus müssen sich IR-Pläne nicht nur auf externe Bedrohungen konzentrieren, sondern auch auf &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493598/datenklau-durch-mitarbeiter-wer-ist-ihre-groste-insider-bedrohung.html"&gt;Insider-Bedrohungen&lt;/a&gt;. „Insider-Bedrohungsrisiken beschränken sich nicht nur auf böswillige Mitarbeiter, sondern auch auf Mitarbeiter, die menschliche Fehler begehen und/oder unwissentlich Cyber-Risiken für ihre Unternehmen schaffen, die Bedrohungsakteure ausnutzen können“, ergänzt Grillo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495375/third-party-risk-management-so-vermeiden-sie-compliance-unheil.html"&gt;Drittanbieter und Lieferanten&lt;/a&gt; würden in diese Kategorie fallen. „Dritte können autorisierten Zugang zu einem Unternehmen haben. Wenn sie von einem Bedrohungsakteur kompromittiert werden, schaffen sie diesen versehentlich Zugang“, so der Berater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regelmäßige Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen müssen ihre Pläne zur Reaktion auf Vorfälle und zur Geschäftskontinuität regelmäßig testen, um sicherzustellen, dass sie wirksam sind. „Das sollte eigentlich selbstverständlich sein: Wie bei allem anderen in der Technik auch, sollte man alles erst einmal testen“, fordert Wingate von Emerald Ocean. “Wenn Sie aus einem Flugzeug springen, möchten Sie ja auch, dass Ihr Fallschirm vorher überprüft wurde.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einer der Gründe, warum regelmäßige Tests so wichtig sind, ist die sich ständig verändernde Cybersicherheitslandschaft. „Meiner Erfahrung nach liegt der Schlüssel zu einer effektiven Wiederherstellung darin, Incident-Response-Pläne nicht als statische Dokumente zu betrachten und sie regelmäßig einem Stresstest zu unterziehen“, erklärt Ennamli von der General Bank of Canada. “Der Dreh- und Angelpunkt liegt darin, über die theoretische Planung hinauszugehen und praktische, getestete Schritte zu unternehmen, die sich unter Druck bewährt haben.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nach jedem Sicherheitsvorfall müssen die IR- und BC-Teams des Unternehmens überprüfen, wie gut die Pläne umgesetzt wurden und wo Verbesserungen vorgenommen werden können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Nach der Wiederherstellung nach einem Vorfall [und] Übungen des Vorfallsreaktionsprogramms muss eine disziplinierte Auswertung der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse erfolgen“, so Taylor von Protiviti. „Diese werden allgemein als After-Action-Reviews (AARs), Post-Incident-Reviews (PIRs), Hotwashes oder Debriefings bezeichnet. Unabhängig von der Bezeichnung ist ein disziplinierter und dokumentierter Ansatz zur Bewältigung sowohl positiver als auch negativer Aspekte nach einem Vorfall für eine kontinuierliche Verbesserung von entscheidender Bedeutung.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Einfachheit und Modularität sollten im Vordergrund stehen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obwohl die Bedrohungslandschaft komplex ist, müssen IR- und BC-Strategien dies nicht sein. Manchmal ist einfacher besser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Wir sehen in der Regel, dass Organisationen zahlreiche, hundertseitige Ordner für ihre Notfallpläne erstellen, einen für die Reaktion auf Vorfälle, einen anderen für die Geschäftskontinuität, einen weiteren für die Notfallwiederherstellung“, beschreibt Kates von Wawa. „Die meisten dieser Pläne überschneiden sich erheblich und sind nur kopierte Vorlagen, die sie online gefunden haben.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anstatt für jede Art von Vorfall separate, umständliche Pläne zu erstellen, empfiehlt Kates einen modularen ‘Playbook“-Ansatz. „Man kann einige wenige gefahrenspezifische Playbooks entwickeln – Ransomware, Stromausfall, Unwetter –, die gängige Funktionen der Reaktion auf Vorfälle [wie] Kommunikation, Lagebewertung, Umgehung von Geschäftsprozessen – sofort einsatzbereit machen“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dieser Ansatz ermögliche es den Teams, relevante Maßnahmen je nach Art des Vorfalls zu aktivieren und zu kombinieren, wodurch ein nützlicherer Plan entsteht. „Ich habe festgestellt, dass es auch viel einfacher ist, als mehrere große Pläne zu verwalten, um sicherzustellen, dass die Informationen aktuell bleiben“, sagt er. “Die Strategiebücher enthalten Checklisten und Entscheidungsbäume, die die Einsatzkräfte durch komplexe Verfahren führen und so die kognitive Überlastung während einer Krise reduzieren.“ (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
