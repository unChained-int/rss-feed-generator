      <title>Google Vertex AI security permissions could amplify insider threats</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4118092/google-vertex-ai-security-permissions-could-amplify-insider-threats.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The finding of fresh privilege-escalation vulnerabilities in Google’s Vertex AI is a stark reminder to CISOs that managing AI service agents is a task unlike any that they have encountered before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;XM Cyber reported two different issues with Vertex AI on Thursday, in which default configurations allow low-privileged users to pivot into higher-privileged Service Agent roles. But, it said, Google told it the system is just working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The OWASP Agentic Top 10 just &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109123/managing-agentic-ai-risk-lessons-from-the-owasp-top-10.html#:~:text=3%20%E2%80%93%20Identity%20and%20Privilege%20Abuse"&gt;codified identity and privilege abuse as ASI03&lt;/a&gt; and Google immediately gave us a case study,” said &lt;a href="https://www.rockcyber.com/about-us"&gt;Rock Lambros&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of security firm RockCyber. “We’ve seen this movie before. &lt;a href="https://orca.security/resources/blog/azure-machine-learning-privilege-escalation/"&gt;Orca found &lt;/a&gt;Azure Storage privilege escalation, Microsoft called it ‘by design.’ &lt;a href="https://avd.aquasec.com/misconfig/aws/sagemaker"&gt;Aqua found&lt;/a&gt; AWS SageMaker lateral movement paths, AWS said ‘operating as expected.’ Cloud providers have turned ‘shared responsibility’ into a liability shield for their own insecure defaults. CISOs need to stop trusting that ‘managed’ means ‘secured’ and start auditing every service identity attached to their AI workloads, because the vendors clearly aren’t doing it for you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://greyhoundresearch.com/svg/"&gt;Sanchit Vir Gogia&lt;/a&gt;, chief analyst at Greyhound Research, said the report is “a window into how the trust model behind Google’s Vertex AI is fundamentally misaligned with enterprise security principles.” In these platforms, he said, “Managed service agents are granted sweeping permissions so AI features can function out of the box. But that convenience comes at the cost of visibility and control. These service identities operate in the background, carry project-wide privileges, and can be manipulated by any user who understands how the system behaves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google didn’t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerabilities, &lt;a href="https://xmcyber.com/blog/double-agent-service-agent-privilege-escalation-in-google-vertex-ai/"&gt;XM Cyber explained in its report&lt;/a&gt;, lie in how privileges are allocated to different roles associated with Vertex AI. “Central to this is the role of Service Agents: special service accounts created and managed by Google Cloud that allow services to access your resources and perform internal processes on your behalf. Because these invisible managed identities are required for services to function, they are often automatically granted broad project-wide permissions,” it said. “These vulnerabilities allow an attacker with minimal permissions to hijack high-privileged Service Agents, effectively turning these invisible managed identities into double agents that facilitate privilege escalation. When we disclosed the findings to Google, their rationale was that the services are currently ‘working as intended.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;XM Cyber found that someone with control over an identity with even minimal privileges consistent with Vertex AI’s “Viewer” role, the lowest level of privilege, could in certain circumstances manipulate the system to retrieve the access token for the service agent and use its privileges in the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gogia said the issue is alarming. “When a cloud provider says that a low-privileged user being able to hijack a highly privileged service identity is ‘working as intended,’ what they are really saying is that your governance model is subordinate to their architecture,” he said. “It is a structural design flaw that hands out power to components most customers don’t even realize exist.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dont-wait-for-vendors-to-act"&gt;Don’t wait for vendors to act&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity consultant &lt;a href="https://formergov.com/directory/brianlevine"&gt;Brian Levine&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of FormerGov, was also concerned. “The smart move for CISOs is to build compensating controls now because waiting for vendors to redefine ‘intended behavior’ is not a security strategy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fvillanustre/"&gt;Flavio Villanustre&lt;/a&gt;, CISO for the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Group, warned, “A malicious insider could leverage these weaknesses to grant themselves more access than normally allowed.” But, he said, “There is little that can be done to mitigate the risk other than, possibly, limiting the blast radius by reducing the authentication scope and introducing robust security boundaries in between them.” However, “This could have the side effect of significantly increasing the cost, so it may not be a commercially viable option either.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gogia said the biggest risk is that these are holes that will likely go undetected because enterprise security tools are not programmed to look for them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most enterprises have no monitoring in place for service agent behavior. If one of these identities is abused, it won’t look like an attacker. It will look like the platform doing its job,” Gogia said. “That is what makes the risk severe. You are trusting components that you cannot observe, constrain, or isolate without fundamentally redesigning your cloud posture. Most organizations log user activity but ignore what the platform does internally. That needs to change. You need to monitor your service agents like they’re privileged employees. Build alerts around unexpected BigQuery queries, storage access, or session behavior. The attacker will look like the service agent, so that is where detection must focus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “Organizations are trusting code to run under identities they do not understand, performing actions they do not monitor, in environments they assume are safe. That is the textbook definition of invisible risk. And it is amplified in AI environments, because AI workloads often span multiple services, cross-reference sensitive datasets, and require orchestration that touches everything from logs to APIs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time Google’s Vertex AI has been found vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack: In November 2024, Palo Alto Networks issued a report finding similar issues with the Google Vertex AI environment, problems that &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/privilege-escalation-llm-model-exfil-vertex-ai/"&gt;Google told Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt; at the time that it had fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>AppGuard Critiques AI Hyped Defenses; Expands its Insider Release for its Next-Generation Platform</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4118270/appguard-critiques-ai-hyped-defenses-expands-its-insider-release-for-its-next-generation-platform.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.appguard.us/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GRC-Profile-of-AppGuard_2025-December.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Top 10 Cybersecurity Innovators profile&lt;/a&gt; by AppGuard has been released, spotlighting growing concerns over AI-enhanced malware. AI makes malware even more difficult to detect. Worse, they use AI to assess, adapt, and move faster than any cyber stack can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report advocates for a fundamental change in approach, highlighting the limitations of reactive security measures. Rather than constantly adding or changing detection layers of cyber stacks, the profile emphasizes the importance of reducing endpoint attack surface—a perspective that challenges conventional industry practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-detection-gap-crisis-why-magic-ai-fails"&gt;The Detection Gap Crisis: Why “Magic AI” Fails&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEO Fatih Comlekoglu&lt;/strong&gt; mentions that “You can’t keep trying to tell good from bad among infinite possibilities. Not even the most magical AI can parse infinity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry is trapped in a futile chase, piling on detection tools and adding AI enhancements that still fail to close the foundational gap. In fact, enterprises now face an overwhelming flood of alerts, with many organizations reportedly beginning to limit the amount of data they ingest simply because they can no longer keep up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-new-threat-lateral-movement-at-the-speed-of-ai"&gt;The New Threat: Lateral Movement at the Speed of AI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once remote control is established on an endpoint, adversarial AI reportedly adjusts the malicious process’s activities in real-time to evade detection and adapt to the environment. This dramatically shortens the time defenders have to respond and exacerbates flaws in detection-based security that depend on human approvals or interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="every-cyber-stack-needs-a-default-deny-layer"&gt;Every Cyber Stack Needs a “Default-Deny” Layer&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI cannot parse infinity; AI can only parse what it can, faster. Instead of joining the futile chase, “default-deny” or Zero Trust enforced within endpoints shrinks the attack surface. By restricting what can run and what the running can do, attacks run into walls, regardless of disguise or AI acceleration. The concept is akin to football: shrink the adversary’s “playing field” as well as its “playbook”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many controls-based layers can theoretically shrink the attack surface to some degree but few do so practically, thoroughly, and without considerable friction. AppGuard does this with 10 to 100 times fewer policy rules than alternatives. Even better, it uniquely auto-adapts to endpoint changes and malware technique variations. Fewer rules and fewer rules changes equate to easier operations and greater efficacy against malware, even AI-guided malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-is-not-detection-magic-but-it-is-helpful"&gt;AI is Not Detection Magic, But it is Helpful&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI is increasingly promoted as a breakthrough in cybersecurity, it remains a form of advanced pattern matching—subject to the same limitations as traditional detection methods. AppGuard affirms that it does not rely on AI for malware detection. Instead, the company sees AI enhancing its controls-based approach to endpoint protection. This includes improving attack surface management, minimizing disruption to legitimate workflows, and providing clearer visibility into policy enforcement and blocked events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="announcing-expanded-insider-release-for-veteran-operators"&gt;ANNOUNCING: Expanded Insider Release for Veteran Operators&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following recognition in the recent cybersecurity innovators profile, AppGuard has reopened its Insider Release program. The initiative seeks experienced endpoint security professionals—particularly those at MSSPs and MSPs managing multiple client environments—to provide hands-on feedback on AppGuard’s upcoming reengineered endpoint protection platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Selected participants will have early access to deploy the newly architected lightweight agent in combination with AppGuard’s new cloud-based management console.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seats are limited and reserved for qualified teams with proven operational experience. &lt;a href="https://www.appguard.us/appguard-enterprise-saas-insider-release/"&gt;Readers apply here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Selected participants receive: &lt;/strong&gt;early access to the new agent and cloud console and direct influence on final features and roadmap priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adding-appguard-anywhere-proven-effectiveness-and-pragmatism"&gt;Adding AppGuard Anywhere: Proven Effectiveness and Pragmatism &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding AppGuard to ANY cyber stack to stop what other layers miss entirely or detect too late: zero-days, ransomware, process injection, credential theft, info-stealers, living-off-the-land techniques. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AppGuard’s effectiveness is not theoretical. It has been proven repeatedly in the field for very large organizations to very small. For example, one of the world’s largest airlines, managing more than 40,000 endpoints, had been plagued by weekly malware incidents despite deploying multiple high-end cybersecurity solutions. After implementing AppGuard in 2019, the organization has experienced no successful malware breaches—a testament to the product’s real-world impact. Small businesses appreciate its easy deployment and the resulting end-user productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="about-appguard"&gt;About AppGuard&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.appguard.us/"&gt;AppGuard&lt;/a&gt; is the real-time, controls-based endpoint protection layer that stops what detection tools miss entirely or detect too late. It extends Zero Trust principles into the endpoint itself—down to the computing process—filling a critical gap where traditional Zero Trust models treat the endpoint as a black box. Adding it to any cyber stack delivers enterprise-grade protection with dramatically fewer rules, far less tuning, and far less operational overhead.

      <title>Southeast Asia CISOs Top 13 Predictions for 2026: Securing AI, Centering Identity, and Making Resilience Strategic</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4117844/southeast-asia-cisos-13-top-predictions-for-2026-securing-ai-centering-identity-and-making-resilience-strategic.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my recent conversation with CISOs across Southeast Asia, they shared with me a pragmatic view of 2026. Attackers are shifting tactics, AI is amplifying both risk and response, and IT-OT boundaries are blurring. Three priorities stand out to me, hardening cloud and AI infrastructure, treating identity as the active perimeter, and operationalizing resilience as capability and, in select sectors – as a service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud and AI become high‑value targets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multi‑cloud adoption and sprawling SaaS create visibility gaps where a single misconfiguration or leaked credential can expose sensitive data and expensive compute, including AI GPUs. CISOs mandate is to tighten configurations, expand telemetry, and assume adversaries are probing the weakest link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity and Trust Are the New Perimeter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We expect fewer “break‑ins” and more impersonation such as AI‑crafted lures, voice scams, session hijacks, and token theft that bypass traditional Multi-Factor Authentication. Southeast Asian CISOs are prioritizing continuous verification, session integrity controls, and trust checks embedded in workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain risk multiplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Open‑source components, model repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms widen exposure. A single compromised vendor can cascade across customers; ransomware and data theft increasingly arrive via “trusted” integrations. Organizations must strengthen vendor controls and harden pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentic AI raises the stakes on offense and defense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Autonomous agents can make poor decisions at machine speed unless constrained. Guardrails now include scoped, time‑bound access; human‑in‑the‑loop; kill‑switches; and behavioural monitoring. On defense, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are automating correlation, summarisation, containment, and remediation, elevating analysts to strategic hunting and validation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instrument the browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI works through browser sessions, responders need session reconstruction and richer telemetry to investigate fast‑moving incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People remain decision makers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With manipulation accelerating, boards are investing in targeted awareness, deception detection, and decision‑support training that complements technical controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT- OT convergence expands cyber‑physical risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industrial control systems require OT‑specific resilience such as segmentation, rigorous change control, and rehearsed recovery to be prioritized at the board level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In financial services, resilience becomes a revenue stream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large institutions may productize security assurance by packaging cyber resilience, AI‑enabled fraud controls, and compliance automation as subscription services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero Trust extends to non‑human identities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises will manage thousands of AI agents. Expect formal AI identity and access governance, including least privilege for agents, authentication models for non‑human actors, and continuous behavior monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="hacker stealing dollars bank cyber crime cybercrime money theft" class="wp-image-659116" src="https://legacy-us-images.foundryco.app/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/06/30/21/hacker-stealing-dollars-bank-cyber-crime-cybercrime-money-theft-100937830-orig-100942796-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSO ASEAN Final Take&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2026 will test whether organisations can secure what they automate. In my view, this collective Southeast Asia CISOs’ message is consistent: harden cloud and SaaS, elevate identity‑centric controls, instrument agents and browsers for forensic clarity, and treat resilience not only as defense but, where it makes sense, treat it as a product.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enjoy reading these top predictions for 2026 by our region’s most eminent CISOs who are also our CSO30 ASEAN &amp;amp; Hong Kong Award 2025 winners:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"&gt;&lt;div class="overflow-table-wrapper"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Lau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chief Information Security Officer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crypto.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Board Director at ISACA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2026, organizations will face attacks that increasingly blur the lines between cybercrime, insider threat, and nation-state activity. Social engineering, SaaS compromise, digital-asset theft, and extortion will no longer appear as isolated incidents, but as coordinated services designed to scale impact and pressure defenders simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2026 we will likely see widely reported incidents of agentic AI going rogue. Not necessarily through rebellion, but through unchecked autonomy combined with speed. Boards will be forced to confront accountability when agents make bad decisions at machine scale, and organizations will need to redesign Model Context Protocol usage around human‑in‑the‑loop controls, scoped and time‑bound access, real‑time kill switches, and continuous behavioral monitoring. Governance that can’t keep up with velocity will be bypassed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2026, the defining risk will be business‑process and human-layer exfiltration where AI systems, SaaS integrations and wearables become the transport layer for data loss. Security teams will be forced to rethink data‑loss prevention for an AI‑human-augmented world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incident response and SOC teams will need to think about adding new telemetry for analysis- Agentic browser session reconstruction. Organizations that treat “AI browser access” like a normal productivity feature, rather than privileged access, will learn the risks the hard way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yohannes Glen Dwipajana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;SVP Head of Enterprise Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloud misconfigurations, SaaS integrations, and AI GPU resources are under a constant attack. Most of the company will have a multi-cloud strategy environment however it will reduce SOC real time visibility to detect lateral movement, and the Threat Actor will steal your data and also compute power. This can be happened by a single misconfigured credential then will expose the enterprise.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Threat Actor are shifting away from breaking systems, they are impersonating people, sessions, and trusted workflows using AI-generated phishing, voice scams, and deepfakes are indistinguishable from real communications, there will be more session hijacking and token theft to bypass traditional MFA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supply chain is the multiplier of risk, by having many software suppliers, using open-source components, AI models, and cloud platforms are now prime entry points. One single compromised vendor may expose thousands of customers. By exploiting vendor’s AI model repositories and CI/CD pipelines become a new emerging attack vector. Ransomware attack may increasingly enter through our “trusted” partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Saw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chief Information Security Officer, APAC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siemens Energy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 8 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As agentic AI accelerates attack speeds, human intuition will prove increasingly unreliable against sophisticated manipulation. This will drive boards to treat employee resilience as a core risk factor and invest in employees’ cybersecurity awareness programs and training, as well as proactive deception detection alongside technical controls.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction &lt;/strong&gt;9&lt;br /&gt;As Information Technology/Operational Technology (IT/OT) integration accelerates operational efficiency, cyber-physical attacks targeting industrial control systems (ICS) will rise, prompting boards to prioritize OT resilience as a core business risk alongside traditional IT security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primitivo Nufable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;VP &amp;amp; Head – IT, Information &amp;amp; Cyber Security Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;St Luke’s Medical Centre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 9&lt;/strong&gt;                            &lt;br /&gt;Security teams will respond by fully operationalizing AI within their SOCs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2026, healthcare sector and St Luke’s Medical Centre in particular, will be laying Agentic AI SOCs roadmap to upgrade our existing SOC running on the basic SIEM/SOAR platform. AI agents will assist analysts by handling data correlation, incident summaries, and automated containment and remediation, allowing human analysts to focus on strategic threat hunting and validation. St Luke’s Medical Centre will try to replace L1 &amp;amp; L2 Cybersecurity Analyst with Agentic AI Analyst and L3 Cybersecurity Analyst will be in-charge of the governance of these AI agents. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chhay Yaroth &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;SVP and Head of Information Security Division&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACLEDA Bank Plc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 60% of the world’s top 50 financial institutions by revenue will have launched profitable cyber-resilience products by 2026. This will give rise to a new metric-Security Contribution Margin which is tracked by analysts. Moreover, one-third of large fintech will become customers of their banking partners’ security services, flipping the traditional client-provider relationship based on cyber maturity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major company will suffer material data risks originating from an over-permissioned, compromised, or hallucinating autonomous AI agent, leading to a new regulatory focus on “AI Identity and Access Governance” and forcing 60% of CISOs to create a dedicated “AI Identity” team within IAM.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>7 top cybersecurity projects for 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116992/7-top-cybersecurity-projects-for-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As 2026 finds CISOs’ battle against relentless cyberattackers escalating once again, strong and carefully planned cybersecurity projects are the best way to stay a step ahead of attackers and prevent them from gaining the upper hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From data governance to zero trust, here are several essential cybersecurity projects every CISO should consider adopting in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-transforming-identity-access-for-the-ai-era"&gt;1. Transforming identity access for the AI era&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI and automation evolve, managing not only employee access &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109999/agentic-ai-already-hinting-at-cybersecuritys-pending-identity-crisis.html"&gt;but also the identities of AI agents&lt;/a&gt; and machine processes is now a cybersecurity essential, says &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/people/profiles.anthony-berg+85d3b4d5.html"&gt;Anthony Berg&lt;/a&gt;, Deloitte’s US cyber identity leader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The rapid evolution of AI, especially agentic AI, has prompted many security leaders to rethink identity management strategies,” he says. “The need for better identity governance, spanning both people and non-human identities, has inspired CISOs and CIOs to reimagine their security frameworks for the next wave of digital transformation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for organizations to proactively modernize their IAM programs, especially as gen AI and agentic AI enable new business models and levels of autonomy,” Berg says. “Securing access across every digital identity is essential to safeguarding sensitive data, supporting compliance requirements, and driving operational efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By advancing &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/518296/what-is-iam-identity-and-access-management-explained.html"&gt;identity and access management (IAM)&lt;/a&gt; capabilities, such as lifecycle management, strong authentication, and precise role- and policy-based access controls, enterprises can prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risks posed by compromised credentials, Berg says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Extending these controls to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2132294/what-are-non-human-identities-and-why-do-they-matter.html"&gt;non-human identities&lt;/a&gt; will help ensure that every entity interacting with systems or data is governed appropriately,” he says, adding that regular access reviews and ongoing education will also help safeguard information and enable secure adoption of advanced AI technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-strengthening-email-security"&gt;2. Strengthening email security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phishing continues to be a primary attack vector for stealing credentials and defrauding victims, says Mary Ann Blair, CISO at Carnegie Mellon University. She warns that threat actors are now &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3850783/11-ways-cybercriminals-are-making-phishing-more-potent-than-ever.html"&gt;generating increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks&lt;/a&gt;, effectively evading mail providers’ detection capabilities. “Legacy multifactor authentication techniques are now regularly defeated, and threat actors are moving quickly to monetize their foothold.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Facing an increasingly challenging email environment, Blair says CISOs should consider &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4040161/7-signs-its-time-for-a-managed-security-service-provider.html"&gt;turning to external sources&lt;/a&gt; for added security project assistance. She notes that several vendors she’s contacted have responded with an RFP and are enabling a test-drive of their latest capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-leveraging-ai-to-discover-code-vulnerabilities"&gt;3. Leveraging AI to discover code vulnerabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-priyanshu/"&gt;Aman Priyanshu&lt;/a&gt;, a Cisco AI researcher, is developing autonomous vulnerability search agents using small language models (SLMs) that can run effectively in resource-constrained environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is inherently a long-context domain, and while current state-of-the-art LLMs can handle it, they do so at a significant tradeoff for cost or latency, Priyanshu says. “For example, organizational codebases are massive, often spanning thousands of files and millions of lines of code,” he states. “When you need to find a specific vulnerability, you face either an impossibly expensive context window if you load everything into a large model, or you’re simply out of the context limit entirely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Priyanshu says his project aims to create SLM agents that resolve threats in the same way most human analysts do — through iterative investigation by reasoning about where vulnerabilities might be, searching those areas, retrieving relevant code, and repeating the process until the weaknesses can be found. “While we’ve demonstrated that this approach works in our research, we’re hoping to scale things up and practically explore real-world deployment in 2026.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Penetration testers and security researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3632268/gen-ai-is-transforming-the-cyber-threat-landscape-by-democratizing-vulnerability-hunting.html"&gt;deploying generative AI for vulnerability hunting&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, with AI-powered bug hunting now showing signs of accelerating and democratizing vulnerability discovery — and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082265/ai-powered-bug-hunting-shakes-up-bounty-industry-for-better-or-worse.html"&gt;altering the calculus of what makes for an effective bounty program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-reenforcing-enterprise-ai-governance-and-data-protection"&gt;4. Reenforcing enterprise AI governance and data protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI risks and autonomous threats reshape the cybersecurity landscape, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/atorok/?originalSubdomain=hu"&gt;Attila Török&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at GoTo, an AI-based cloud communications provider, is working to ensure that his organization can securely manage and monitor all AI tools while blocking unsanctioned platforms, preventing data leakage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By embedding secure-by-design principles and aligning cybersecurity with business strategy, we’re building resilience, trust, and compliance — all of which are key differentiators in the AI era,” he says. However, as with any major security initiative, success can’t happen within a silo, he warns. “It will take collaboration with every department across our business to establish practices that ensure success now and in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-prioritizing-ai-to-enhance-security-operations"&gt;5. Prioritizing AI to enhance security operations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sales performance management firm Xactly is prioritizing AI trust because the math dictates it and the threat landscape demands it, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciso-mba/"&gt;Matthew Sharp&lt;/a&gt;, CISO there. “We conducted a rigorous Christensen-style analysis of our security operations and found that roughly 67% of functional work — tasks such as evidence gathering, alert validation, and compliance reporting — is mechanical and can be automated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adversaries are already using AI to attack at machine speed, Sharp warns, noting that organizations can’t defend against AI-driven attacks with human-speed responses. “Operationalizing AI trust allows us to fight fire with fire, since we can’t afford to have human analysts performing tasks that machines can do more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI continues to emerge as a viable tool for defense, CISOs are also &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042494/how-ai-is-reshaping-cybersecurity-operations.html"&gt;rethinking how their teams operate&lt;/a&gt; to harness the technology’s potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-moving-to-a-zero-trust-by-default-model"&gt;6. Moving to a zero-trust-by-default model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavlo-tkhir/"&gt;Pavlo Tkhir&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Euristiq, says his main project for 2026 is the implementation of zero trust architecture for all the software development firm’s internal and client development. “We’ve long worked with companies for whom security is critical, but in 2026, market and regulatory demands will be so high that moving to a complete ‘zero-trust-by-default’ model will become a strategic imperative.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Tkhir, the project isn’t just about strengthening the company’s own security. “It will also allow us to build even more secure platforms for our clients, from high-load enterprise systems to AI-powered solutions where data integrity is critical,” he says. “We’re implementing zero-trust across infrastructure, development, CI/CD, and internal tools — this creates a unified security standard that will then be transferred to client architectures.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initiative wasn’t born out of a specific incident, but from close observation, Tkhir says. “We saw that threat models are changing faster than ever.” He notes that attacks are increasingly occurring not on the perimeter, but internally: through library vulnerabilities, APIs, weak authentication mechanisms, or erroneous permissions. “This is what inspired us to completely rethink our approach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-bolstering-data-governance-across-the-enterprise"&gt;7. Bolstering data governance across the enterprise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building a unified data governance and security framework across all enterprise systems is a 2026 priority for &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrykunstprofile/"&gt;Barry Kunst&lt;/a&gt;, a director at Solix Technologies, an enterprise data, AI, and data fabric solutions provider. The initiative is being undertaken in part to address the kinds of shadow data, inconsistent access control, and compliance gaps most organizations still struggle, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you standardize how data is classified, protected, and monitored across every environment, you close the biggest security loophole — untracked sensitive data,” Kunst says. “This project will strengthen our security by improving visibility, enforcing policy-driven controls, and reducing exposure in multi-cloud setups.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kunst says his organization launched the initiative after seeing its customers overwhelmed by rapid data growth and new regulatory requirements. “Our security and cloud engineering teams are collaborating with key technology partners, with a planned rollout in 2026’s third quarter,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
