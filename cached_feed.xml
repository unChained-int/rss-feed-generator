      <title>Roughly half of employees are using unsanctioned AI tools, and enterprise leaders are major culprits</title>

      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shadow AI, the secret, unapproved use of AI by employees, isn’t going away. In fact, workers are getting more brazen, and their employers often don’t seem to care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new BlackFog survey, nearly half (49%) of workers admit to adopting &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086912/how-shadow-it-leaves-every-industry-in-the-dark.html" target="_blank"&gt;AI tools without employer approval&lt;/a&gt;, many using free versions with which they are freely sharing sensitive enterprise data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more alarmingly, a wide majority — 69% of presidents and C-suite members and 66% of directors and senior VPs — seem to be OK with this, prioritizing speed over privacy as they race to adopt AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The efficiency gains and personnel cost savings are too large to ignore, and override any security concerns,” said &lt;a href="https://www.blackfog.com/dr-darren-williams-founder-ceo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Darren Williams&lt;/a&gt;, BlackFog founder and CEO. The research is a “stark indication” of the wide use of unapproved AI tools in the enterprise, and also the “level of risk tolerance amongst employees and senior leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="shadow-ai-by-the-numbers"&gt;Shadow AI by the numbers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.blackfog.com/blackfog-research-shadow-ai-threat-grows/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of 2,000 workers at companies with more than 500 employees found that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4044007/shadow-ai-is-surging-getting-ai-adoption-right-is-your-best-defense.html" target="_blank"&gt;shadow AI&lt;/a&gt; is rampant, and not much is being done to rein it in. Of those surveyed, 86% said they use AI on a weekly basis at work, the most common use cases being in technical support, sales (such as email marketing), and contracts. But more than one-third of them admitted to using the free versions of company-approved tools, raising questions about where sensitive corporate data is being stored and processed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;51% have connected AI tools to work systems or apps without the approval or knowledge of IT;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;63% believe it’s acceptable to use AI when there is no corporate-approved option or IT oversight;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;60% say speed is worth the security risk;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;21% think employers will simply “turn a blind eye” as long as they’re getting their work done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the C-suite’s own use of shadow tools? That’s a little more difficult to gauge; they’re close-lipped about it, indicating a wider problem, Williams noted. “Senior executives often don’t want to admit they are using AI,” he said. Instead, they’re trying to prove how valuable they are without disclosing their own AI use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just like workers elsewhere in the enterprise, “senior leaders are able to get more done faster than ever” with AI, he noted. For instance, he said, “you can draft a legal contract in seconds and get a lawyer to review, rather than spend weeks drafting and redrafting using external counsel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concerningly, when it comes to the tools workers are using, free versions tend to be the most popular. More than half (58%) of employees using non-approved tools rely on free versions, and 34% of those working at companies that do allow AI tools are also opting for the free version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Non-paid is almost certainly worse because of the licensing and business models around them,” said Williams. “There is always a cost to using free tools; in this case it’s the value of your data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And employees are not shy about loading sensitive data into &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4117010/4-issues-holding-back-cisos-security-agendas.html" target="_blank"&gt;unsanctioned AI tools&lt;/a&gt;: 33% admit to sharing enterprise research or datasets; 27% to revealing employee data (such as salary or performance tracking); 23% to inputting company financial information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This becomes dangerous because virtually all free tools use ingested data to train their models, and some of the lower-tiered paid tools do, too, Williams pointed out. “And,” he said, “you cannot get this information back.” Paid enterprise plans typically allow companies to turn off training on their data, but not always. Admins must check this with their large language model (LLM) providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The big problem is the loss of intellectual property,” said Williams. And threat actors can get access to this information to profile and target an organization, breach their networks, and exfiltrate confidential data for extortion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The more data that is disclosed to LLMs, the more information is available [to threat actors] to build a better profile,” Williams noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprises-must-build-policies-around-ai-use"&gt;Enterprises must build policies around AI use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many CEOs have been mandating AI adoption and are allocating capital throughout the business for this purpose, Williams noted. Executives are looking for cost savings as a strategic advantage and a way to quickly return shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, security is an afterthought, he said. “Many companies have just chosen to ignore the problem, and have decided not to create a policy or see the value in paying for the technology, which is a very big mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations are “flying blind,” and 99% have no way of even knowing what is happening in their environments because there are no products in place to measure it, he observed. This should raise serious red flags for security teams, and there must be greater oversight and visibility into these security blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Williams advised enterprises to audit what is going on inside their systems, measure the scope of the problem, define policies around AI use, and adopt governance frameworks to control it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, employees must be made aware of the risks. Many, CISOs included, don’t actually understand the extent of the problem and its broader implications. “Education is essential and doesn’t require a lot of work,” said Williams. On the other hand, implementing a policy and framework does, and enterprises first need to decide what risks they are willing to live with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he said, we are navigating an unprecedented time in history, with new technology advancing at such a rapid pace that the technologists themselves don’t even know where it is going. Enterprises must quickly understand the implications, and use AI responsibly to gain a strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just as the industrial revolution and the internet changed the way we worked, AI is doing the same,” said Williams. “In fact, we expect this to be an even bigger shift than either of those transitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human risk management: CISOs’ solution to the security awareness training paradox</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123230/human-risk-management-cisos-solution-to-the-security-awareness-training-paradox.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity guru Bruce Scheier is often quoted as saying, “People are the weakest link in the security chain.” No more accurate words have ever been spoken about cybersecurity. You can spend millions of dollars on firewalls, endpoint security tools, access controls, and data encryption, but one employee can cause a catastrophic security breach, simply by downloading a malicious file or clicking on a rogue link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry research indicates that 70% to 90% of breaches are the result of employees succumbing to social engineering, making skills-based errors, sharing sensitive data with shadow IT services, or through a compromise of a privileged user. Oh, and things seem to be getting worse as adversaries &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt;adopt sophisticated AI-based attacks like deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, this problem is well known. As a countermeasure, organizations spent around $6 billion on &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;security awareness training (SAT)&lt;/a&gt; in 2025. While some firms did so as a best practice, most did so to comply with industry or government regulations such as HIPAA (requires a “security awareness and training program” for all workforce members per 45 CFR § 164.308), GDPR (article 39(1)(b) tasks data protection officers with “awareness-raising and training of staff”), PCI (requirement 12.6 mandates a formal program to make all personnel aware of cardholder data security), and many others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry research indicates that SAT expenses will increase by an estimated 15% per year as organizations continue to invest in what Gartner calls “security behavior and culture programs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-security-awareness-training-paradox"&gt;The security awareness training paradox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While security awareness training has become a CISO and HR staple, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1246117/8-reasons-your-cybersecurity-training-program-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it.html"&gt;it continues to have questionable efficacy&lt;/a&gt;. Some organizations treat SAT as a checkbox exercise for regulatory compliance, with little regard to its value. Employees exacerbate this folly through “compliance theater,” clicking through tutorials as fast as possible &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567841/5-reasons-users-hate-cybersecurity-awareness-training-and-how-to-make-them-love-it.html"&gt;to get them out of their way&lt;/a&gt;. Even studious employees can suffer from the “forgetting curve,” a psychological model that illustrates how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some cases, SAT can even be counterproductive. In some studies, employees who receive high grades with security awareness training become overly confident and complacent with their security behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, there’s a disillusioning situation here I call the security awareness training paradox. Despite regulatory compliance requirements and significant investment, SAT seems to deliver marginal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, SAT is broken — even with peripheral improvements like synthetic phishing tools. So, what’s needed? Over the next few years, organizations should shift from static/sporadic security training to an emerging discipline called human risk management (HRM).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-human-risk-management"&gt;What is human risk management?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HRM is defined as a cybersecurity strategy that identifies, measures, and reduces the risks caused by human behavior. Simply stated, security awareness training is about what employees know; HRM is about what they do (i.e., their actual cybersecurity behavior).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be more specific, HRM integrates into email security tools, web gateways, and identity and access management (IAM) systems to identify human vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it measures risk using behavioral data and pinpoints an organization’s riskiest users. HRM then seeks to mitigate these risks by applying targeted interventions such as micro-learning, simulations, or automated security controls. Finally, HRM monitors behavioral changes so organizations can track progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a misconception out there that HRM and SAT are different animals, so organizations interested in HRM must budget for both. Wrong. In fact, leading HRM solutions from vendors such as Fable Security, KnowBe4, and Mimecast offer HRM products chock full of standard SAT material. They even provide specific training support for regulatory compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="democratizing-security-training-with-ai"&gt;Democratizing security training with AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking. HRM sounds like the latest buzz term coined by the cybersecurity industry marketing glitterati. Yeah, kind of true, but generic HRM has an AI-based partner riding shotgun. And unlike general industry AI hype, there’s research and expert agreement that AI is well positioned to change education as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI, &lt;/em&gt;University of Pennsylvania professor Ethan Mollick suggests that AI will deliver personalized learning at scale where AI acts as a “Socratic tutor” that “nudges” students toward excellence, provides simulations and role plays, and offers persona-based learning. In an HRM context, a “nudge” can be thought of as continuous micro-learning. A user clicks on a malicious link and is guided toward an appropriate security lesson aimed at reinforcing good hygiene and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armed with AI, HRM will also understand habits and ways of learning. For example, Alice tends to learn best through written descriptions while Bob prefers watching videos. Leading HRM tools can also role play with users, gamifying cybersecurity training and playing on their competitive nature. Thus, HRM (with AI) has the potential to democratize expertise in a new and unique way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From an ROI perspective, HRM offers a much more granular approach to cyber-risk mitigation than standard SAT. CISOs and HR managers can report on improved cyber hygiene and behavior, rather than how many employees have been trained and past generic tests. Repeat offenders are not only identified but also provided with personalized training tools and attention. Ultimately, HRM makes it possible to show a direct correlation between training and a reduction in actual security incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To quote Aristotle, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” HRM is intended to personalize training to change behavior and habits. If Aristotle were a CISO, he’d surely see the logic in moving from generic SAT to HRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing like &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/539824/data-protection-security-conferences-why-go.html"&gt;attending a face-to-face event&lt;/a&gt; for career networking and knowledge gathering, and we don’t have to tell you how helpful it can be to get a hands-on demo of a new tool or to have your questions answered by experts. Fortunately, plenty of great conferences are coming up in the months ahead. If keeping abreast of security trends and evolving threats is critical to your job — and we know it is — then attending some top-notch security conferences is on your must-do list for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From major events to those that are more narrowly focused, this list from the editors of CSO, will help you find the security conferences that matter the most to you. We’ll keep it updated with new conferences so check back often. While we don’t expect this calendar to be comprehensive, we do aim to have it be highly relevant. If there’s something we’ve missed, let us know. You can email your additions, corrections and updates to &lt;a href="mailto:samira_sarraf@foundryco.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samira Sarraf&lt;/a&gt;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-illusion-der-eigenen-sicherheitszone"&gt;Die Illusion der eigenen Sicherheitszone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viele Unternehmen investieren heute erhebliche Mittel, um ihre interne IT abzusichern. Firewalls, Monitoring, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3842982/6-wichtige-punkte-fur-ihren-incident-response-plan.html" target="_blank"&gt;Incident-Response-Pläne&lt;/a&gt; und Awareness-Programme sind etabliert. Gleichzeitig wächst eine gefährliche Illusion: Die Annahme, dass sich Risiken innerhalb der eigenen Systemgrenzen kontrollieren lassen. Die Realität sieht anders aus. Moderne Geschäftsmodelle sind ohne externe IT-Dienstleister, Cloud-Services, Softwarelieferanten und spezialisierte Subunternehmen kaum noch denkbar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genau hier entstehen die größten Unsicherheiten. NIS2 greift diese Entwicklung auf und stellt klar, dass Cybersicherheit nicht an der eigenen Firewall endet. Die Richtlinie zwingt Unternehmen, ihre Lieferketten nicht nur technisch, sondern strategisch neu zu bewerten. Sie macht externe Abhängigkeiten zu einem integralen Bestandteil der Sicherheitsarchitektur und damit zu einer Führungsaufgabe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nis2-verschiebt-den-fokus-von-systemen-auf-abhangigkeiten"&gt;NIS2 verschiebt den Fokus von Systemen auf Abhängigkeiten&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Kern verfolgt NIS2 einen klaren Ansatz. Risiken sollen dort adressiert werden, wo sie tatsächlich entstehen. Statistiken und Incident-Analysen zeigen seit Jahren, dass Angriffe zunehmend über Drittparteien erfolgen. Software-Updates, Wartungszugänge oder ausgelagerte Services dienen als Einfallstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 reagiert darauf, indem sie Lieferketten explizit in den Geltungsbereich aufnimmt. Unternehmen sind verpflichtet, Risiken in Bezug auf ihre direkten Dienstleister und auch auf nachgelagerte Subunternehmen zu bewerten. Entscheidend ist nicht mehr, ob ein Vorfall intern oder extern ausgelöst wird, sondern welche Auswirkungen er auf kritische Dienste hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Damit verabschiedet sich die Regulierung von einem rein technischen Sicherheitsverständnis. Sie fordert ein strukturiertes Management von Abhängigkeiten, das Risiken sichtbar macht und steuerbar hält.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesetipp: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4103179/nis2-umsetzen-ohne-im-papierkrieg-zu-enden.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS2 umsetzen – ohne im Papierkrieg zu enden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="warum-lieferketten-besonders-anfallig-sind"&gt;Warum Lieferketten besonders anfällig sind&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115440/shai-hulud-co-die-supply-chain-als-achillesferse.html" target="_blank"&gt;Supply Chain&lt;/a&gt; ist aus mehreren Gründen ein attraktives Ziel für Angreifer. Externe Partner verfügen häufig über privilegierte Zugänge, arbeiten mit sensiblen Daten oder sind tief in operative Prozesse eingebunden. Gleichzeitig unterliegen sie oft nicht denselben Sicherheitsstandards wie große Organisationen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hinzu kommt eine strukturelle Intransparenz. Unternehmen wissen oft nicht, welche weiteren Dienstleister ihre Partner einsetzen oder wie Zugriffe technisch umgesetzt sind. Diese fehlende Sichtbarkeit führt zu einer fragmentierten Sicherheitslage, in der Risiken zwar bekannt sind, aber nicht quantifizierbar bleiben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 setzt genau hier an und verlangt nachvollziehbare Prozesse zur Identifikation, Bewertung und Überwachung dieser Risiken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="der-bruch-mit-traditioneller-compliance"&gt;Der Bruch mit traditioneller Compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Viele Organisationen sind es gewohnt, regulatorische Anforderungen formal zu erfüllen. Fragebögen werden verschickt, Zertifikate abgelegt, Checklisten abgehakt. Dieses Vorgehen erzeugt Dokumentation, aber keine Sicherheit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 macht deutlich, dass formale &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494023/cybersicherheitsvorschriften-so-erfullen-sie-ihre-compliance-anforderungen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Compliance&lt;/a&gt; nicht ausreicht. Die Richtlinie verlangt eine wirksame Umsetzung von Sicherheitsmaßnahmen und eine nachweisbare Kontrolle ihrer Wirksamkeit. Das betrifft auch und insbesondere externe Partner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Sicherheitskonzept, das sich ausschließlich auf Selbstauskünfte stützt, wird den Anforderungen nicht mehr gerecht. Gefordert ist ein realistisches Bild der tatsächlichen Sicherheitsreife entlang der Lieferkette.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-nis2-konkret-von-unternehmen-erwartet"&gt;Was NIS2 konkret von Unternehmen erwartet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 formuliert keine technischen Detailvorgaben, sondern definiert klare Zielsetzungen. Unternehmen müssen Risiken identifizieren, priorisieren und angemessen behandeln. Für Lieferketten bedeutet das mehrere zentrale Aufgaben:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Erstens müssen Abhängigkeiten systematisch erfasst werden. Welche Dienstleister sind für den Betrieb essenziell? Welche Daten verarbeiten sie? Welche Zugriffsrechte bestehen?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zweitens sind angemessene Sicherheitsanforderungen zu definieren. Diese müssen zum Risiko passen und vertraglich verankert sein.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Drittens verlangt NIS2 eine kontinuierliche Überwachung. Risiken verändern sich. Geschäftsmodelle, Bedrohungslagen und technische Architekturen entwickeln sich weiter. Sicherheitsbewertungen dürfen daher kein einmaliges Projekt bleiben.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-rolle-des-ciso-unter-nis2"&gt;Die Rolle des CISO unter NIS2&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für CISOs bedeutet NIS2 eine deutliche Erweiterung ihres Verantwortungsbereichs. Technische Exzellenz allein reicht nicht mehr aus. Gefragt sind Kommunikationsfähigkeit, Risikobewertung und die Fähigkeit, Sicherheitsanforderungen organisationsübergreifend durchzusetzen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495028/chief-information-security-officer-ein-neues-berufsbild-fur-cisos.html" target="_blank"&gt;CISO&lt;/a&gt; wird zum Vermittler zwischen Technik, Management, Einkauf und Recht. Er muss erklären, warum bestimmte Anforderungen notwendig sind, welche Risiken bestehen und welche Konsequenzen Untätigkeit haben kann. NIS2 stärkt diese Rolle, indem sie klare Verantwortlichkeiten definiert und die Bedeutung von Cybersicherheit auf Vorstandsebene verankert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="warum-viele-lieferkettenbewertungen-schief-gehen"&gt;Warum viele Lieferkettenbewertungen schief gehen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In der Praxis scheitern Lieferkettenbewertungen häufig an folgenden drei Punkten:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fehlende Priorisierung:&lt;/strong&gt; Unternehmen versuchen, alle Partner gleich zu behandeln und verlieren dabei den Fokus auf die wirklich kritischen Abhängigkeiten.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mangelnde Durchsetzbarkeit:&lt;/strong&gt; Sicherheitsanforderungen werden formuliert, aber nicht überprüft oder bei Abweichungen konsequent eingefordert.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organisatorische Silos:&lt;/strong&gt; Einkauf, IT und Recht agieren getrennt voneinander. Sicherheitsrisiken werden dadurch fragmentiert betrachtet und nicht ganzheitlich gesteuert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 macht deutlich, dass diese Ansätze nicht mehr ausreichen. Gefordert ist ein integriertes Risikomanagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kontrollmechanismen-mit-substanz"&gt;Kontrollmechanismen mit Substanz&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wirksame Kontrolle bedeutet nicht maximale Bürokratie. Entscheidend ist die Qualität der Maßnahmen. Für kritische Partner können das regelmäßige technische Assessments, strukturierte Audits oder klar definierte Eskalationsprozesse sein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wichtig ist, dass Unternehmen die Fähigkeit behalten, Risiken eigenständig zu bewerten und nicht vollständig an Dritte auszulagern. NIS2 verlangt Verantwortungsübernahme, keine Delegation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kontrollmechanismen müssen zudem skalierbar sein. Nicht jeder Partner erfordert denselben Aufwand. Entscheidend ist die potenzielle Auswirkung eines Sicherheitsvorfalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lieferketten-als-strategischer-resilienzfaktor"&gt;Lieferketten als strategischer Resilienzfaktor&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen, die NIS2 als reine Compliance-Aufgabe betrachten, verschenken Potenzial. Eine realistische Bewertung von Lieferketten stärkt nicht nur die regulatorische Position, sondern erhöht die operative Stabilität. Transparente Abhängigkeiten, klare Sicherheitsanforderungen und funktionierende Kontrollprozesse reduzieren Ausfallrisiken und verbessern die Reaktionsfähigkeit im Ernstfall. Lieferketten werden damit vom Schwachpunkt zur strategischen Ressource.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fazit-nis2-zwingt-zur-ehrlichkeit"&gt;Fazit: NIS2 zwingt zur Ehrlichkeit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 konfrontiert Unternehmen mit einer unbequemen Wahrheit. Cybersicherheit endet nicht an der eigenen Systemgrenze. Wer kritische Prozesse auslagert, bleibt dennoch verantwortlich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Richtlinie fordert einen ehrlichen Blick auf Abhängigkeiten, Risiken und eigene Steuerungsfähigkeit. Für CISOs ist das eine Herausforderung, aber auch eine Chance. Lieferketten sind unter NIS2 keine Randnotiz mehr. Sie sind der Prüfstein für wirksame Cybersicherheit und nachhaltige Resilienz. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Startup Amutable plotting Linux security overhaul to counter hacking threats</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4125145/startup-amutable-plotting-linux-security-overhaul-to-counter-hacking-threats.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing guaranteed to grab attention in the computer security world, it’s announcing yourself without fully explaining what it is you plan to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, the Linux world got a taste of this enigmatic marketing ploy with the launch out of stealth of Berlin-based Linux security outfit Amutable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While its purpose is only vaguely defined in &lt;a href="https://amutable.com/blog/introducing-amutable" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the launch announcement&lt;/a&gt;, nobody could accuse it of lacking ambition: it plans to bring “determinism and verifiable integrity to Linux systems” to address the operating system’s security weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most tiny companies nobody has heard of would struggle to make the tactic work, but Amutable’s roster of founders is made up of several well-known Linux figures, headed by former Red Hat and Microsoft engineer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lennart Poettering&lt;/a&gt; as chief engineer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Best known as the developer of the contentious but widely used Linux UEFI boot manager &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"&gt;systemd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, he has alongside him two other ex-Microsoft employees, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherk1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Kühl&lt;/a&gt; as CEO, and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-brauner/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Brauner&lt;/a&gt; as CTO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A clue to Amutable’s plans lies in the announcement’s emphasis on some of its founders’ backgrounds in Kubernetes, &lt;em&gt;runc&lt;/em&gt;, LXC, Incus, and &lt;em&gt;containerd&lt;/em&gt;, all connected in different ways to the Linux container stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="verifiable-integrity"&gt;Verifiable integrity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Computing is full of security problems, and Linux is no exception to this rule, given convincing the protective free and open source software community of the wisdom of a radical new idea often turns out to be as big a challenge as the engineering itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Linux distros on desktop computers remain a niche, the technology’s invisible domination of online platforms and cloud container orchestration tools makes it the most important operating system in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That, not surprisingly, has made it a target for attacks, with cybercriminals taking advantage of vulnerabilities allowing privilege escalation, container escapes, and other exploits, as well as embedding backdoors in open source images across Linux’s complex supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Judging from Amutable’s self-declared vision to bring “determinism and verifiable integrity to Linux system,” the founders see plenty of room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Today’s infrastructure approaches security reactively. Software agents watch for vulnerabilities and intrusions; attackers refine their evasion. These defensive approaches are costly, brittle, and ineffective,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Amutable’s mission is to deliver verifiable integrity to Linux workloads everywhere. We look forward to working towards this goal with the broader Linux community.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-cocktail-of-problems"&gt;A cocktail of problems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue presents a rich cocktail of problems, the underlying causes of which are the difficulty of verifying that an image is as its developers intended and hasn’t been tampered with, while also maintaining a verifiable system state. Even existing security tools are struggling to keep up, with a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3971170/proof-of-concept-bypass-shows-weakness-in-linux-security-tools-claims-israeli-vendor.html" target="_blank"&gt;2025 proof-of-concept&lt;/a&gt; showing that it was possible to bypass leading Linux runtime security tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps what Amutable’s founders mean when they describe the need to “replace heuristics with rigor” to achieve “verifiable integrity.” An image should be cryptographically verifiable in advance, including, ideally, a hash record of every stage of the boot process as well as running continuous checks against a signed file manifest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, instead of looking for a rogue file or suspicious behavior after the fact, the system would be able to verify itself deterministically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Introduction of this model of verifiability into Linux might have mitigated a range of incidents, including a 2023 attack where attackers &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4087323/runtime-bugs-break-container-walls-enabling-root-on-docker-hosts.html" target="_blank"&gt;exploited CVE-2022-42475&lt;/a&gt; in Fortinet’s FortiOS SSL-VPN function to implant malware. Or a more &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4087323/runtime-bugs-break-container-walls-enabling-root-on-docker-hosts.html" target="_blank"&gt;recent vulnerability (CVE-2025-31133)&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;runc&lt;/em&gt; Kubernetes container runtime that allowed attackers to break out of containers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the issue’s biggest impact was from the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2077692/dangerous-xz-utils-backdoor-was-the-result-of-years-long-supply-chain-compromise-effort.html" target="_blank"&gt;backdoor supply chain hack&lt;/a&gt; affecting the XZ Utils data compression library that was uncovered by chance in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-common-goal"&gt;A common goal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security of the IT infrastructure is one of the top concerns for decades, and immutability, verification and full coverage of software supply chain throughout the lifecycle of an operating system or complete infrastructure are important contributions to achieve this,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mge1512/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Matthias G. Eckermann&lt;/a&gt;, director of product management, Linux at SUSE. He pointed out that SUSE is already delivering on this in multiple ways, including its certified Software Supply Chain and its Immutable OS with Transactional Updates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are looking forward to hearing more from Amutable and collaborating with them on the common goal of improving resiliency and security of open-source infrastructure software,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technology-not-the-only-problem"&gt;Technology not the only problem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, where this goes and how Amutable will make money is up in the air, but it will attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security teams are trained to trust signed packages and verified sources. When the supply chain itself is compromised (like the XZ Utils backdoor in 2024), traditional security training doesn’t prepare defenders for that scenario,” commented &lt;a href="https://trainingcamp.com/author-cporter/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Porter&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of certification company Training Camp. “If they [Amutable] can simplify verification, it reduces the expertise burden on security teams who currently lack deep Linux platform knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, technology isn’t the only problem. “As Linux dominates cloud infrastructure, enterprises need security professionals who understand boot integrity, code signing, and verification, skills that aren’t covered in most certification programs,” said Porter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>
