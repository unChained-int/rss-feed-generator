      <title>End of the game for cybercrime infrastructure: 1025 servers taken down</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down</link>
      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

      <title>What CISOs need to know about new tools for securing MCP servers</title>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model Context Protocol allows AI agents to connect to data sources but the first iteration of this standard &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015222/mcp-uses-and-risks.html"&gt;lacked serious security&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few months, a multitude of vendors appeared to help solve the problem. Is the technology now ready for prime-time, or is it still too early to put into production?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some progress has been made on the core protocol side. In March, support was added for OAuth authentication, and in June, the protocol added support for third-party authentication servers such as Auth0, Okta, or a company’s own identity management system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MCP standards body also launched an official &lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.info/tools/registry/"&gt;MCP registry&lt;/a&gt; in September, in order to address the problem of malicious MCP servers masquerading as legitimate ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But significant security gaps remain. For example, authentication is optional, and the systems are vulnerable to prompt injections, tool poisoning, token theft, cross-server attacks, message tampering and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies looking to get ahead of the competition when it comes to building agentic AI systems have to do a lot of security heavy lifting to keep these tools from exposing all their corporate secrets and sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, over the past few months, vendors have been stepping up. Today, the major AI platforms have added security infrastructure, as have core technology providers, existing cybersecurity vendors, and a fleet of emerging players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-of-different-uses-of-mcp-servers"&gt;Challenges of different uses of MCP servers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of MCP server deployments, and each one has their own security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a company sets up an internal MCP server, on infrastructure they control, to access internal data or tools, to be used by AI agents that they also control. First, a low-risk use of this might be to allow employees to use AI agents to search through non-sensitive documents or databases, such as product descriptions. A higher-risk use case might be to allow access to customer data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, a company might allow their AI agents to access external data sources or tools via MCP servers. Here, one concern might be that the information the AI agents get back might include malicious instructions because either the server or the data source is compromised by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third deployment type is that of an internal MCP server exposing a company’s data or tools to the outside world. Again, this could be a low-risk use case if the MCP server provides access to product descriptions or user manuals. But it could also be extremely risky if MCP servers that allow external partners to connect in and place orders, submit invoices, and change their payment addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are ways to ease into MCP deployments, says Anh Hatzopoulos, co-founder and CEO at PepperMill, a no-code AI platform. For example, an MCP server that goes and gets public LinkedIn information is going to be safer than one that handles financial transactions, she says. “With moving money, I’m surprised that people are going hard at it right now, given the security problems with MCPs. But someone has to do it — and someone will discover those security problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, for many tech companies, especially SaaS vendors, MCP servers are already a must-have. “They can’t wait,” says Peter Nebel, chief strategy officer at cloud consultancy AllCloud. “If they wait, their competition will be there before them and have the MCP advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies that have already released official MCP servers for public use include PayPal, Notion, HubSpot, CloudFlare, Atlassian, Slack, and GitHub. There are also third-party providers building MCP servers. Zapier, for example, currently offers MCP connections to 8,000 different apps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a vendor doesn’t offer their own, official MCP server, someone else might set up unofficial ones that use the vendor’s APIs. For example, there are already MCP servers out there for LinkedIn, Spotify, eBay, YouTube, AWS, Zillow, and many other platforms, some more trustworthy than others. Developers and power users are downloading them and using them to give their AI agents access to those platforms, but it’s not always obvious where some of these less-than-official MCP servers are coming from, who’s maintaining them, and what else they do under the covers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pulse MCP &lt;a href="https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; over 6,000 servers. MCP marketplace MCP.so currently &lt;a href="https://mcp.so/"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; more than 16,000. And a GitHub search for “MCP server” produces more than 45,000 results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-an-mcp-security-platform"&gt;What to look for in an MCP security platform&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether a company connects their own agents to third-party MCP servers, their own MCP servers to third-party agents, or their own servers to their own agents, there’s going to be the potential for data leakage, prompt injections and other security threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means companies will need to check for authorizations and permissions, implement fine-grained access controls, and log everything, says AllCloud’s Nevel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are some other MCP security tools that vendors are offering today:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCP server detection&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s easy for company employees to download and run their own MCP servers. These servers could boost their productivity or they could be a new attack vector. Some MCP security vendors are offering scanning services to help companies find all instances of shadow MCP servers in their environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime protection&lt;/strong&gt;: AI agents communicate with MCP servers in plain English. That creates the potential for prompt injections, data leaks and other security issues. Many MCP security vendors offer tools to monitor all communications for these and similar problems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication and access controls&lt;/strong&gt;: The core MCP protocol now supports OAuth, but that’s just the start. For additional security, vendors offer zero trust and least privilege control frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging and observability&lt;/strong&gt;: Vendors can provide platforms to collect MCP logs, alert security teams about security events or policy violations, collect compliance data, or feed logs into existing security infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vedors-offering-mcp-security-tools"&gt;Vedors offering MCP security tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below, we divide in three sections the list of vendors offering MCP security tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyperscalers"&gt;Hyperscalers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies all-in on a particular cloud platform, going with the MCP tools provided by that particular hyperscaler can be an easy way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AWS launched its own agentic AI platform in July. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore includes a gateway that supports multiple protocols, including MCP, an identity management system and observability. In October, AWS followed this up with a set of guidelines for securing MCP servers with &lt;a href="https://builder.aws.com/content/33oERPjcEutnPmaud1BvlPRP9zR/security-guidelines-for-model-context-protocol-in-aws"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt; best practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced a basic Azure MCP server in April, added support for the Azure Key Vault in May, announced MCP support in the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service in June, and announced Azure API Management support in August. Azure API Management means that MCP servers can have secure and governed access to resources, with observability and control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, Microsoft announced the Microsoft Agent Framework, which includes support for both MCP and the Agent2Agent protocol, protection against prompt injection, PII detection, and multi-agent observability to ensure that the systems are doing what they’re supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud announced its MCP Toolbox for Databases in April with authentication and observability built in. In September, it released a reference architecture for securing MCP servers on the Google Cloud Platform, based around a centralized MCP proxy architecture. It uses the Google Identity Platform to validate identities and issue OAuth tokens, uses Model Armor to check messages for prompt injections, jailbreaks, or sensitive data, and a Secret Manager to store API keys, credentials, and sensitive configuration values. Its Artifact Registry can store MCP server images and scan them for vulnerabilities before they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google also recommends using network-level security controls to isolate MCP servers and reduce the risk of lateral movement. Finally, Google’s Security Command Center can identify unauthorized access and data exfiltration attempts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="major-technology-providers"&gt;Major technology providers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare: Cloudflare announced &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-mcp-server-portals/"&gt;MCP Server Portals&lt;/a&gt;, which enable enterprises to centralize, secure, and observe every MCP connection. This feature is part of Cloudflare One, the company’s secure access service edge (SASE) platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks: The company launched the &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2025/06/securing-ai-agent-innovation-prisma-airs-mcp-server/"&gt;Prisma AIRS MCP Server&lt;/a&gt; in June. It sits between the AI agent and the MCP server and detects malicious content in data, helping protect against prompt injection attacks, as well as web and DNS attacks. Another tool, MCP Security in Cortex Cloud WAAS, sits at the network boundary, and inspects MCP communications for malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SentinelOne: &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/avoiding-mcp-mania-how-to-secure-the-next-frontier-of-ai/"&gt;SentinelOne Singularity Platform&lt;/a&gt; offers visibility into the MCP interaction chain, as well as alerts and automated incident response, for both local and remote MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VMware: In August, parent company Broadcom &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/4045708/vmware-explore-2025-broadcom-tackles-agentic-ai-security-challenges.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that VMware Cloud Foundation will offer more security for agentic workflows, including MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="startups"&gt;Startups&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acuvity: &lt;a href="https://acuvity.ai/"&gt;Acuvity&lt;/a&gt; secures MCP servers by hardening them with least-privilege execution, immutable runtimes, continuous vulnerability scanning, authentication, and threat detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akto: API security company Akto launched an &lt;a href="https://www.akto.io/mcp-security"&gt;MCP security&lt;/a&gt; solution in June, claiming to be the first dedicated security solution specifically built to protect MCP servers. It includes a discovery tool for finding the MCP servers deployed in corporate environments, security testing tools, and monitoring and threat detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Invariant Labs: Their &lt;a href="https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan"&gt;MCP-Scan&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source scanner that performs static analysis of MCP servers and does real-time monitoring to detect tool poisoning attacks, rug pulls, and prompt injection attacks. A commercial product, Invariant Guardrails, is a proxy that sits between AI agents and MCP servers and protects against project injections and other MCP security threats, and allows companies to impose rules such as prohibiting PII from going to external email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Javelin: The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.getjavelin.com/ai-security"&gt;AI Security Fabric platform&lt;/a&gt; includes MCP security, such as functionality to scan for risky servers, or to block or require review of agent tools or data requests. In addition, MCP guardrails stop unsafe calls and poisoned inputs in real-time and prevent prompt injections and data leakage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lasso Security: Open source &lt;a href="https://github.com/lasso-security/mcp-gateway"&gt;MCP gateway&lt;/a&gt; that allows configuration and lifecycle management of MCP servers and sanitizes sensitive information in MCP messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.mcptotal.io/"&gt;MCPTotal&lt;/a&gt;: Offers a hub to manage, run and monitor MCP servers in a secure, sandboxed environment, as well as a gateway to protect AI workflows interacting with both internal and external MCP servers, and a governance tool to monitor and enforce AI tool use policies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noma: Recently launched &lt;a href="https://noma.security/solutions/ai-agent-security/"&gt;AI Agent Security&lt;/a&gt; solution offers support for discovery of MCP connections, vulnerability scanning, access policy enforcement, real-time prompt guardrails, and audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obot: The &lt;a href="https://obot.ai/"&gt;Obot MCP gateway&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source platform to manage MCP servers, define security access policies, and track usage and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Operant: Operant &lt;a href="https://www.operant.ai/solutions/mcp-gateway"&gt;MCP Gateway&lt;/a&gt; automatically catalogs MCP tools, discovers AI agents, and tracks traffic between agents and servers to eliminate MCP blind spots. It can also identify threat vectors such as tool poisoning, jailbreaks and unauthorized access, prevent data leaks, and establish a centralized governance framework for agents and tools across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Solo: The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.solo.io/products/agentgateway-enterprise"&gt;Agent Gateway&lt;/a&gt; was overhauled in August to support MCP and A2A protocols and protects against malicious prompts and data leaks, enforces strong authentication, and centralizes logging and tracing for every interaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teleport: Its &lt;a href="https://goteleport.com/use-cases/secure-model-context-protocol/"&gt;Secure MCP&lt;/a&gt; tool for its Infrastructure Identity Platform allows companies to unify how they govern human, machine, workload, device, and AI identities. MCP Security provides identity, access control, governance, and audit tools in a zero trust and least privilege environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Rogue MCP servers can take over Cursor’s built-in browser</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089046/rogue-mcp-servers-can-take-over-cursors-built-in-browser.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI agents and coding copilots are shaking up how — and what — developers code. But they’re also rapidly expanding the attack surface of developer machines&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest example: Security researchers have shown how a rogue Model Context Protocol (MCP) server can inject malicious code into the built-in browser feature of Cursor, a popular AI-powered code editor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrate how a single malicious MCP server can replace login pages inside Cursor’s internal browser with an attacker-controlled page that harvests credentials and sends them to a remote attacker,” researchers from AI cybersecurity firm Knostic.ai wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.knostic.ai/blog/mcp-hijacked-cursor-browser"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; shared with CSO. “We also show how that same capability allows an attacker to fully compromise the victim’s workstation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally developed by Anthropic to facilitate communication between large language models (LLMs) and external data sources or applications to improve workflow context, MCP has become a key component for developing AI agents that automate tasks by leveraging external tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protocol uses a client-server architecture, in which applications expose functionality to LLMs through an MCP server and AI agents or applications connect to those services through an MCP client. Integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code — and those based on it, like Cursor and Windsurf — natively support integration with MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enhance security, most IDE vendors maintain repositories with vetted MCP servers, but IDE users can also deploy custom servers manually. Such servers can be found all over the internet, including GitHub. Earlier this year, researchers found hundreds of MCP servers in public GitHub repositories that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4012712/misconfigured-mcp-servers-expose-ai-agent-systems-to-compromise.html"&gt;had dangerous misconfigurations&lt;/a&gt;, including default exposure to untrusted networks and OS command injection paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attacking-cursor-and-other-vs-code-based-ides"&gt;Attacking Cursor and other VS Code-based IDEs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cursor is essentially a fork of VS Code with code added to turn it into an AI-assisted coding tool, whereas VS Code gets its AI capabilities through extensions. Knostic researcher Dor Munis, who developed the MCP attack against Cursor, told CSO that unlike VS Code, which performs integrity checks of its own files, Cursor does not. As a result, any modification of its own code will not present the user with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VS Code, and by extension Cursor and other VS Code forks, is built on Electron, a framework used to develop cross-platform applications with Node.js and the Blink browser engine from Chrome. Because of this, these applications employ a JavaScript interpreter. As IDEs, they also have file system access and elevated permissions to perform tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knostic researchers recently published &lt;a href="https://www.knostic.ai/blog/demonstrating-code-injection-vscode-cursor"&gt;a proof-of-concept attack against Cursor implemented through a malicious extension&lt;/a&gt; that injected malicious JavaScript into the running IDE to execute actions and manipulate its user interface. Malicious extensions have also been found &lt;a href="http://csoonline.com/article/4072829/tigerjacks-malicious-vscode-extensions-mine-steal-and-stay-hidden.html"&gt;in the VSCode Marketplace and the OpenVSX registry&lt;/a&gt;, which Cursor also uses, including &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076718/self-propagating-worm-found-in-marketplaces-for-visual-studio-code-extensions-2.html"&gt;a self-propagating worm that harvests credentials&lt;/a&gt; from developer machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knostic’s newly unveiled attack is similar in concept, but delivered via a malicious MCP server, it expands the attack surface beyond extensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An MCP server should be treated exactly like VS Code extensions in terms of security,” Munis said. That’s because MCP servers are essentially downloaded to run on your computer, and inherit the permissions of the IDE you use, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his proof-of-concept attack, Munis shows that an MCP server can inject JavaScript code into &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser"&gt;the built-in browser&lt;/a&gt; that Cursor recently added to allow developers to visually test changes to their application code and to allow Cursor’s AI agent to automatically perform tasks that require browsing. Using this technique, Munis replaced the browser’s actively displayed page with a log-in prompt, like in a phishing scenario, but without the URL ever changing — in other words, injected code’s changes happen on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, the impact of such an attack would depend on what the victim is doing in the browser. Developers might be displaying sensitive data from the web app they’re working on, or they might be logged into a service. It’s worth noting that the internal browser saves authentication cookies for the session and those could also be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack was developed to prove successful JavaScript code injection via an MCP server, but just like with the extension attack, it could be expanded to perform other malicious actions inside the Cursor IDE itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defenses"&gt;Defenses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations must review and control, both through policy and access controls, the IDE extensions and MCP servers their developers use. They should do this just like they should be vetting application dependencies from package registries such as npm or PyPI to prevent the compromise of developer machines or inheriting vulnerabilities in their code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers are increasingly using VS Code extensions as an attack vector to target developers and it’s only a matter of time before they’ll start abusing MCP servers more widely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Try to find the project’s GitHub repo and review the code,” the Knostic team advised. “This is a program you install on your computer that can do anything. If there’s doubt about its credibility, DO NOT USE IT.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using auto-run modes, in which agents are allowed to perform tasks automatically inside the IDE without a human approving the steps, also known as YOLO mode, should also be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Never blindly enable anything, especially MCP functionality,” the team warned. “Don’t assume that everything your AI agent generated is as you expected. Read through the code before you perform actions in the embedded browser.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp#security-considerations"&gt;In its MCP documentation&lt;/a&gt;, Cursor itself warns developers to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify an MCP server’s source and only install from trusted developers and repositories&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check what data and APIs the server is supposed to access&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use API keys with restricted permissions&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Audit the server’s code for critical integrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Operation Chargeback: 4.3 million cardholders affected, EUR 300 million in damages</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-chargeback-43-million-cardholders-affected-eur-300-million-in-damages</link>
      <description>On 4 November 2025, an international coordinated action day targeted three major fraud and money laundering networks as part of Operation “Chargeback.” Led by the Cybercrime Department (Landeszentralstelle Cybercrime) of the General Prosecutor's Office (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) in Koblenz, Germany, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the operation has been investigating these networks since December 2020. More than 60 house searches were conducted and a total of 18 arrest warrants executed. The criminal networks are suspected of misusing credit card data from over 4.3 million cardholders across 193 countries. In total, the estimated damage from the fraud scheme exceeds EUR 300 million, with attempted damages amounting to over EUR 750 million.</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI opens door to new ID challenges: Report</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089682/agentic-ai-opens-door-to-new-id-challenges-report.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research released Thursday by Rubrik Zero Labs finds that the AI wave, and in particular agentic AI, has created a “troubling gap between the expanding identity attack surface and organizations’ ability to recover from resulting compromises.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the report, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://zerolabs.rubrik.com/reports/the-identity-crisis" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Identity Crisis: Understanding &amp;amp; Building Resilience Against Identity-Driven Threats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the result is a surge of both non-human identities (NHIs) and agentic identities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key findings revealed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;89% of organizations have “fully or partially incorporated AI agents into their identity infrastructure, and an additional 10% have plans to.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Of those polled, 58% estimate that, in the next 12 months, half or more of the cyberattacks they must deal with will be “driven by agentic AI.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Industry &lt;a href="https://www.cyberark.com/press/machine-identities-outnumber-humans-by-more-than-80-to-1-new-report-exposes-the-exponential-threats-of-fragmented-identity-security/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; contend that NHIs now outnumber human users by 82-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, a &lt;a href="https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/25/new-rubrik-research-finds-identity-resilience-is-imperative-as-ai-wave-floods-the-workplace-with-ai-agents" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from Rubrik states, as organizations integrate agents into their workflows, the increase in NHIs will continue to outpace the growth of human identities,  and securing them “will become as essential — if not more so — as securing human identities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, authors of the report state, “as traditional network boundaries have dissolved amid cloud migrations, remote work adoption, and now agentic AI, identity is no longer merely a control layer. It has become the primary attack surface, which threat actors weaponize to gain access to IT environments and ‘live off of the land’ over the course of an attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of today’s breaches, they write, are predicated on exploiting trust and valid credentials rather than circumventing network defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Under-the-radar crisis exists&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmariappan" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kavitha Mariappan&lt;/a&gt;, chief transformation officer at Rubrik, said, “the rise of identity-driven attacks is changing the face of cyber defense. Managing identities in the era of AI has become a complex endeavor, especially with the labyrinth of NHIs. We have an under-the-radar crisis on our hands where a single compromised credential can grant full access to an organization’s most sensitive data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “comprehensive Identity Resilience is absolutely critical to cyber recovery in this new landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was prompted, she said in an email to &lt;em&gt;CSOonline,&lt;/em&gt; because “the cyber defense landscape has fundamentally changed, creating a significant gap between the expanding identity attack surface and an organization’s ability to recover [from an attack]. As traditional network boundaries have dissolved due to cloud migration, remote work, and the accelerating adoption of agentic AI, identity has become a primary vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors “are overwhelmingly exploiting trusted and valid credentials to &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; in, not break in,” Mariappan explained. “These attacks are further complicated by the labyrinth of non-human identities, like API keys and AI agents, which are surging across the enterprise and are proving difficult to manage. Unlike with human identities, these NHIs can be difficult to revoke and often slip through the cracks, leading to poor lifecycle governance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, head of Canadian security awareness training provider firm Beauceron Security, said he agrees with the report’s findings for a key reason: “[While] phishing and social engineering overall are where attacks start, identity and access management (IAM) practices are where the fire gets roaring.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations, he said, “need modern approaches to IAM and employee cyber education and engagement. The employee education doesn’t just help them spot and stop threats, you can help them understand why good IAM processing technology is required.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed out, “[there is] a reason why &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/648894/identity-based-security-threats-are-growing-rapidly-report.html?utm=hybrid_search" target="_blank"&gt;identity and access management&lt;/a&gt; is the foundation of a security program. When it’s done poorly, the impacts reverberate throughout an organization during an attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shipley said that he often tells clients, “IAM is the bottom of the cyber equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;. Where humans need food and shelter to survive, digital systems need strong IAM practices to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In our work around the world, we’ve seen that as organizations get larger and more complex, it’s far more likely they have huge issues in identity management,” he said. “This isn’t the kind of problem that technology alone can fix, regardless of the vendor. It takes understanding people, process, culture, and technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="agentic-ai-like-a-stick-of-dynamite-thrown-into-a-fishpond"&gt;Agentic AI ‘like a stick of dynamite thrown into a fishpond’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, said Shipley, “it doesn’t matter what AI-powered IAM tool you have if you allow people to bypass processes to grant, remove, or change access because the process for approvals is [seen] as too slow or cumbersome.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The least favourite thing to find when you’re investigating a cyber incident, he said, “is no way to trace who did what because there’s nothing in the logs. The second worst is to find a bunch of identities that no one knows how they got there or how they had the access they did.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shipley described agentic AI as “basically a stick of dynamite thrown into a fishpond when it comes to identity, and the results look the same. If organizations can’t tell if a human or their agent performed a set of actions, they can’t properly understand if they have a software vulnerability, an issue with employee awareness or motivation on security, or even worse, an insider threat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, he said, “the whole concept of zero trust just got wiped out. Agents rely on huge amounts of trust and frankly, they haven’t earned it and have done everything they can possibly do to show they shouldn’t be trusted. From hallucinations to hijacking, this technology is not ready for prime time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/thomas-randall" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Randall&lt;/a&gt;, research lead at Info-Tech Research Group, added that most of the Rubrik Zero Labs report “validates what the industry already knows. For years, Info-Tech research has shown that identity is a prime attack surface, that zero trust/least privilege/continuous verification are best practices, and that security training is imperative.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attack-surface-to-drastically-increase"&gt;Attack surface to drastically increase&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that two elements stood out to him: “First is bridging human and non-human identity under a single umbrella; typically, we might understand these under separate domains of IAM vs DevOps secrets management, respectively. The report’s point is that attackers don’t respect those org-chart boundaries, so security teams should think beyond those boundaries, too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, said Randall, “this framing overlooks that these identities are operationally different. While both authenticate and authorize, the tooling, telemetry, RACI, and risk models differ. A single ‘identity plane’ may be the goal conceptually, but practically, it’s hard to implement across those divergent ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second element is, he said, “the stark claim that non-human identities now outnumber human users by around 82:1. As organizations start developing more AI agents (especially if individuals have free rein to develop their own copilots or GPTs), the attack surface drastically increases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Randall noted, “each copilot or GPT can hold API keys, OAuth tokens, or delegated permissions (for example, ‘read SharePoint docs, query CRM data, send emails.’). This is certainly where I think organizations need to be concerned: the gap between agentic AI rollout and AI governance grows increasingly wider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations, he said, “have to be disciplined in controlling agent creation, credentialing, and lifecycle management; otherwise, the attack surface potentially increases drastically.” Security leaders must understand that IAM tools alone won’t protect against or help them restore the integrity of their identity infrastructure in the event of a compromise, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, said Mariappan, they must also understand that IAM tools alone won’t protect against or help them restore the integrity of their identity infrastructure in the event of a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, she said, “while 87% of IT and security leaders plan to change their IAM providers, 60% have already switched providers in the last three years, signaling the industry’s dissatisfaction with current solutions for tackling identity-based threats. Our research reveals that a comprehensive identity resilience strategy is needed for when, not if, an attack strikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 14, 2025: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a&gt;The CIO100 and CSO30 ASEAN and Hong Kong Awards Gala on November 12, 2025, delivered a powerful validation of the region’s technology leadership maturity. CIO ASEAN and CSO ASEAN had the privilege of hosting an evening that brought together the most elite CIO100 and CSO30 award winners, and technology teams from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;. They demonstrate that this region is firmly established as a strategic technology hub driving global digital transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rigor in Judging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The awards maintained editorial independence through a select panel of CIO and CSOonline.com executive editors who evaluated all nominations against a single consistent measure: clear, measurable business impact. The best submissions demonstrated business value realization, not just technology deployment&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSO30 Awards: Recognizing Excellence Across Three Dimensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CSO30 Leadership &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Business Value Awards&lt;/strong&gt; demonstrated remarkable breadth across the region’s cybersecurity landscape and a diverse cohort spanning financial services, healthcare, energy, telecommunications, and insurance sectors. These individuals exemplified two critical competencies: first, embedding security as a strategic business enabler, and second, fostering collaborative ownership of cyber resilience across technical and business leadership. Their recognition underscores the regional shift toward security as a business transformation lever, a maturation that distinguishes leading organizations from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From strategy and psychology to history and decision-making, these are the books CISOs recommend to sharpen your thinking, influence your leadership style, and help navigate the complexity of modern security careers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="exploring-risk-from-different-angles"&gt;Exploring risk from different angles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs, not surprisingly, are interested in risk as it relates to cybersecurity, with some keen to understand future risk measurement and how to make better decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112?cc=au&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;"&gt;Superintelligence&lt;/a&gt; by Nick Bostrom and &lt;a href="https://www.thegrayrhino.com/"&gt;The Gray Rhino&lt;/a&gt; by Michele Wucker were put forward by Cribl CISO Mike Lyons. “Superintelligence is a very interesting look at the risks and rewards of AI and how to secure it. It can invoke an existential crisis as AI continues to play a larger role in our daily lives,” says Lyons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Gray Rhino invites readers to rethink their priorities. “It highlights how ‘highly probable, high impact, yet neglected threats plague us every day and it takes grit and resolve to reduce their impact by making change happen,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ai-mirror-9780197759066?cc=au&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;"&gt;The AI Mirror&lt;/a&gt; by Shannon Vallor was recommended by Grammarly CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gidouglas"&gt;Giles Douglas&lt;/a&gt; “although probably not for the reason you might expect”. The central thesis is that generative AI is trained on backwards-looking data and Vallor is deeply skeptical of artificial general intelligence. “However, what struck me most is how this analysis applies to how generative AI is being embedded into security products,” Douglas says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI integration has allowed us to find anomalous patterns and analyze data at scale, but the book’s focus on the flaws of this approach highlights the ethical implications of doing so. It demonstrates that these systems still need judgment — a human in the loop — and can struggle to find truly novel exploits of systems that fall outside of their training data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The book considers the implications of feeding massive amounts of security data into such systems can also have a side effect of building surveillance technology where there is pervasive monitoring, blurring the lines between robust monitoring and invasive practices. “My key takeaway: We still need humans to oversee security systems. The most effective programs will be those that thoughtfully integrate AI capabilities while maintaining strong human oversight and ethical guardrails.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubbardresearch.com/shop/how-to-measure-anything-in-cybersecurity-risk-2e-signed-by-doug-hubbard/"&gt;How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Douglas W. Hubbard and Richard Seiersen, was recommended by several CISOs including Daniel Schatz, Qiagen’s CISO, and Wolfgang Goerlich, faculty IANS and Oakland County’s CISO. James Blake, Cohesity’s CISO, said it’s a useful resource that provides spreadsheets and methods for semi-quantitative risk assessment. Similar to FAIR (factor analysis of information risk), this book provides tools and approaches for more accurate risk measurement beyond the traditional risk matrix. “I’d recommend this book to anyone working in cyber risk because it offers meaningful ways to analyze and communicate risk to business leaders,” Blake says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227815/superforecasting-by-philip-e-tetlock-and-dan-gardner/"&gt;Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction&lt;/a&gt; by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner, was also recommended by Schatz. The book takes a closer look at what makes or breaks good forecasts in a well-written and entertaining manner. “I think this is a useful book for anyone trying to wrap their head around what the future might bring and consequently it should be of particular interest to risk managers,” tells Schatz. “Along with the fundamentals of good forecasts and many examples, the authors provide good guidance on how to get to better estimates based on some basic steps.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="improving-focus-and-decision-making-in-complex-environments"&gt;Improving focus and decision making in complex environments&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a role defined by continual alerts and competing priorities, CISOs need to rely on their decision-making skills and an ability to find focus. These books explore how to reduce digital noise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Schatz suggested &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374533557/thinkingfastandslow/"&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Kahneman that explores the dual systems of the brain — fast, intuitive thinking, and slow, rational thinking — how the human mind can be tripped up by error and prejudice, and strategies for making better decisions. Schatz recommended the book for the insights into how humans make decisions and when they’re most vulnerable to mistakes. “This understanding is essential for effectively managing human risk and selecting security strategies that account for real-world behavior,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a related topic and co-written by Daniel Kahneman, &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/daniel-kahneman/noise/9780316451406/"&gt;Noise&lt;/a&gt; explores why humans are so susceptible to noise in judgment — and what we can do about it. It was recommended by Wolfgang Goerlich. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elliott Franklin, CISO at Fortitude Re, recommended &lt;a href="https://www.marcawolfe.com/yeah-but-book/"&gt;Yeah, But: Cut Through The Noise To Live, Learn, And Lead Better&lt;/a&gt; by Marc Wolfe because it provides readers with strategies to find clear headspace for thinking and making better decisions — something that’s important for busy CISOs. “Wolfe speaks directly to the internal dialogue that often holds leaders back — those rationalizations that delay change or innovation. It encourages cutting through noise, both external and internal, to lead with clarity and confidence,” Franklin says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gretchen Rubin’s &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/225164/better-than-before-by-gretchen-rubin/"&gt;Better Than Before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and Cal Newport’s &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/575667/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport/"&gt;Digital Minimalism&lt;/a&gt; offer tools to protect what matters most — your time, focus, and well-being, says Franklin. “Security leaders often operate in “always on” mode, but Cal Newport’s push toward intentional tech use is a vital reminder: your attention is a resource, and boundaries are not a luxury, they’re a necessity. Meanwhile, Rubin’s habit framework helps leaders design systems to support their goals, whether that’s better sleep, less email, or more presence at home. Together, these books form a toolkit for leading better — not just at work, but in life,” adds Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Human+Hacked:+My+Life+and+Lessons+as+the+World's+First+Augmented+Ethical+Hacker-p-9781394269167"&gt;Human Hacked: My Life and Lessons as the World’s First Augmented Ethical Hacker&lt;/a&gt; by Len Noe was recommended by George Gerchow, faculty at IANS Research and Bedrock Security’s CSO. The book goes beyond the hype to explore the complexity of augmented decision-making and the unintended consequences we’re already seeing. “Len pulls back the curtain on how humans, not just machines, are being reshaped by AI. His point of view is grounded, provocative, and seriously worth reading. Full disclosure: Len is a good friend. People like him are rare and, honestly, a little scary. I’m just glad he’s on our side,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-human-risk-in-cybersecurity"&gt;Understanding human risk in cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to security, CISOs know better than most that managing risks and vulnerabilities lies in human behaviour as much as technical tools. These books provide expert insights into the human side of cybersecurity, such as social engineering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Cuckoos-Egg/Cliff-Stoll/9781668048160"&gt;The Cuckoo’s Egg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by Cliff Stoll was recommended by International Seaways CIO/CISO Amit Basu as one of the most important early narratives of cyber intrusion and defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cliff Stoll’s meticulous pursuit of a 75-cent accounting anomaly exposed an international espionage ring long before cybersecurity became a defined discipline,” says Basu. “His story demonstrates enduring principles of our field: pay attention to small signals, follow the evidence with rigor, and build partnerships across technical teams, telecom providers, and law enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a time when automated detection and AI-driven analytics dominate, the book is a reminder that patient investigation, detailed logging, and curiosity often provide the first clues to a major breach. For cybersecurity professionals, it also highlights the human side of defense. “Stoll faced skepticism, shifting priorities, and bureaucratic delays, challenges still familiar to CISOs and security teams,” he says. “His persistence and ability to translate technical findings into action across institutions underscore the leadership and communication skills that remain essential. I recommend this book because it combines the excitement of a real-life thriller with lessons on vigilance, collaboration, and creative problem solving that continue to guide effective cyber defense.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Art+of+Deception:+Controlling+the+Human+Element+of+Security-p-9780764542800"&gt;The Art of Deception&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/646741/infamous-hacker-kevin-mitnick-dead-at-59.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Mitnick&lt;/a&gt;, was recommended by Gaurav Kapil, CISO at Bread Financial, because its core message remains relevant today. “One of the original and most well-known hackers, Kevin Mitnick shares fascinating real-world examples of social engineering and the human side of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While it’s an older book, it remains a foundational read for anyone interested in understanding how attackers exploit trust to breach systems,” Kapil says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Secrets+and+Lies:+Digital+Security+in+a+Networked+World-p-9780471453802"&gt;Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World&lt;/a&gt; by Bruce Schneier is also recommended by Kapil because it breaks down technical concepts in an accessible way. “A highly respected voice in cybersecurity, Bruce Schneier offers timeless insights into the complexities of digital security. It also explores why focusing solely on technology isn’t enough and requires addressing human behavior, in addition to reevaluating organizational practices,” Kapil says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/611687/the-art-thief-by-michael-finkel/"&gt;The Art Thief&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Finkel, about the world’s most prolific art thief who stole hundreds of valuable pieces from museums and evaded law enforcement for years, had a remarkable number of connections to cybersecurity, according to Katie Jenkins, CISO at Liberty Mutual. “The overarching theme of theft in plain sight had connections to social engineering and how — similar to cyber adversaries — skill in deceiving others can yield remarkable gain for the criminal actor,” says Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also highlights the critical role in identifying and managing vulnerabilities — whether it’s physical security in museums and galleries or virtual security in the case of cybersecurity. “In both this literary world and the world of a cybersecurity professional, the core connection is about protecting valuable assets from resourceful, motivated adversaries. Both highlight human elements — trust, psychology, ingenuity — as well as technical/physical controls,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rethinking-what-effective-leadership-means"&gt;Rethinking what effective leadership means&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It takes dedication to be the best leader. Cybersecurity leaders can turn to books that offer guidance and lessons on developing strong leadership skills, but they’re not always the standard management books.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People/Dale-Carnegie/9781982171452"&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/a&gt; by Dale Carnegie and &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/malcolm-gladwell/david-and-goliath/9780316204361/?lens=little-brown"&gt;David and Goliath&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Gladwell are two books that Christina Cruz, director of cybersecurity at Advance, returns to again and again. “Carnegie’s book has shaped how I lead and communicate, especially in cybersecurity where influence often matters more than authority. It’s helped me build trust across teams, navigate tough conversations with empathy, and connect with stakeholders who don’t live in the technical weeds,” Cruz says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gladwell’s David and Goliath reframed how Cruz thinks about risk and resilience. “In our field, we’re constantly facing outsized threats with limited resources, and this book reminded me that being the underdog can be an advantage — if you’re willing to think differently and act boldly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Both books have challenged and expanded my perspective — not just as a cybersecurity leader, but as a person. They’ve helped me approach problems with more creativity, lead with more intention, and stay grounded in the human side of what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304046/start-with-why-15th-anniversary-edition-by-simon-sinek/"&gt;Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action&lt;/a&gt; by Simon Sinek is another pick by Amit Basu because it’s a powerful framework for leading teams and shaping strategy that is relevant to cybersecurity and technology leadership. “Simon Sinek shows that enduring success begins with a clear purpose, your ‘why’ before focusing on ‘how’ or ‘what’,” says Basu. “It helps transform security from a compliance obligation into a shared strategic advantage. The book also reinforces how purpose drives trust and resilience,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinek illustrates that people follow leaders who inspire, not just those who manage. In cybersecurity, where pressure and burnout are constant risks, a clearly stated ‘why’ keeps teams motivated and engaged through crises and long-term initiatives. “I recommend Start with Why because it offers a clear and practical model for connecting daily operations to a larger vision, enabling leaders to inspire commitment and foster a culture where security and innovation thrive together,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tablegroup.com/topics-and-resources/teamwork-5-dysfunctions/?srsltid=AfmBOopPEnQSxGO9rGPyQ9ko6a5bNfCvn95yCPS8yx_g19NsFzw9UB-B"&gt;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&lt;/a&gt; by Patrick Lencioni comes highly recommend by Vasanth Madhure, Couchbase CISO. “It completely changed my perspective on what makes a team work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The book breaks down why so many teams struggle, starting with the most basic issue: a lack of trust. When a team can’t be vulnerable with each other, they avoid healthy conflict, which leads to a lack of real buy-in and accountability. This all adds up to a team that simply isn’t getting meaningful results. “Ultimately, the book’s core message is that trust is the bedrock of any successful team or relationship—not just at work, but in everyday life. For me, this is a daily practice, especially in security, where building trust with everyone, from my team to our customers, is absolutely crucial,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a CISO, I’ve learned that effective cybersecurity leadership isn’t just about technical experience or even business strategy. It’s also about possessing the necessary skills to be a trusted and empathic leader,” says Vanta CISO Jadee Hanson. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hanson nominated &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557595/dare-to-lead-by-brene-brown-phd-msw/"&gt;Dare to Lead&lt;/a&gt; by Brené Brown because it challenges the traditional notion of leadership by emphasizing emotional intelligence and resilience — qualities that are essential for leading in high-stakes environments. “The book helps leaders foster cultures of accountability and openness, which are crucial for building transparent and adaptive organizations. It’s a must-read for leaders looking to cultivate trust through genuine connection and authenticity, within their teams and across their organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Good leadership is also about providing the right feedback and with this in mind, &lt;a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250245786/radicalcandorfullyrevisedupdatededition/"&gt;Radical Candor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by Kim Scott was recommended by Bethany DeLude, Carlyle Group’s CISO. The book highlights the value of honest, specific and direct feedback delivered in an empathetic, timely and respectful manner. “Her use of a practical and actionable framework, bolstered by real world examples, creates an instructive and compelling map for building a culture of open communication, accountability and employee development,” says DeLude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-the-cybersecurity-industry"&gt;Understanding the cybersecurity industry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joseph-menn/cult-of-the-dead-cow/9781541762374/?lens=publicaffairs"&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by Joseph Mennwas put forward by Helen Patton, Cisco CISO and co-founder of the Cyber Canon Project, as an important history of the people in the cybersecurity industry. “It covers one of the most famous hacking groups and describes the impact of cybersecurity on businesses, personal and political lives. It’s also a well-written, engaging read that will inform and entertain security and non-security people alike,” says Patton.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/cybersecurity-myths-and/9780137929214/"&gt;Cybersecurity Myths and Misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; by Eugene H. Spafford, Leigh Metcalf and Josiah Dykstra was also recommended by Patton because it explains why “conventional wisdom” of the industry doesn’t really seem to work. “The authors have done a masterful job in explaining why things that might seem logical don’t, in practical terms, make sense. They dissect how the security industry has impacted how we talk about cybersecurity processes, and how that can sometimes be more harmful than helpful,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The book explores long-held industry practices that are now just “understood” and why those same practices no longer make sense. “They reveal how humans bring faulty assumptions and biases to the way we do cybersecurity. This book is one that every security practitioner should keep close, for them and for the people they work with.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/cyber-for-builders"&gt;Cyber for Builders: The Essential Guide to Building a Cybersecurity Startup&lt;/a&gt; by Ross Haleliuk comes highly recommended by Lavy Stokhamer, global head of cybersecurity operations, Standard Chartered. “As CISOs, we’ve moved far beyond being technical guardians. Today, we are business leaders. Our role demands not only securing the enterprise, but also making strategic bets on which technologies, vendors, and innovations will shape the future of our organisations,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s why Ross Haleliuk’s book is such a valuable read. It peels back the curtain on the start-up world – how cybersecurity companies are built, what drives their success, and why so many fail. It’s not about code or exploits, but about the market forces, investor pressures, and go-to-market strategies that ultimately determine whether a solution becomes a lasting partner or a short-lived experiment,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For technology leaders, this perspective is a strategic advantage. It sharpens the ability to separate enduring innovation from hype, anticipate which startups will thrive, and make decisions that align security with business resilience and growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="books-are-a-reminder-that-theres-more-to-life-than-work"&gt;Books are a reminder that there’s more to life than work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a profession that rarely switches off, books offer CISOs a chance to reflect, recharge, and reconnect with meaning beyond the day job. As a CISO, it’s easy to get drawn into the never-ending work day and Thornton Wilder’s &lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/our-town-a-play-in-three-acts-thornton-wilder?variant=32154020544546"&gt;Our Town&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is a reminder to put work into perspective. “When I read — and reread — the book, I’m reminded to nurture and be present in my whole life,” says DeLude.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeLude recommended this book because it’s a reminder that paying better attention to balance unlocks creativity and leads to greater impact in professional life. “By reflecting, I’ve solved more of the hardest work problems after a weekend of family fun or while out on a walk than stationed in my office.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-alchemist-paulo-coelho?variant=41227794874402"&gt;The Alchemist &lt;/a&gt;by Paulo Coelho, a book with a simple story but a powerful message, was recommended by Nicole Dove, head of security engineering, Games, at Riot Games. “The main character is on a journey to follow a dream — he’s unsure and knows he’s deviating from what tradition says he should do — but he follows his heart. That’s something I truly relate to. I’ve read the book numerous times, and each time I walk away with a new gem. No matter the phase of life I’m in, I can always relate to the character and a stop along his journey. In the end, what he discovers is even greater than he imagined. And that is a story that I too hope to tell,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final recommendation is a book that challenges professionals to rethink their purpose and value in IT, according to Fortitude Re’s Elliott Franklin. &lt;a href="https://www.iuniverse.com/en/bookstore/bookdetails/134070-GET-OUT-OF-I-T-WHILE-YOU-CAN"&gt;Get Out of I.T. While You Can: A Guide to Excellence for People in I.T.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;by Craig Schiefelbein. “For CISOs and cybersecurity leaders, it’s a bold reminder that excellence isn’t just technical — it’s about strategic impact and personal fulfillment. If your role no longer aligns with your values, it might be time to reimagine your path, not abandon it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Der jetzt vom Bundestag beschlossene Gesetzesentwurf sorgt weiterhin für Gesprächsstoff. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;ImageFlow – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Bundestag hat den &lt;a href="https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2025/kw46-de-nis-2-1123138" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gesetzesentwurf der Bundesregierung zur Umsetzung der NIS-2-Richtlinie&lt;/a&gt; am 13. November 2025 verabschiedet. Union, SPD und AfD stimmten dafür. Die Grünen, denen das Gesetzt nicht weit genug geht, votierten dagegen. Die Linksfraktion enthielt sich.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Von den neuen Vorgaben sind schätzungsweise 29.850 Unternehmen und Behörden der Bundesverwaltung betroffen. Diese müssen nun nicht nur mehr Prävention betreiben, sondern auch gewisse Mindeststandards einhalten, etwa in Bezug auf Risikoanalysen, Notfallpläne, Backup-Konzepte oder Verschlüsselung.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zudem sind betroffene Einrichtungen dazu verpflichtet, das Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) über alle relevanten IT-Sicherheitsvorfälle zu informieren. Nach einem Cyberangriff müssen Unternehmen diesen binnen 24 Stunden melden, nach 72 Stunden einen Zwischenstand liefern und innerhalb eines Monats einen Abschlussbericht vorlegen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein weiterer Punkt: Mit dem Gesetz bekommt das BSI mehr Aufsichtsbefugnisse und kann bei schwerwiegenden Verstößen sogar Bußgelder verhängen. Auch der Bundes-CISO wird künftig bei der Sicherheitsbehörde angesiedelt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="neue-regel-zu-kritischen-it-komponenten"&gt;Neue Regel zu kritischen IT-Komponenten&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus enthält der Gesetzentwurf auch Regelungen zur „Untersagung des Einsatzes von kritischen Komponenten“. Sie sollen regeln, wann Hardware, Software oder Cloud-Dienste aus bestimmten Ländern, durch die Spionage- oder Sabotagemöglichkeiten bestehen könnten, verboten werden können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Solche Verbote soll nun das Bundesinnenministerium in Abstimmung mit dem jeweils betroffenen Ministerium aussprechen, „wenn der Einsatz die öffentliche Ordnung oder Sicherheit der Bundesrepublik Deutschland voraussichtlich beeinträchtigt.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kritik-von-experten"&gt;Kritik von Experten&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Bitkom hält von der kurzfristig in das Gesetzgebungsverfahren eingebrachten Neuregelung zu „kritischen Komponenten“ allerdings nichts. „Unternehmen brauchen verlässliche Rahmenbedingungen, Verbote können erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Geschäftstätigkeit haben“, kritisiert Bitkom-Präsident Ralf Wintergeist in einer &lt;a href="https://www.bitkom.org/Presse/Presseinformation/Cybersicherheit-Bundestag-NIS2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mitteilung&lt;/a&gt;. „Vor solch wichtigen Entscheidungen müssen die Betroffenen unbedingt vorab konsultiert werden.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nach Ansicht des Digitalverbands sollte die Definition von kritischen Komponenten auch künftig auf Grundlage technischer Kriterien durch die Bundesnetzagentur und das BSI erfolgen – nicht federführend durch das Bundesinnenministerium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch der &lt;a href="https://www.eco.de/presse/eco-verband-der-internetwirtschaft-zur-nis-2-spaet-gestartet-jetzt-entscheidend-deutschland-muss-vertrauen-und-klarheit-schaffen/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eco Verband&lt;/a&gt; warnte bereits vor dem Beschluss des Bundestags, dass diese Eingriffsbefugnisse bei „kritischen Komponenten“ zu Unsicherheit führen. „Neu ist dabei, dass das Bundesinnenministerium künftig auch ohne Meldung des Betreibers aktiv werden kann, um Komponenten zu verbieten. Für Unternehmen bedeutet das: Einschätzungen des Innenministeriums können kostspielige Austauschpflichten nach sich ziehen“, erklärt Ulrich Plate, Leiter der Kompetenzgruppe KRITIS beim eco.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aus wirtschaftlicher Sicht sei das ein Risiko für Investitionsklarheit und Vertrauen. Zugleich würden Aufsicht und Sanktionen künftig stärker im Innenministerium gebündelt, fügt Plate hinzu. Seiner Meinung nach ist dies ein „weiterer Schritt hin zu einer politischen Zentralisierung der Cybersicherheitsarchitektur.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der eco-Experte monierte zudem, „dass zwar die Rolle des BSI gestärkt wurde, die Bedeutung und der Stellenwert einer BSI-Zertifizierung für die Wirtschaft aber weiterhin schwer einschätzbar bleiben, weil sie unter dem Vorbehalt politischer Entscheidungen stünden.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der beschlossene Gesetzentwurf wurde auch in der Security-Szene scharf kritisiert. Nach Ansicht des Sicherheitsexperten Christoph Ebeling grenzt der Beschluss an „einen politischen Skandal.“ Der DevSecOps-Spezialist schimpfte in einem &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christoph-ebeling_was-heute-nachmittag-im-bundestag-beschlossen-activity-7394747958002405376-vxiu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LinkedIn-Post&lt;/a&gt;: „Der EU-Entwurf wurde im parlamentarischen Verfahren weiter entkernt, an entscheidenden Stellen sogar verwässert. Dass ausgerechnet die Pflicht zu einem funktionierenden Schwachstellenmanagement – dem Kern moderner Cybersicherheit – fast vollständig gestrichen wurde, ist Realsatire.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Arista, Palo Alto bolster AI data center security</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090217/arista-palo-alto-bolster-ai-data-center-security-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/4085193/arista-shares-q3-financials-touts-golden-era-in-networking.html"&gt;Arista Networks&lt;/a&gt; and Palo Alto Networks have extended their partnership to offer customers a framework for implementing zero-trust security inside the data center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new framework is intended to offer customers a way to blend networking control and management activities with security policies to allow integrated automation and consistent enforcement across the enterprise. In the past, Arista and Palo Alto worked together to share information but acted on it separately, and customers basically had to do any integration on their own, the vendors stated. That changes with the new agreement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DevOps teams build and update apps automatically using continuous integration/continuous delivery and other methods, and to keep those apps running smoothly as usage grows, they need systems that can automatically add resources and coordinate them&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;including when it requires orchestration across cloud environments, according to Kumar Srikantan, vice president and general manager, campus, at Arista, and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-barbieri-61b6121/"&gt;Alessandro Barbieri&lt;/a&gt;, director of product management at Arista.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This demand for agility and geo-distributed scale compounds the already profound security challenges stemming from the sheer scale of east-west traffic, which dramatically expands the attack surface. To exacerbate these issues, a new breed of AI-powered threats, where adversaries are leveraging AI to launch highly evasive attacks with a new level of sophistication and scale, significantly raises the impact of any security incident,” Srikanta and Barbieri wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.arista.com/blog/arista-and-palo-alto-networks-strengthen-partnership-in-the-new-age-of-ai-security"&gt;blog about the partnership&lt;/a&gt;. “Furthermore, AI-powered attacks are designed to slip past legacy defenses at increased speeds. Data exfiltration attacks, vulnerability exploits, or the development of ransomware that used to take weeks or days can now take hours or minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the expanded partnership, Arista and Palo Alto intend to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first of four key features is zero-trust segmentation for data centers, which unifies segmentation, visibility and inter-zone protection via Palo Alto’s next-generation firewall (NGFW) and &lt;a href="https://technologypartners.paloaltonetworks.com/English/integration/NGFW-Panorama-Arista-Multi-Domain-Segmentation-Services"&gt;Arista’s Multi-Domain Segmentation Services (MSS) fabric&lt;/a&gt;. With this feature, the Arista fabric, which has complete network visibility, intelligently steers east-west application traffic to the Palo Alto’s NGFW for deep, Layer 7 inspection, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/network-security/palo-alto-networks-arista-networks-partnership/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; by Srini Kotamraju, vice president of products at Palo Alto. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Based on this inspection, the NGFW creates a comprehensive, application-aware security policy. It then instructs the Arista fabric to enforce that policy at wire speed for all subsequent, similar flows,” Kotamraju wrote. “This ‘inspect-once, enforce-many’ model delivers granular zero trust security without the performance bottlenecks of hairpinning all traffic through a firewall or forcing a costly, disruptive network redesign.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second capability is a dynamic quarantine feature that enables the Palo Alto NGFWs to identify evasive threats using Cloud-Delivered Security Services (CDSS). “These services, such as Advanced WildFire for zero-day malware and Advanced Threat Prevention for unknown exploits, leverage global threat intelligence to detect and block attacks that traditional security misses,” Kotamraju wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Arista fabric can intelligently offload trusted, high-bandwidth “elephant flows” from the firewall after inspection, freeing it to focus on high-risk traffic. When a threat is detected, the NGFW signals &lt;a href="https://www.wwt.com/blog/segmentation-in-the-data-center-with-arista-cloudvision"&gt;Arista CloudVision&lt;/a&gt;, which programs the network switches to automatically quarantine the compromised workload at hardware line-rate, according to Kotamraju: “This immediate response halts the lateral spread of a threat without creating a performance bottleneck or requiring manual intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third feature is unified policy orchestration, where Palo Alto Networks’ management plane centralizes zone-based and microperimeter policies, and CloudVision MSS responds with the offload and enforcement of Arista switches. “This treats the entire geo-distributed network as a single logical switch, allowing workloads to be migrated freely across cloud networks and security domains,” Srikanta and Barbieri wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Arista Validated Design (AVD) data models enable network-as-a-code, integrating with CI/CD pipelines. AVDs can also be generated by Arista’s AVA (Autonomous Virtual Assist) AI agents that incorporate best practices, testing, guardrails, and generated configurations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our integration directly resolves this conflict by creating a clean architectural separation that decouples the network fabric from security policy. This allows the NetOps team (managing the Arista fabric) and the SecOps team (managing Palo Alto Networks security) to scale, upgrade, and innovate independently,” Kotamraju wrote. “NetOps can focus on building a high-performance, reliable network, while SecOps can focus on delivering best-in-class security services. Each team uses their own domain-specific management tools, and the integration layer automatically synchronizes policy and enforcement actions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arista works with a number of security vendors such as Fortinet, Check Point, Splunk and more but none are as deeply integrated as Palo Alto is now. The networking vendor, too, offers its own security packages, including &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3844364/arista-delivers-intelligent-load-balancing-ai-job-centric-observability.html"&gt;CloudVision&lt;/a&gt; MSS and its AI-driven network detection and response platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story, &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/4089591/arista-palo-alto-bolster-ai-data-center-security.html"&gt;Arista, Palo Alto bolster AI data center security&lt;/a&gt;, first appeared on Network World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://jadserve.postrelease.com/trk?ntv_at=3&amp;amp;ntv_ui=4ff90e77-fd76-4194-a092-c7866a9117ea&amp;amp;ntv_a=OyYKA1pJ1A5hUTA&amp;amp;ntv_fl=xuah4cVa_584s46je--NqC9BWmgOyoxkjkQhKZkBdwB6gFKddtkl8GJPaA3jDqv56vR2RspV_4uy1xLsb7gYYTRu_3OrnygvJ-BsX2fweIg6Pqyj9ADbHW9gzBYGtZHm5-9AZivoYGPxzVR0n1o_TJtslaRnWXaF7MpjfJNpKusYv7H-_4sHQJ68StYvTgqfDlAwClsqeJh4cUReq9ifdxwX4_v28Jtb2KkyPMTnxya3GRfQ442KuWqwTQKWl0L8XKr5EygVMSUW8h6uyjUO-uQswuiFQtTDis8KU62BI1UCpfEOt4r-0TxShDE25XjMcXaEFXqdsFi2se69sT2ggISHG_pC1Gn_ACUZBtB1JkvdvSNHN5iN3SPyZQhnh9FkpBMNqqWernKLoq52x9C_8_ythy83Y5BOIdcVW6my8fxpnLNW6cY6LWhrhMTilCkkqW_dMNmBPzzWrXKEC2e7v77x9Wry_kn4vZEBYZ2dH_5tClREzHHKEsfcDKM48tlkN44gxkNF4kxVXOVdDK9n68spYvRqHnD7Zr2y6X2_S4b1FrYVy06f5XD7zxYz-1WSNg7BHCjV0HIiVnOdSCIbYImK93S-ms406oHZOlLt0VpS2Vz97pgu1jYAv6OWi9hAyMCTsqEBiWQcHBeYABEJzQjVjrDMUwBToRhbQVsHZpz5JuO9NIY6dTsAvw58WV6JQ5JbkXy0-UyMzSufdUXDFIIPTRckgBgejUAXLdP9a-Ylb7oebN2uhJYmDCjuS4QeOihR1KGiyD4T9T9puXoyR6opOyD-O_G6pF9AQPbEWuLir3rBHVrYA2FZMV7cpzqjMyNN8NNXKIu3DEishIDzKD2bVXdhQu5IhBEwERcFx3AL7UPFbkOExWaMFtC0Yj-CwiMQAW6xLQFeAy6phBja_Ku3hroKWK7dN8EltiANTFKPKSzK6d1aJBBBB1R1tcuVNga4c_QO0X33TIVHEW3CZ1GVE_BIHOe--xRtLxk_kOyEgorQTQEpN9DJd_2jDrtBXLMd6uEX5gQlEaffsAOlsl2OqOpAVdT0pxCWTjil03VHUkvvLh9qr1ehX_ELqoYqv4kHd-SK-kAMtnicAwOnHgMNQ0G31n6KdGN2krPFv3uAYVh65d8Ol21Ukmm6ulAmamEQGnOMaizgxEF8NkQr0bJmkRZlTJBNFuzpfPCDF0KOEcWMWZBeqIVX2LpIt47OJLzbC52Y3xe0soGMV59DfhNRevSBjgz218Aw9utYe71JKycIhoQneZhBNFT3l1zQw6RW3I_kG3mMeGkJ6S9fG0dhHqSsK4PZRFNUQ-SBhKGetegyGDenbuFVmfIuqNmpVHKLYEgtlB1IyUlNo9YQs6V2Y9RQx-2J3a3NHtvdSgHpBidWUhnpEg4-fcuV1byM&amp;amp;ord=-2104644366&amp;amp;ntv_ht=BEcXaQA&amp;amp;ntv_tad=16&amp;amp;prx_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;amp;ntv_r=https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/perspectives/we-have-entered-the-big-game-hunting-era-of-ransomware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How shadow IT leaves every industry in the dark</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086912/how-shadow-it-leaves-every-industry-in-the-dark.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shadow IT is everywhere. What began with employees or departments bringing familiar tools such as personal email or file-sharing apps into the workplace has grown into unauthorized software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence (AI). With just a few clicks, these tools become part of daily workflows. But they also create significant operational risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, Shadow IT is any software, hardware, or resource introduced on a network without approval through official IT, procurement, or compliance processes. This includes personal cloud storage, client-run applications, unofficial chat tools, unapproved unified-communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) solutions, or bring-your-own-device (BYOD) practices. It can also stem from rapid technology changes, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/575483/cloud-misconfiguration-causes-massive-data-breach-at-toyota-motor.html?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" target="_blank"&gt;overlooked systems&lt;/a&gt;, technical debt, or business teams developing apps and portals outside formal oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/cloud/the-shadow-it-dilemma?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;up to 80% of employees adopt Shadow IT&lt;/a&gt; because they believe preferred software helps them work more efficiently than sanctioned resources. Now that same pattern is emerging in a new form: Shadow AI—the use of unsanctioned generative AI (GenAI) tools for writing, analysis, and automation that further expand the attack surface and reduce visibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-high-cost-of-casting-shadows"&gt;The high cost of casting shadows&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data breaches involving Shadow AI cost an average of $670,000 more than other security incidents, according to IBM’s &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2025 “Cost of a Data Breach Report&lt;/a&gt;,” which also found that 20% of all breaches stemmed from unauthorized AI use. These risks, including regulatory penalties and loss of intellectual property, play out differently across industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-dark-side-of-shadow-systems"&gt;The dark side of shadow systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shadow IT is really about consequences. Compliance and privacy are among the most pressing. Regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) require strict oversight of sensitive data. Unapproved applications may bypass these safeguards, exposing organizations to fines or legal action even if no data breach occurs. Security is another concern. Assets outside IT oversight go unmonitored, leaving vulnerabilities and misconfigurations open to attack. Independent research shows just how big the problem is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IDC’s “&lt;a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US50614724?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Future of Digital Infrastructure: The Future of Digital Infrastructure, 2024: AI-Ready Platforms, Operating Models, and Governance&lt;/a&gt;” found that more than 40% of SaaS applications operate without formal IT approval, creating blind spots that directly undermine compliance requirements. Similarly, the IEEE Computer Society reported that &lt;a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/trends/shadow-it-in-2024?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;41% of employees already acquire or build technology outside IT’s knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, with that share projected to rise to 75% by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unauthorized systems rarely integrate well with official tools, creating silos, duplicate data, and broken workflows. With SaaS and AI adoption accelerating, these risks are spreading faster than IT teams can manage. Eliminating Shadow IT and its cousin Shadow AI isn’t realistic, so the focus must shift from prevention to smarter control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="exposing-whats-outside-its-view"&gt;Exposing what’s outside IT’s view&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regaining control begins with visibility. Teams need to see what’s moving across the network, including live activity, unauthorized apps, and new risks. By analyzing network traffic in real time, NETSCOUT gives IT and security teams the insight to uncover Shadow IT and Shadow AI, close compliance gaps early, and keep sensitive data out of unapproved systems, bringing a hidden problem into the light.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why network visibility is the thread that holds cybersecurity together</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086813/why-network-visibility-is-the-thread-that-holds-cybersecurity-together.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every organization is chasing the same thing in security: speed, clarity, and confidence. But in reality, most are bogged down by complexity, siloed tools, and an overwhelming flood of alerts. The latest research from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) illustrates this tension clearly, and the numbers tell a story every security leader can relate to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-problem-complexity-and-delay"&gt;The problem: Complexity and delay&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/resources/ebooks/esg-report-visibility-in-protecting-modern-environments?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to ESG’s research&lt;/a&gt;, the most commonly cited challenge for security teams today isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/malware?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; or phishing. It’s complexity. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of organizations say environmental complexity is their biggest barrier to effective detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the consequence of that complexity is time. More than half (55%) admit it takes hours, sometimes longer, just to validate if an alert is a true positive. That’s hours attackers get to &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-mitre-attack/lateral-movement?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;move laterally&lt;/a&gt;, establish &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-mitre-attack/persistence?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;persistence&lt;/a&gt;, and blend in with normal traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-common-ground-the-network-as-source-of-truth"&gt;The common ground: The network as source of truth&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So where do organizations turn when environments get too complex and alerts feel untrustworthy? To the one thing every attack must cross: the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forty-one percent of security leaders say &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/ndr?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;network detection and response&lt;/a&gt; tools are the best equipped to provide visibility across hybrid, multicloud environments. That’s because packets don’t care where they’re traveling: on-prem, across a data center, or in the cloud. They tell the whole story without bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more telling: 93% of organizations report that their SecOps and NetOps teams now share the same network visibility tools and data. In an era where silos slow response, the network has quietly become the common language of security and operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-turning-point-investigation-over-detection"&gt;The turning point: Investigation over detection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detection has been the industry obsession for years. But detection is only step one. The real battle is in investigation: understanding the scope, root cause, and impact of a threat quickly enough to act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why 98% of organizations say network visibility helps with the analysis and investigation phase, with 61% calling the impact “significant.” It’s not just about spotting something suspicious. It’s about turning that suspicion into certainty so teams can move faster and with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No wonder the top use case for network visibility, cited by 45% of organizations, is accelerating incident response processes. It’s not the alert that matters most. It’s what you can do with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-enabler-continuous-packet-capture"&gt;The enabler: Continuous packet capture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The secret behind this efficiency? Continuous &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/packet-capture?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;packet capture&lt;/a&gt;. Respondents to the ESG survey overwhelmingly agree that it provides more accurate detections, deeper visibility, and better collaboration between SecOps and NetOps. It means there’s always a record to go back to, always context to support an investigation, and always a single source of truth to end the “he said, she said” between tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-reality-security-leaders-are-betting-big-on-visibility"&gt;The reality: Security leaders are betting big on visibility&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why this isn’t just theory. Nearly all organizations (91%) say they expect to increase spending on network visibility. In an era of shrinking budgets, that kind of consensus is rare. But when something makes security faster, clearer, and more collaborative, it earns its place as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-this-matters"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you pull these threads together, a picture emerges:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complexity is the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Time is the cost.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The network is the answer.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And investigation, not just detection, is where the real impact lies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At NETSCOUT, we believe this shift in mindset is long overdue. With &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI)&lt;/a&gt;, we deliver continuous, alert-independent packet-level visibility that allows teams to unify, investigate with confidence, and reduce the time attackers have in your environment.

      <title>Why SOC efficiency is the most valuable currency in cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086904/why-soc-efficiency-is-the-most-valuable-currency-in-cybersecurity.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In cybersecurity, time is scarce, talent is scarce, and certainty is scarce. That’s why efficiency has quietly become the most valuable currency inside the &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/soc?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;security operations center (SOC)&lt;/a&gt;. Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) research found that 53% of organizations say &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/ndr?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;network detection and response (NDR)&lt;/a&gt; has helped improve SOC analyst efficiency. That might sound like a soft metric, until you consider the reality facing most teams: a global cybersecurity skills shortage, unrelenting alert volume, and increasingly complex environments. In that context, efficiency isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="efficiency-is-about-focus-not-speed"&gt;Efficiency is about focus, not speed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When people hear “efficiency,” they often think of doing things faster. But inside the SOC, efficiency is about focus. It’s about giving analysts the ability to spend less time chasing false positives and more time investigating the alerts that matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/resources/ebooks/esg-report-visibility-in-protecting-modern-environments?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The ESG study&lt;/a&gt; highlights that network visibility delivers this focus by providing analysts with tamper-proof, end-to-end data that eliminates blind spots. Instead of toggling between incomplete logs or uncertain endpoint data, analysts can turn to the network—the one place every threat must travel. That clarity reduces wasted motion and frees up scarce human talent for higher-value work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="packets-as-a-force-multiplier"&gt;Packets as a force multiplier&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think of packet visibility as a force multiplier. A junior analyst, armed with raw alerts, might take hours to piece together an investigation. But with packet-level context, knowing exactly what was communicated, when, and to where, that same analyst can validate and scope an incident in minutes.  That’s not just faster. It’s transformative. It’s how organizations under pressure from the talent gap continue to hold the line against increasingly sophisticated threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-efficiency-to-impact"&gt;From efficiency to impact&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where NETSCOUT’s &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Omnis Cyber Intelligence (OCI)&lt;/a&gt; comes in. By delivering continuous &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/packet-capture?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;packet capture&lt;/a&gt; and full-fidelity visibility across hybrid environments, Omnis Cyber Intelligence helps SOC teams move beyond raw detection into confident investigation. The result: Analysts of all skill levels can operate more effectively, collaboration between SecOps and NetOps is seamless, and precious human resources are maximized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because at the end of the day, efficiency in the SOC isn’t about cutting corners. It’s about cutting through the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From detection to response: Why confidence is the real game changer</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086908/from-detection-to-response-why-confidence-is-the-real-game-changer.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity often feels like a race where you don’t know when the starting gun will fire. The moment a threat slips past the perimeter, the countdown begins. Every minute between “we detected something” and “we know what to do about it” is time the attacker spends with free rein inside your environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/resources/ebooks/esg-report-visibility-in-protecting-modern-environments?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) research&lt;/a&gt;, 98% of organizations say network visibility helps them move from detection to response faster, and with more confidence. That last word is key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="speed-without-confidence-is-panic"&gt;Speed without confidence is panic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine your smoke alarm goes off in the middle of the night. You can run around the house in a panic, or you can grab a flashlight and see exactly where the smoke is coming from. The difference isn’t speed, it’s clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s how most security operations center (SOC) teams feel when they’re drowning in alerts. Detection tells you something happened. But investigation, powered by network visibility, tells you what it was, how far it spread, and how to stop it. Without that confidence, speed becomes chaos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-network-visibility-is-the-flashlight"&gt;Why network visibility is the flashlight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ESG study makes this clear: Network visibility isn’t just another layer of detection. It’s the lens that turns noise into knowledge. &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/packet?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Packets&lt;/a&gt; capture everything attackers do—every beacon, every &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-mitre-attack/lateral-movement?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lateral move&lt;/a&gt;, every &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-mitre-attack/exfiltration?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exfiltration&lt;/a&gt; attempt. That means analysts can quickly validate alerts, scope exposure, and move with precision when minutes matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And contrary to the outdated perception of network tools as “on-prem only,” ESG found that organizations trust them to deliver across today’s hybrid, multicloud environments. Visibility has evolved, and it’s more critical than ever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="detection-is-the-alarm-investigation-is-the-response"&gt;Detection is the alarm, investigation is the response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At NETSCOUT, we believe detection is only the starting point. The real battle is won in understanding a threat via investigation, shrinking the time from suspicion to certainty. NETSCOUT &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/product/cyber-intelligence?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Omnis Cyber Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; delivers the scalable, packet-level visibility that unifies SecOps and NetOps, eliminates blind spots, and gives analysts the clarity they need to act with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because in security, speed matters. But speed without confidence is just wasted motion.&lt;/p&gt;
