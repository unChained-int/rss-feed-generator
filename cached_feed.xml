      <title>Lazarus group targets European drone makers in new espionage campaign</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4078672/lazarus-group-targets-european-drone-makers-in-new-espionage-campaign.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity researchers from ESET have identified a new Lazarus Group campaign targeting European defense contractors, particularly those involved in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to ESET findings, the threat actors used fake job offers and trojanized open-source software, as is customary in their Operation Dreamjob campaigns, to infiltrate their targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some of these are heavily involved in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sector, suggesting that the operation may be linked to North Korea’s current efforts to scale up its drone program,” ESET researchers said in a blog post about the European firms targeted. The activity, observed since March 2025, marks another phase of Lazarus’ long-running espionage&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/657312/north-koreas-state-hacking-program-is-varied-fluid-and-nimble.html" target="_blank"&gt; operations&lt;/a&gt; that align closely with North Korea’s strategic military objectives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Operation Dreamjob is a series of campaigns where the Lazarus group &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3818521/lazarus-group-tricks-job-seekers-on-linkedin-with-crypto-stealer.html"&gt;poses as recruiters&lt;/a&gt; from well-known aerospace and defense firms and deploys malicious payloads to gain persistence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Attack chain built around fake job offers and tampered software&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial compromise begins with spear-phishing messages posing as job opportunities from reputable defense companies. These messages deliver malicious files disguised as PDF readers or installation packages. When executed, they load additional components through &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4038967/new-ransomware-charon-uses-dll-sideloading-to-breach-critical-infrastructure.html"&gt;DLL side-loading&lt;/a&gt;, a tactic Lazarus has used in several previous operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this campaign, ESET observed the use of “DroneEXEHijackingLoader.dll,” a loader specifically crafted to exploit legitimate executables, which then delivered “ScoringMathTea,” a custom remote-access trojan (RAT) used by the group for command execution, data exfiltration, and persistence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack also leveraged trojanized versions of open-source software such as WinMerge and Notepad++, embedding loaders and droppers into otherwise benign tools. “The attackers decided to incorporate their malicious loading routines into open-source projects available on GitHub,” the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/gotta-fly-lazarus-targets-uav-sector/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “The choice of project varies from one attack to another.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While ScoringMathTea is the primary payload used in this UAV-focused campaign, ESET noted that Lazarus has, in past operations, frequently used LightlessCan and related families, including ImprudentCook, BlindingCan, miniBlindingCan, and SimplexTea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Drone-component theft meets geopolitical ambition&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The targeting of firms linked to UAV design and manufacture is no coincidence. At least two of the companies compromised were tied to critical drone component supply chains and software systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The in-the-wild attacks successively targeted three European companies active in the defense sector,” researchers added. “Although their activities are somewhat diverse, these entities can be described as a metal engineering company (Southeastern Europe), a manufacturer of aircraft components (Central Europe), and a defense company (Central Europe).”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, imagery and reports indicate that North Korea is actively pursuing its own drone manufacturing capability–Saetbyol-4 and Saetboyl-9 models which bear more than a passing resemblance to US equivalents, the blog noted. The theft of design data, manufacturing process know-how, and supply chain intelligence could accelerate Pyongyang’s UAV push. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ESET has provided downloadable IoCs (SHA-1 hashes, C2 domains, and IPs) and a GitHub repo with the full artifact set and mapped the campaign to MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK techniques such as DLL side-loading (T1574.002), user execution (T1204.002), reflective code loading (T1620), process injection (T1055), and web protocol C2 (T1071.001). According to ESET researchers, defenders in the aerospace and UAV supply chain should ingest these IoCs, tune detections for the listed TTPs, and apply the containment and hunting steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>UN agreement on cybercrime criticized over risks to cybersecurity researchers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4078735/un-agreement-on-cybercrime-criticized-over-risks-to-cybersecurity-researchers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity researchers could face criminal charges for performing their legitimate work if the &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/cybercrime/convention/text/convention-full-text.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;United Nations Convention against Cybercrime&lt;/a&gt; is ratified in a process beginning in Hanoi, Vietnam, this weekend, critics say.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tech industry group &lt;a href="https://cybertechaccord.org/signatories/"&gt;Cybersecurity Tech Accord&lt;/a&gt; said today that little has changed since it presented &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/Cybercrime/AdHocCommittee/Concluding_session/Submissions/Multi-Stakeholders/Cybersecurity_Tech_Accord_-_7th_AHC_session_submission.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a detailed critique of the UN Convention against Cybercrime&lt;/a&gt; more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group, comprising tech heavyweights Arm, Cisco, Cloudflare, Dell, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, and over 100 others, warned that the convention opens the door to criminalization of legitimate online activities, as well as making fighting cybercrime more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Accord said the Convention had an unclear and overly broad scope, vague criminalization provisions, missing protections for cybersecurity researchers, unnecessarily expansive data access provisions, and intrusive surveillance powers with no meaningful safeguards to protect individuals and victims of cybercrime from arbitrary abuse of executive authority. “As a result,” it said, “the latest draft reads more like a UN digital surveillance treaty than a targeted instrument to fight cybercrime.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, it urged UN member-states not to ratify the Convention when the process begins this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-researchers-at-risk"&gt;Security researchers at risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Watch, an organization that investigates and reports on abuses worldwide, is also opposed to the Convention. In a &lt;a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/30/new-un-cybercrime-treaty-primed-abuse" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post shortly after the UN adopted the Convention&lt;/a&gt;, it said that the treaty extends far beyond cybercrime to require states to establish “broad electronic surveillance powers” without adequate human rights safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The convention will obligate governments to collect electronic evidence and share it with foreign authorities for any ‘serious crime,’ defined as an offense punishable by at least four years of imprisonment under domestic law,” wrote Deputy Director, Technology, Rights &amp;amp; Investigations, Deborah Brown, noting that many governments treat activities such as investigative journalism and the ordinary activities of security researchers as criminal offenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Research Center is one of numerous other groups warning against the Convention. “The poor drafting of the UN Cybercrime Treaty demonstrates that a minimum threshold for activities constituting a cybercrime has not been established, illustrating a problematic line that Member States need to walk in upholding national and international justice,” it warned &lt;a href="https://www.humanrightsresearch.org/post/the-un-cybercrime-treaty-a-pandora-s-box-for-human-rights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a March 2025 post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/valence-howden" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Valence Howden&lt;/a&gt;, an advisory fellow at Info-Tech Research Group, said that the Convention had improved during the drafting process, particularly around the definition of what actions constitute cybercrimes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The current text of the agreement focused a lot more on ensuring that the action was taken with the intent to be malicious, so I see a lot of value in this moving forward,” he said. “I don’t believe it’s perfect, and we may need a bit more explicit protection for individuals who aren’t doing things with malicious intent. However, I believe the urge to make it hyper-specific will also allow nitpicking that will work to prevent this from moving forward at all. That approach favors the powerful companies and protects potential criminality on their part in accessing and leveraging data for AI.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, he added, “We need to see and understand the signatories and understand how they implement, because there is flexibility (read as vagueness) in the treaty. Much like global standards, it has to allow for flexibility to account for the variable approaches of different countries and regions. I suspect the debate that it’s driven by is beneficial as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Beauceron Security, also applauded facets of the Convention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The good news here is that after five long years of negotiation, certain basics like making sure countries that sign on and ratify this treaty all have criminal laws on the books for various digital crimes consistently is a huge win,” he said, recalling a case he assisted in where the perpetrator of a series of non-consensual intimate image distributions fled the country to a region where the act was not considered a crime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In this scenario, if this convention was in effect, if the country the suspect had fled to had signed on, they would have been required to treat what happened as a crime and hopefully would have cooperated in the investigatation and prosecution of the perpetrator,” he said. “And the victim may have had some measure of justice. Instead, they were left only with the trauma of what happened to them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is pleased that the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071954/eu-to-sign-un-convention-on-cybercrime.html"&gt;European Union has decided to support the treaty&lt;/a&gt;, since it takes cybercrime seriously while still protecting the fundamental privacy and human rights of its citizens. However, he noted, “I think the key here is to remember each member state has to not just sign on, but has to ratify this treaty in their government and pass or amend laws as required. This is going to take quite some time. As well, nothing in this treaty compromises the judicial or policing processes, so if an authoritarian regime attempts to abuse this convention, western liberal democracies with strong foundations in the rule of law will have checks and balances.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="better-budapest-than-hanoi"&gt;Better Budapest than Hanoi?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord’s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashtonhart/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Ashton-Hart&lt;/a&gt;, who headed the group’s delegation to the UN committee creating the treaty, said that rather than implementing the Convention against Cybercrime, UN member states should look to another agreement: the Council of Europe’s &lt;a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Budapest Convention&lt;/a&gt;. It, he said, “is a much better agreement that is already in force with a critical mass of member-states as parties, a growing list of states who want to join it,  a proven track record, and extensive guidance in how to address the Convention in a rights respecting way.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added, “I expect that the private sector will continue to focus its efforts on capacity building and technical assistance for Budapest and won’t prioritize the UN Convention – unless the protocol negotiations [described in Articles 61 and 62 of the Convention] address its problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these problems, Shipley thinks that the industry should now focus on proper implementation of the Convention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I understand the concerns that the cybersecurity industry has raised,” he said. “They’re not at the idea of greater cooperation in taking down gangs. They’re aimed at the conventions ambiguous language around unauthorized access and the potential for security researchers to be caught in the crosshairs for doing ethical research. But that ship has sailed and we’d be better off ensuring the application of the convention within states that choose to sign on, does include robust protections for security research.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Convention will come into force 90 days after it has been ratified by 40 member states or regional economic integration organizations; the ratification process extends until December 31, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>
