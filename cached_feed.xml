      <title>Five central suspects arrested in whole-sale cocaine trafficking case</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/five-central-suspects-arrested-in-whole-sale-cocaine-trafficking-case</link>
      <description>Between 1 and 2 October, the Colombian Police (Policia Nacional de Colombia) and the Spanish Guardia Civil, supported by Europol, targeted five key suspects, linked to the so-called Clan del Golfo, allegedly responsible for whole-sale cocaine trafficking operations from South America to Europe. In particular, the criminal network oversaw first-hand the production, transportation and distribution of cocaine throughout the entire logistics chains. To support field activities on the action day, Europol deployed two experts to Colombia and Spain.</description>

      <title>US NSA alleged to have launched a cyber attack on a Chinese agency</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4075846/us-nsa-alleged-to-have-launched-a-cyber-attack-on-a-chinese-agency.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China’s claim that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was behind a cyber attack against the country’s timekeeping centre could be true, says an expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From a technical perspective, China’s allegation about an NSA hack on its national timekeeping center is plausible and aligns with known US cyber capabilities,”  &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/profile/jeff-bardin/" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Bardin&lt;/a&gt;, chief intelligence officer at US-based Treadstone 71, told CSO on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, he added, “without public evidence it’s hard to confirm conclusively.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was commenting on a &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZtKjlaIoMVCSY-rXt2RP1Q" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post last week on WeChat&lt;/a&gt; from China’s Ministry of National Security saying, “national security authorities uncovered a major cyber attack case in the United States and obtained irrefutable evidence that the National Security Agency launched a cyber attack and invaded China’s National Time Service Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public affairs section of China’s Washington, D.C. embassy confirmed to CSO that the post “is from China’s security authorities.” The allegation&lt;a href="https://x.com/ChineseEmbinUS" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; is also repeated on the Chinese embassy’s X feed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timekeeping center “provides high-precision timing services to the nation’s communications, finance, power, transportation, surveying and mapping, defense, and other sectors, and provides crucial data support for the calculation of international standard time,” the post says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cyber attack “would impact the secure and stable operation of ‘Beijing Time,’” says the post, referring to the country’s single time zone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attack, the post says, would lead “to serious consequences such as network communication failures, financial system disruptions, power outages, transportation disruptions, and space launch failures. It could even cause chaos in international time, resulting in incalculable damage and losses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="allegedly-took-advantage-of-sms-vulnerability"&gt;Allegedly took advantage of SMS vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WeChat post alleges that, starting on March 25, 2022, “the NSA exploited a vulnerability in the SMS service of an overseas mobile phone brand to covertly attack and gain control of the mobile phones of multiple NSC staff members, stealing sensitive data stored within them.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, an NSA spokesperson sent this reply by email: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;NSA does not confirm nor deny allegations in the media regarding its operations. Our core focus is countering foreign malign activities persistently targeting American interests, and we will continue to defend against adversaries wishing to threaten us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chinese post says the country “shattered the US cyber attack plot of stealing secrets and infiltration and sabotage, and made every effort to protect the security of ‘Beijing Time.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="possible-serious-escalation"&gt;Possible ‘serious escalation’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the recent Chinese claim against the NSA is true, said Bardin, it suggests a strategic intent by the US not just to spy, but to position the country to potentially disrupt a core piece of Chinese infrastructure — the timing system underpinning communications, finance, energy, and defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That, he said, “would mark a serious escalation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s also striking,” he added, “that Beijing went public with this claim, since China typically avoids admitting breaches of its own critical systems. China’s public accusation signals a bid to sway international opinion, painting the US as a global ‘hacker empire’ and rallying other nations behind calls to rein in state-sponsored cyber intrusions. Beijing is expected to bolster its cyber defenses and could even hint at tit-for-tat moves against US timekeeping networks to deter further incursions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Economically, he added, “the incident continues China’s push for tech self-reliance – tightening supply chains and fast-tracking homegrown alternatives (such as sovereign timing systems) – as it seeks to reduce exposure to US tech influence amid already high trade and technology tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The Chinese allegation also fits with the pattern of behavior from Beijing “leaning forward with public attribution of what they consider malicious cyber activity … and oftentimes that attribution is not necessarily accurate,” said Matthew Ferren, international affairs fellow in national security at the US Council on Foreign Relations. In fact, he couldn’t say whether there was an attack or an intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This tells me nothing about what may or may not have happened in the real world, but it does fit within the pattern of behavior of the Chinese to shape narratives around the United States being an irresponsible actor in the cyber domain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advice-for-cisos"&gt;Advice for CISOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time services are an interesting and often overlooked target, said Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Institute, because many authentication protocols rely on accurate time services. To prevent replay of old attestations, these systems require synchronized times. If the times are not synchronized, messages from authentication servers will be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simplest result of a compromised time service is a denial of service attack. Or, he added, it can lead to bypassing some authentication or access control checks, or the ability to replay old authentication messages to gain access to systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CISOs should not neglect these time services,” he said in an email. “It is too easy to leave them in a default configuration which often uses undefined open cloud based time server pools. Instead, internal time servers should be defined to serve as an internal standard, and these internal time standards need to be synchronized with carefully selected sources like GPS or time servers run by a trusted entity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treadstone 71’s Bardin said that CSOs in any country who want to protect themselves from a sophisticated nation-state attacker should treat time infrastructure linked to their servers as a national-level dependency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Segment and isolate all systems relying on NTP (network time protocol) or GPS sources, verify clock integrity against multiple independent references and deploy cryptographic attestation for time signals, he advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also recommends disabling SMS-based login authentication for privileged access, enforcing out-of-band multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring for anomalies in timing drift or certificate use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that red team drills simulating loss of trusted time, which will validate IT operational resilience, is also worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To assist defenders, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers this advice&lt;/a&gt; to organizations to help protect themselves from nation-state attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>CISOs’ security priorities reveal an augmented cyber agenda</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074969/cisos-security-priorities-reveal-an-augmented-cyber-agenda.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology may be changing rapidly but one thing remains constant: It’s not an easy time to be a CSO. The role continues to evolve with security leaders &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3851735/cisos-are-taking-on-ever-more-responsibilities-and-functional-roles-has-it-gone-too-far.html"&gt;taking on even more responsibilities&lt;/a&gt;, and 76% reporting that understanding which security solutions best fit their company has grown more complex, according to CSO’s 2025 Security Priorities Study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, 57% of respondents report their organization has struggled to find the root cause of security incidents they experienced in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These days, security leaders find themselves tasked with a range of high-level responsibilities, including cyber strategy and policy development, risk management, and managing the risks of AI-enabled technology. Moreover, 67% of security leaders say their responsibilities require them to address security issues outside their country or region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holding them back are perennial problems: employee awareness training; lack of budget; retaining qualified employees; process complexity; and, increasingly, the ability to address the risks presented by disruptive technologies such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="protecting-data-continues-to-be-a-key-priority"&gt;Protecting data continues to be a key priority&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to CSO’s survey, security leaders have several key areas of focus, including strengthening protection of confidential and sensitive data (48%), securing cloud data and systems (45%), and simplifying IT security infrastructure (39%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 06 Key Priorities" class="wp-image-4074985" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/06-key-priorities-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharylewis1/"&gt;Zach Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, CIO and CISO of University of Health Sciences &amp;amp; Pharmacy in St. Louis, says &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;consolidating tools&lt;/a&gt; and using what they have more fully are his main priorities going into next year. “We’re moving more in the direction of platforms instead of best of breed to try and find some cost savings and simplify the tech stack,’’ Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the university’s data governance journey continues. “We have managed to classify and categorize our data,’’ he says. “Now we are locking that data into our retention period policy and cleaning up duplicate data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-plans-vary"&gt;AI plans vary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI continues to penetrate deeper into the enterprise, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042494/how-ai-is-reshaping-cybersecurity-operations.html"&gt;including the security operations center&lt;/a&gt;. Seventy-three percent of security decision-makers are more likely this year to consider a security solution that uses AI, up from 59% in 2024, and 58% plan to increase spending on AI-enabled security technology, according to the CSO survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nethealth.com/author/keavymurphy/"&gt;Keavy Murphy&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of security at Net Health, is giving considerable thought to AI’s impact and how the organization is going to navigate the technology heading into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This year, it became abundantly clear that AI isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s becoming more integral than ever, even in industries like healthcare that have historically been considered laggards,’’ Murphy says. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nethealth.com/lp/technology-strategies-for-reimbursement/"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of healthcare leaders Net Health participated in, 93% of respondents indicated their organizations are prioritizing AI adoption for clinical decision support in the next 12 to 24 months, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same survey revealed that confidence in AI is still forming, and adoption will depend on whether these tools demonstrate sufficient ROI, ease of use, and regulatory safety, Murphy notes. While she is “in full support of this level of AI adoption,” Murphy acknowledges that this “might be an unusual take from a cybersecurity expert, since many of us are wary of advanced technologies that might open us up to threat.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Murphy reasons that since “there’s no question that bad actors will be using AI and the most advanced software possible in their attacks,’’ organizations that are susceptible to these attacks, like hospitals or private practices, must respond with equally sophisticated tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think AI is an incredible innovation that can help healthcare organizations streamline so many of their day-to-day operations like documentation, administrative tasks, and more,’’ she explains. “It’s only right that we take advantage of it for cybersecurity purposes, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is already party of cyber risk planning at Aflac, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-callahan-4b39241/"&gt;Tim Callahan&lt;/a&gt;, global CISO, who expects its usage will only increase in 2026. Already, his team is leveraging AI and machine learning &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059116/6-novel-ways-to-use-ai-in-cybersecurity.html"&gt;for threat detection and response&lt;/a&gt; as well as malware identification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, AI is also helping us automate repetitive tasks, triage alerts, and prioritize vulnerabilities, but never at the expense of a hands-on approach where expert evaluation and intelligence is critical,’’ Callahan stresses. “As the world’s adversaries launch more sophisticated AI-driven attacks, it is critical that we use these technologies to not only keep pace but stay ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He says leadership is carefully evaluating AI’s role at Aflac and within the cybersecurity teams, “especially as regulatory frameworks adapt to new technologies.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis of University of Health Sciences &amp;amp; Pharmacy is not as gung-ho on AI, saying it will not play a significant role in his cyber risk planning. While things like phishing emails, video deepfakes, voice fakes, and fake images are a concern, “foundationally, a lot of things still hold,’’ he says. “I’m not pouring a ton of funding into that; just reinforcing those … security stack pieces that I already have in place and making sure that users are aware and that our systems are tuned properly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="concern-over-ai-enabled-attacks-rises"&gt;Concern over AI-enabled attacks rises&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Net Health’s Murphy, security buyers are concerned about AI-enabled cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, 38% of respondents expressed worry about AI-enabled ransomware, while security leaders also cited attackers leveraging AI to facilitate attack automation (35%) and an adversary’s use of AI to hunt for vulnerabilities in their enterprise (33%) as other top AI-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 21 AI-Enabled Concerns" class="wp-image-4074987" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21-AI-enabled-concerns-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_753808.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, 41% are planning to leverage AI to detect threats, for anomaly detection, and to automate security responses. Other respondents cited plans to leverage AI for malware detection and real-time risk prediction (39%), as well as DLP and improving enterprise system visibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, 40% expect to see AI enhancements as part of their existing security systems — without additional charges — while 32% are willing to pay a premium for AI-enabled security solutions that meet their specific security needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 24 AI Plans" class="wp-image-4074988" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24-ai-plans-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_ec4a7b.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-benefits-ai-security-tech-provides"&gt;The benefits AI security tech provides&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A whopping 99% of respondents have already seen benefits from the AI-enabled security technologies, up from 72% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the benefits: faster identification of unknown threats (44%), accelerated detection and response times (42%), the ability to sift through large amounts of data faster(42%), reduced employee workloads due to automation (42%), and the ability of to be more proactive (42%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tool-priorities-for-a-shifting-threat-landscape"&gt;Tool priorities for a shifting threat landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders report a wide range of tools in production, including solutions for authentication (36%), security awareness and training (35%), incident response (34%), DLP (33%), and EDR (32%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools on their radar include security analytics (28%), enterprise security management (27%), SIEM (26%), and data governance (26%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 16 Tools in Use" class="wp-image-4074989" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16-tools-in-use-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_c5352a.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aflac’s Callahan says his organization is prioritizing “highly evolved security tools.’’ For example, the company took a customized approach when &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3965399/security-leaders-shed-light-on-their-zero-trust-journeys.html"&gt;implementing zero trust&lt;/a&gt;, including access detection and blocking, he says. “This approach has helped us avoid mistakes and pitfalls that could impact our business,’’ Callahan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next year, the plan is to implement tools “that increase visibility and provide better automation and integration across our environment,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The University of Health Sciences &amp;amp; Pharmacy recently added a new DLP tool that is still in stealth mode, which “comes back to the AI concerns,’’ Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is also planning to consolidate a couple of tools focused on email security and utilizing Microsoft’s email gateway and other security pieces, since the university is a Microsoft shop. That will give him the ability to purchase the DLP system, “which is very important, as our data is now going into more AI systems,” he says. “I want to be sure I’m keeping an eye on that and making sure sensitive and proprietary data or research isn’t slipping away into these public LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="budgets-will-remain-relatively-unchanged"&gt;Budgets will remain relatively unchanged&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some 55% of respondents said their security budgets will remain the same, while 43% report expecting an increase, according to the Security Priorities survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis anticipates level funding next year, with a possible 1% increase, which is par for the course in higher ed, he says. “I will make do with the tools I have,’’ he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any increases to Callahan’s budget at Aflac “will be driven by the need to invest in advanced technologies, tactics to address emerging regulatory requirements, and the ongoing need for talent development,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents reported the main business priorities driving security spending to be: increasing cybersecurity protections (42%), increasing operational efficiency (37%), accelerating AI-driven innovation and applications (31%), improving profitability (30%), and transforming existing business processes such as automation and integration (30%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msps-retain-their-value-as-the-security-landscape-grows-more-complex"&gt;MSPs retain their value as the security landscape grows more complex&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another finding in this year’s survey is that 90% of respondents plan to outsource security functions to a managed services provider (MSP) or other third-party provider in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aflac has been utilizing managed security service providers (MSSPs) for years, particularly to provide 24/7 coverage, Callahan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2026, we will continue to expand our partnerships with third-party providers, though not to replace our core team, but rather to enhance our team’s outputs around strategic initiatives,’’ he says. “As the environment grows more complex, we expect to see additional support in areas such as vulnerability management and compliance.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis echoes that, saying the university will continue to use third-party providers to have 24/7 SOC coverage. His MSSP is also handling SIEM, logging events, and EDR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="csos-visibility-is-on-the-rise"&gt;CSOs’ visibility is on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As their responsibilities increase, security leaders are gaining the attention of their boards — 95% reported they engage with their board of directors, up from 85% in 2023. Forty-eight percent engage with their board multiple times a month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 70% of respondents report that someone on their organization’s board of directors has specific responsibility or oversight for cybersecurity, up from 59% in 2024. Seventy-two percent said engagement with their board has helped improve cybersecurity/security initiatives, up from 66% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 11 Boards" class="wp-image-4074990" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/11-boards-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_43a647.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis meets with the university’s board or audit committee almost quarterly, and he thinks that’s adequate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot of CISOs really think they need a seat at table,’’ which may be organization- or industry-specific, he says. But he believes security leaders ought to instead work on having a better relationship with their CEO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should be “working to secure things more internally than necessarily what’s happened externally, and having that relationship with the executive team [and] other functional leaders in the organization,’’ he says. That, Lewis adds, is “arguably more important than necessarily having a seat at the board table.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSO’s Security Priorities Report surveyed 641 respondents to gain a better understanding of the various security projects organizations are focused on now and in the coming year. The research also looked at issues that will demand the most time and strategic thinking for IT and security teams. Respondents came from North America (46%), APAC (36%), and EMEA (18%).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The average company size is 14,494 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cybercrime-as-a-service takedown: 7 arrested</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>AI-enabled ransomware attacks: CISO’s top security concern — with good reason</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4075912/ai-enabled-ransomware-attacks-cisos-top-security-concern-with-good-reason.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As ransomware attacks accelerate in speed and sophistication, 38% of security leaders rank AI-enabled ransomware as their top concern — the most frequently cited worry about AI-related security issues according to CSO’s new 2025 Security Priorities study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That concern appears to already be well founded, as a second study released today, &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/state-of-ransomware-survey/"&gt;CrowdStrike’s 2025 State of Ransomware Survey&lt;/a&gt;, provides a snapshot of how the ransomware threat is evolving, revealing cybersecurity pros’ fears surrounding the use of AI in ransomware attack chains, as well as the need to for CISOs to build better — and more intelligent — defenses to match AI-powered attackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From malware development to social engineering, adversaries are weaponizing AI to accelerate every stage of attacks, collapsing the defender’s window of response,” Elia Zaitsev, CTO at CrowdStrike, &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/press-releases/ransomware-report-ai-attacks-outpacing-defenses/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in announcing the survey’s findings. “The 2025 State of Ransomware Survey reinforces that legacy defenses can’t match the speed or sophistication of AI-driven attacks. Time is the currency of modern cyber defense — and in today’s AI-driven threat landscape, every second counts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-ransomware-stands-today"&gt;Where ransomware stands today&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike surveyed 1,100 IT and cybersecurity decision-makers across Australia, France, Germany, India, Singapore, United Kingdom, and United States to ask how they assess their ransomware readiness and navigate the evolving ransomware landscape, including the emergence of AI-enhanced threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following are the top takeaways from CrowdStrike’s report:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most organizations get hit with ransomware and some suffer from overconfidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Of the organizations surveyed, 78% reported experiencing a ransomware attack within the past year. Of those, half believed they were “very well prepared” for ransomware, but fewer than a quarter recovered from an attack within 24 hours. These statistics bear out what CrowdStrike calls the “confidence illusion,” a disparity between the expectation and reality of the organization’s ability to recover from an attack quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware payments are no safety nets&lt;/strong&gt;: According to the CrowdStrike survey, 83% of paying victims were attacked again, and 93% had data stolen anyway, with backups proving unreliable. Nearly 4 in 10 respondents said they were unable to restore the data they lost fully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing is the most common attack vector&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3850783/11-ways-cybercriminals-are-making-phishing-more-potent-than-ever.html"&gt;Phishing&lt;/a&gt; was cited by 45% of ransomware victim respondents as the initial point of compromise. Other frequently cited entry points include &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970094/cybercriminals-switch-up-their-top-initial-access-vectors-of-choice.html"&gt;vulnerability exploits&lt;/a&gt; (40%), &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4051668/71-of-cisos-hit-with-third-party-security-incident-this-year.html"&gt;supply chain compromise&lt;/a&gt; (35%), &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1308864/hackers-using-stolen-credentials-to-launch-attacks-as-info-stealing-peaks.html"&gt;compromised credentials&lt;/a&gt; (33%), malicious downloads (32%), &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3487743/attackers-increasingly-using-legitimate-remote-management-tools-to-hack-enterprises.html"&gt;misuse of remote monitoring and management&lt;/a&gt; (RMM) tools (31%), and insider threats (27%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware attacks are costly:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the survey results, organizations reported an average downtime cost of US$1.7 million per incident, but also incurred significant non-quantifiable costs. Among these were reputational damage, which affected 34% of victim organizations; legal and regulatory penalties, which impacted 24% of organizations; and publicly released or stolen data affected 24% of victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-attack improvements help but are often inadequate: &lt;/strong&gt;CrowdStrike’s survey results indicated that just about half (51%) of organizations increased general cybersecurity investment following attacks, and 47% improved detection and monitoring capabilities. Nearly half of the respondents (45%) said they enhanced training and awareness programs. But, only 38% addressed the specific issue they identified as enabling the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen AI-enabled phishing is a top concern:&lt;/strong&gt; 82% of the organizations surveyed believe generative AI makes phishing emails more challenging to identify, even for well-trained employees. Most organizations (87%) consider AI-generated social engineering tactics more convincing than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy defenses fall behind AI tools:&lt;/strong&gt; CrowdStrike’s research suggest that AI-powered threat detection tools are eclipsing the standard threat intelligence techniques. AI-powered threat detection leads adoption at 53% among surveyed organizations, followed by automated incident response at 51% and AI-enhanced phishing detection at 48%. Most security teams (85%) acknowledge traditional detection methods are not keeping pace with modern threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomwares-ai-powered-future"&gt;Ransomware’s AI-powered future&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although CrowdStrike’s latest survey doesn’t provide a full picture of AI’s use by ransomware gangs, the fact that generative AI is proving highly effective in crafting phishing emails that lead to ransomware infections shows the tip of the iceberg CISOs face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike Field CTO Cristian Rodriguez tells CSO, “We’re seeing AI touch every stage of the ransomware attack chain and it starts with phishing. Still the No. 1 entry point, AI-powered phishing campaigns are tricking employees into opening the door to corporate networks. The next wave will be even more deceptive, as AI-generated deepfakes emerge as a major driver of future ransomware attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Rodriguez, the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4014238/cybercriminals-take-malicious-ai-to-the-next-level.html"&gt;use AI to create malware&lt;/a&gt; is also rapidly evolving. “We’re increasingly seeing ransomware-as-a-service providers leverage AI-developed malware to deploy and disrupt systems,” he says. “So, AI is pervasive across the ransomware threat lifecycle — and it’s only accelerating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the AI era, speed is the new battleground. Attackers move from intrusion to encryption in minutes, not hours. “The data really reinforces that speed is the biggest challenge,” Rodriguez says. “Ransomware has always been a race to contain and neutralize, but AI has taken it to another level — attackers are moving from intrusion to encryption in minutes, not hours. The pace of today’s adversaries is what makes speed in modern security so important.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysis from managed detection and response firm Huntress earlier this year showed the average “time to ransom” — from initial access to extortion — &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3825444/ransomware-gangs-extort-victims-17-hours-after-intrusion-on-average.html"&gt;to be 17 hours&lt;/a&gt;, with some groups narrowing that window to 4 to 6 hours. But that was eight months ago in a rapidly advancing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Google kills its cookie killer</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076243/google-kills-its-cookie-killer.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Privacy Sandbox, Google’s attempt to create an alternative to cookies, looks like it has reached the end of the line. The company has announced that it is discontinuing 11 Privacy Sandbox technologies — pretty much the entire gamut. Privacy Sandbox VP Anthony Chavez said in &lt;a href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-update/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the team had reached the decision “after evaluating ecosystem feedback about their expected value and in light of their low levels of adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google launched the Privacy Sandbox initiative in August 2019 as a way for advertisers to gain information on users without the need to support third-party cookies. It met much criticism from the industry. Google’s dreams of a cookie-free future took a blow after the UK’s Competition and Market Authority announced that it was instigating an anti-trust investigation as to whether Google was abusing its dominant position in the browser market. It was an initiative that was followed up by a number of US states, each of whom is pursuing its own anti-trust case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This legal pressure eventually told. In July of last year, Google backtracked on its insistence that Privacy Sandbox would be the dominant privacy technology on Chrome. The CMA gave a guarded response to this and said that it was still seeking further commitments from Google. In April, the &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3967743/google-revises-privacy-sandbox-plans-amid-antitrust-ruling.html"&gt;company made more concessions&lt;/a&gt; and now, this latest move  seems to have satisfied all anti-trust concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the lack of take-up of Privacy Sandbox would probably have had more of part in its discontinuation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="poor-adoption"&gt;Poor adoption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javvad/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Javvad Malik&lt;/a&gt;, lead CISO advisor at software company KnowBe4, “Low uptake is a useful signal. It suggests the Sandbox bundle didn’t deliver enough measurable value versus operational complexity and risk. When incentives, tooling, and accountability aren’t aligned, even ‘privacy‑preserving’ tech struggles to gain adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that while he could see why Google would want an alternative to cookies, there was a technical requirement too.  “As for the cookie alternative, something being technically viable isn’t the same as adaptable. Tools need to be built with the users in mind. If there is too much friction with inconsistent APIs and uncertain ROI, many teams will struggle to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technologies Google is discontinuing are: Attribution Reporting API for both Chrome and Android,  IP Protection, Protected Audience API for Chrome and Android, Protected App Signals, On Device Personalization, Related Website Sets, Private Aggregation (including Shared Storage),  Select URL, SDK Runtime and Topics for both Chrome and Android.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that the Privacy Sandbox decision will have a marked effect on Google’s dominance of the browser market. &lt;a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chrome had a 72-percent share&lt;/a&gt; of the browser market in September, according to Statcounter. However, it looks likely that Google’s attempts to incorporate Privacy Sandbox technologies in future web standards will be discontinued. As Malik said “Standardisation is possible, but only where there’s multi‑stakeholder legitimacy. Without broad buy‑in from browsers, regulators, and publishers, “web standards” risk looking like vendor standards.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is not clear is what will happen to those companies that have been implementing Privacy Sandbox technologies within their own organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Google spokesman said, “We will be continuing our work to improve privacy across Chrome, Android and the web, but moving away from the Privacy Sandbox branding. We’re grateful to everyone who contributed to this initiative, and will continue to collaborate with the industry to develop and advance platform technologies that help support a healthy and thriving web.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Foreign hackers breached a US nuclear weapons plant via SharePoint flaws</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074962/foreign-hackers-breached-a-us-nuclear-weapons-plant-via-sharepoint-flaws.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A foreign threat actor infiltrated the &lt;a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/"&gt;Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC)&lt;/a&gt;, a key manufacturing site within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), exploiting unpatched Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to a source involved in an August incident response at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach targeted a plant that produces the vast majority of critical non-nuclear components for US nuclear weapons under the NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) that oversees the design, production, and maintenance of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp;amp; Technologies (FM&amp;amp;T) manages the Kansas City campus under contract to the NNSA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City campus, Honeywell FM&amp;amp;T, and the Department of Energy did not respond to repeated requests for comment throughout September, well before the current government shutdown. NSA public affairs officer Eddie Bennett did respond, saying, “We have nothing to contribute,” and referred CSO back to the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it is unclear whether the attackers were a Chinese nation-state actor or Russian cybercriminals — the two most likely culprits — experts say the incident drives home the importance of securing systems that protect operational technology from exploits that primarily affect IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-breach-unfolded"&gt;How the breach unfolded&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers exploited &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025691/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-breach-hits-on-prem-servers.html"&gt;two recently disclosed Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; — CVE-2025-53770, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution (RCE) bug — both affecting on-premises servers. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/"&gt;issued fixes&lt;/a&gt; for the vulnerabilities on July 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On July 22, the NNSA &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/us-nuclear-weapons-agency-breached-in-microsoft-sharepoint-hack"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was one of the organizations hit by attacks enabled by the SharePoint flaws. “On Friday, July 18th, the exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint zero-day vulnerability began affecting the Department of Energy,” a DOE spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the DOE contended at the time, “The department was minimally impacted due to its widespread use of the Microsoft M365 cloud and very capable cybersecurity systems. A very small number of systems were impacted. All impacted systems are being restored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early August, federal responders, including personnel from the NSA, were on-site at the Kansas City facility, the source tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Located in Missouri, the &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/ea/kansas-city-national-security-campus"&gt;KCNSC manufactures&lt;/a&gt; non-nuclear mechanical, electronic, and engineered material components used in US nuclear defense systems. It also provides specialized technical services, including metallurgical analysis, analytical chemistry, environmental testing, and simulation modeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roughly 80% of the non-nuclear parts in the nation’s nuclear stockpile &lt;a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/about-us/overview/"&gt;originate from KCNSC&lt;/a&gt;. While most design and programmatic details remain classified, the plant’s production role makes it one of the most sensitive facilities in the federal weapons complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="china-or-russia-conflicting-attribution"&gt;China or Russia? Conflicting attribution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/#storm-2603"&gt;attributed the broader wave of SharePoint exploitations&lt;/a&gt; to three Chinese-linked groups: Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and a third actor it tracks as Storm-2603. The company said the attackers were preparing to deploy Warlock ransomware across affected systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the source familiar with the Kansas City incident tells CSO that a Russian threat actor, not a Chinese one, was responsible for the intrusion. Cybersecurity company Resecurity, which was monitoring the SharePoint exploitations, tells CSO that its own data pointed primarily to Chinese nation-state groups, but it does not rule out Russian involvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resecurity’s researchers say that while Chinese groups appeared to have developed and deployed the initial zero-day, financially motivated Russian actors may have independently reproduced the exploit before technical details began circulating in late June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May, researchers at Viettel Cyber Security &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-exploited-in-rce-attacks-no-patch-available/"&gt;demonstrated an attack chaining two SharePoint flaws&lt;/a&gt;, CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704, at Pwn2Own Berlin. Resecurity researchers tell CSO that those demonstrations likely accelerated the reverse-engineering of the vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resecurity’s analysts observed early-stage scanning and exploitation activity from infrastructure located in Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, and Hong Kong, a distribution pattern consistent with tactics used by Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to disguise attribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The root cause of the SharePoint exploitation is closely related to misuse of the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) by China,” Resecurity researchers tell CSO. “The most probable perpetrators are Chinese nation-state actors such as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, they say that yet another way that Russia-based threat actors could have acquired knowledge of the vulnerability early on was through underground exchanges or by analyzing network scanning data once the exploit became known. The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4027971/microsofts-incomplete-sharepoint-patch-led-to-global-exploits-by-china-linked-hackers.html"&gt;transition from zero-day to N-day status&lt;/a&gt;, they say, opened a window for secondary actors to exploit systems that had not yet applied the patches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="could-the-attack-have-reached-operational-systems"&gt;Could the attack have reached operational systems?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach targeted the IT side of the Kansas City campus, but the intrusion raises the question of whether attackers could have moved laterally into the facility’s operational technology (OT) systems, the manufacturing and process control environments that directly support weapons component production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OT cybersecurity specialists interviewed by CSO say that KCNSC’s production systems are likely air-gapped or otherwise isolated from corporate IT networks, significantly reducing the risk of direct crossover. Nevertheless, they caution against assuming such isolation guarantees safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have to really consider and think through how state actors potentially exploit IT vulnerabilities to gain access to that operational technology,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jensovada/"&gt;Jen Sovada&lt;/a&gt;, general manager of public sector operations at Claroty, speaking generally and not about the specific incident, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you have a facility like the KCNSC where they do nuclear weapons lifecycle management — design, manufacturing, emergency response, decommissioning, supply chain management — there are multiple interconnected functions,” Sovada says. “If an actor can move laterally, they could impact programmable logic controllers that run robotics or precision assembly equipment for non-nuclear weapon components.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such access, Sovada adds, could also affect distribution control systems that oversee quality assurance, or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that manage utilities, power, and environmental controls. “It’s broader than just an IT vulnerability,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-ot-convergence-and-the-zero-trust-gap"&gt;IT/OT convergence and the zero-trust gap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City incident highlights a systemic problem across the federal enterprise: the disconnect between IT and OT security practices. While the federal government has advanced its zero-trust roadmap for traditional IT networks, similar frameworks for operational environments have lagged, although recent developments point to progress on that front.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s an &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/deploy/networks"&gt;IT fan chart&lt;/a&gt; that maps all of the controls for zero trust, segmentation, authentication, and identity management,” Sovada says. “But there’s also an &lt;a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/dod-official-sees-new-zero-trust-ot-iot-guidance-in-september/#:~:text=The%20DoD%20official%20also%20provided,OT%20%E2%80%9Clikely%20around%20August.%E2%80%9D"&gt;OT fan chart&lt;/a&gt; being developed by the Department of Defense that will define comparable controls for zero trust in operational technology. The goal is to marry the two, so that zero trust becomes comprehensive across all network types.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That alignment, she says, is essential to preventing intrusions like the one that struck KCNSC from cascading into physical operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="even-non-classified-data-theft-holds-strategic-value"&gt;Even non-classified data theft holds strategic value&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the source’s claim of Russian involvement is accurate, the attackers may have been financially motivated ransomware operators rather than state intelligence services. But even in that scenario, the data they accessed could still carry strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would make sense that if it were a ransomware actor and they got this kind of data about nuclear weapons manufacturing, they might pause and hand it off to the appropriate Russian government officials or experts,” Sovada tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that classified information was compromised, even unclassified technical data can have significant implications. “It could be something as simple as requirements documents that may not be classified but reveal the level of precision required for components,” Sovada says. “In weapons manufacturing, a millimeter difference can change a device’s trajectory or the reliability of its arming mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such information could aid adversaries in understanding US weapons tolerances, supply chain dependencies, or manufacturing processes, all of which are sensitive even if not formally secret.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether the intruders were Chinese state actors or Russian cybercriminals, the Kansas City breach exposes the fragile intersection of IT and operational security across critical defense infrastructure. As Sovada stresses, “We can’t just think of zero trust as an IT concept anymore. It has to extend into the physical systems that underpin national defense.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: The Department of Energy (DOE) &lt;a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/zIpmCk6xoxI592Kxt2fVuGXZyW?domain=edition.cnn.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that it is furloughing the vast major of the NNSA’s workers. DOE spokesperson said, “Since its creation in 2000, NNSA has never before furloughed federal workers during funding lapses. We are left with no choice this time. We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Self-propagating worm found in marketplaces for Visual Studio Code extensions</title>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A month after a self-propagating worm was &lt;a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/the-shai-hulud-attack-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discovered in the open source NPM code repository&lt;/a&gt;, a similar worm has been found targeting Visual Studio Code extensions in open marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/glassworm-first-self-propagating-worm-using-invisible-code-hits-openvsx-marketplace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at Israel-based Koi Security&lt;/a&gt; say the malware, which they dub GlassWorm, has been found in extensions in the OpenVSX and Microsoft VS Code marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the most sophisticated supply chain attacks we’ve ever analyzed,” the researchers warn. “And it’s spreading right now.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the compromised extensions are folded into code, they harvest NPM, GitHub, and Git credentials left by developers in their work, drain funds from 49 cryptocurrency wallets, deploy SOCKS proxy servers on developer computers, install hidden VNX servers for remote access, and use stolen credentials to compromise additional packages and extensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven OpenVSX extensions were compromised last week and were downloaded over 35,000 times, the report says. In addition, another infected extension was detected in the VS Code marketplace over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worms in the extensions evade detection using an old technique: Including malware written with Unicode variation selectors. These are special characters that are part of the Unicode specification but don’t produce any visual output.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To a developer doing code review, it looks like blank lines or whitespace,” says Koi Security. “To static analysis tools scanning for suspicious code, it looks like nothing at all.” But to a JavaScript interpreter, it’s executable code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CISOs should treat this as an immediate security incident if their developers use VS Code,” says Tanya Janca, head of the Canadian secure coding training consultancy SheHacksPurple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because extensions inherit full VS Code permissions, once installed they can steal credentials, exfiltrate source code, and enable remote command and control (for example, via VNC and SOCKS proxies). Risk level: Very High.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should start their incident response processes immediately, she said, conducting an inventory to see which corporate applications use VS Code, which extensions they contain, and determining if any are on the known affected list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They should also monitor for suspicious application behavior, she added, specifically strange outgoing connections and processes mentioned in the research, unapproved VNC servers, and long-lived SOCKS proxy processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="educate-your-developers"&gt;Educate your developers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Janca recommends disabling all application auto-updates, and educating all developers about the situation and the extensions to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Block access to the OpenVSX registry and all other untrusted/unknown marketplaces, permanently,” she advises. “Have developers log out of their developer tools and reboot. Revoke and then rotate any credentials that might have been spilled before logging back into everything.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Follow normal practices for incident response, she concluded: Detect, contain, eradicate, recover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="marketplaces-targeted"&gt;Marketplaces targeted&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Koi Security report is the latest in a series of warnings that threat actors are increasingly targeting VS Code marketplaces in supply chain attacks.  Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072829/tigerjacks-malicious-vscode-extensions-mine-steal-and-stay-hidden.html" target="_blank"&gt;Koi Security exposed&lt;/a&gt; a threat actor dubbed TigerJack spreading malicious extensions. And &lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4074939/threat-actors-are-spreading-malicious-extensions-via-vs-marketplaces.html" target="_blank"&gt;researchers at Wiz just published research&lt;/a&gt; showing the widespread abuse of the OpenVSX and VS Code marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The use of Unicode to hide malware was &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059606/meet-shadowleak-impossible-to-detect-data-theft-using-ai.html" target="_blank"&gt;exposed as recently as last month&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Radware, who found it being used to compromise ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These reports should come as no surprise. Open code marketplaces, where developers can upload code for others to use in their applications, have long been targets for threat actors as vehicles for inserting malicious code into projects. The code then spreads into developer or customer environments to steal credentials and data. Collectively, these are known as supply chain attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the most targeted repositories are GitHub, GitLab and &lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4060306/npm-attacks-and-the-security-of-software-supply-chains.html" target="_blank"&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft gives developers the ability to add extensions and themes to Visual Studio Code to make life easier for developers, as well as to enhance functionality. An extension can add features like debuggers, new languages, or other development tools, while a theme is a type of extension that changes the appearance of the editor, controlling things like colors and fonts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leverages-blockchain"&gt;Leverages blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koi Security researchers came across the wormed extension in OpenVSX when their risk engine flagged suspicious activity in an update of an extension called CodeJoy. a developer productivity tool with hundreds of downloads. However, version 1.8.3 introduced some suspicious behavioural changes. The source code included what looked like massive gap between lines that was actually malicious code encoded in unprintable Unicode characters that can’t be viewed in a code editor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse, the malware uses the public &lt;a href="https://solana.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Solana blockchain&lt;/a&gt; as a command and control infrastructure (C2) for its goal of hunting for login credentials, especially those for crypto wallets. The malware also reaches out to a Google Calendar event as a backup C2 mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stolen NPM, GitHub, Git, and OpenVSX credentials also help the malware spread as a worm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the malware injects a remote access trojan onto the workstations of victim developers, turning them into SOCKS proxy servers. The workstations can then be used to access an organization’s IT systems, becoming internal network access points, persistent backdoors, proxies for attacking other internal systems and data exfiltration channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="developers-are-prime-target"&gt;Developers are ‘prime target’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers are a prime target for attacks these days, pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute. What they often don’t realize is that any extension they install, even if it appears benign, has full access to their code and may make modifications without explicitly informing the developer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs must include developers in discussions about securing development tools, he advises. Limiting permitted tools is often counterproductive, as developers will identify workarounds to get work done. Security must cooperate with developers to assist them in using the tools they need securely, and any endpoint protection product needs to be tuned to support the unique usage patterns of developers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a supply-chain problem, said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-baxter-1b350611/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Will Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, field CISO at Team Cymru, it’s a new infrastructure layer merging cyber-crime tooling, blockchain resilience, and developer-tooling pivoting. Registry operators, threat researchers and blockchain-monitoring partners need to share intelligence and work together more closely to flag these hybrid attacks, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="more-advice-to-csos"&gt;More advice to CSOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Janca says to lower the risk of supply chain attacks, security leaders and application security professionals should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reduce attack surface whenever possible: Only install features and other software that they use, for instance, uninstall any VS Code extensions that are not used, and remove all unused dependencies from code;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;monitor all employee workstations for anomalous behavior, with more focus on those who have privileged access, such as software developers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;apply least privilege for identity and access management, especially for developer machines&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;implement a fast and efficient change management process that includes software supply chain changes;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;train developers on secure coding, protecting their supply chain, and their role during incident response, to help prevent issues like this in the future or to respond faster and more gracefully&lt;br /&gt;There are various security scanning tools that can be used to reduce risk and catch issues before they become security incidents, such as extension scanners, secret scanners, supply chain security tooling (SCA and SBOM), and endpoint protection;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;follow proper secret manage best practices, so that malicious packages like these cannot harvest credentials;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;only approved repositories, marketplaces, etc. should be used in an organizations. Block all unknown or untrusted places for downloading code, packages, images, and extensions;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;harden the entire software supply chain, not just third-party components and code. This includes regular updates and locking down access to the CI/CD, developer IDEs and workstations, artifacts, and more.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;push governments to provide a solution to the very insecure open source software ecosystem that so many of us rely on. Or, give preference closed-source development languages and frameworks, though this, she admits, wouldn’t have helped in this case, as .Net is closed source but VS Code Marketplace is not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The position affords me an opportunity to remain on the front lines, engaging directly with customers, as well as draw on my leadership experience to build a high-performing team to expand our North American presence,” said Levinson. “Sendmarc has built every capability modern DMARC users expect, without compromising on standards or email deliverability best practices that are often overlooked by other providers in the space. What I’m most impressed with, though, is the dedication and subject matter expertise across the global customer success team. Most team members have had successful careers in other areas of cybersecurity, which strengthens the care and support our customers receive. I honestly couldn’t ask for more when I consider the capabilities and sophistication of the platform, the dedicated staff, and the incredibly trusting leadership group here. Sendmarc is the DMARC solution that the North American market should be very excited about.” Rob Bowker, North America Region Lead at Sendmarc, commented: “The DMARC space is crowded with a lot of noise, but every now and then, you find the people who cut through it. I’ve had the good fortune of working alongside Dan not once, but twice – and this time, we’re doing it with the right platform and the right leadership. I’m very excited about this second chance to get it right.” &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CAASM and EASM: Top 12 attack surface discovery and management tools</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/574797/9-attack-surface-discovery-and-management-tools.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber asset attack surface management (CAASM) or external attack surface management (EASM) solutions are designed to quantify the attack surface and minimize and harden it. The goal with CAASM tools is to give the adversary as little information about the security posture of the business as possible while still maintaining critical business services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever watched a heist film, step one in executing the score of the century is casing the place: observing security measures, measuring response times, and mapping out escape routes. This process is similar to both attacking and protecting enterprise IT resources: Gain knowledge of publicly visible resources on the internet, learn what makes up the technology stack, and find vulnerabilities and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="basics-of-the-attack-surface-management"&gt;Basics of the attack surface management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573661/top-5-attack-surface-challenges-related-to-security-operations.html"&gt;attack surface&lt;/a&gt; is the entirety of corporate resources – also known as assets – accessible from the internet in some form. This could be applications hosted on-premises with ports opened through the corporate firewall, SaaS applications hosted in the cloud, or any number of cloud-hosted resources with a public presence. The attack surface includes things like open ports and protocols, SSL and cryptographic standards being used, applications being hosted, and even the server platforms hosting the application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The units that make up the attack surface are referred to as assets. They are the IP address or domain name, coupled with the technology stack that makes up the application or service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerabilities are configuration deficiencies or unpatched software that leave the door open for an attack by malicious users to compromise one or more systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While attack surface management is primarily focused on assets on the public-facing internet, assets within the bounds of a corporate data center or cloud networks can also put a business at risk if not properly monitored and managed. Because these assets are not available to outside entities the ability to monitor them requires either a software agent or the ability for the monitoring service to reach into your network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Servers and applications often have a soft underbelly when viewed from within the corporate network. Any monitoring tool must evaluate a wider range of services and, in many cases, test the services as both an anonymous user and one that’s authenticated to the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="caasm-and-easm-tools-for-attack-surface-discovery-and-management"&gt;CAASM and EASM tools for attack surface discovery and management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Periodic scans of the network are no longer sufficient for maintaining a hardened attack surface. Continuous monitoring for new assets and configuration drift are critical to ensure the security of corporate resources and customer data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New assets need to be identified and incorporated into the monitoring solution as these could potentially be part of a brand attack or shadow IT. Configuration drift could be benign and part of a design change, but also has the potential to be the result of human error or the early stages of an attack. Identifying these changes early allows for the cybersecurity team to react appropriately and mitigate any further damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are 12 tools to help discovering and managing risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="axonius-cyber-asset-attack-surface-management"&gt;Axonius Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Axonius offers a robust &lt;a href="https://www.axonius.com/platform/cyber-asset-attack-surface-management-caasm"&gt;CAASM suite&lt;/a&gt; that touches all the key factors for monitoring the attack surface. It starts with an asset inventory which is updated automatically and fleshed out with context from both internal data sources and resources Axonius has access to outside a user’s network. It can also perform monitoring based on security controls from policy sets such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/569591/pci-dss-explained-requirements-fines-and-steps-to-compliance.html"&gt;PCI&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570241/hipaa-explained-definition-compliance-and-violations.html"&gt;HIPAA&lt;/a&gt;, identifying configurations or vulnerabilities that equate to policy violations, allowing the user to take action to resolve the finding. Pricing on AWS marketplace for the entire Axonius cloud starts at $90,000 per year for 500 assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="bugcrowd-easm"&gt;Bugcrowd EASM&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bugcrowd acquired Informer’s &lt;a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/products/attack-surface-management"&gt;EASM&lt;/a&gt; product in May 2024 and has integrated it into its security platform. It automates asset discovery across web applications, APIs, and other aspects of the public-facing business IT stack. These assets are monitored continuously, with any risks identified being prioritized in real time. Informer offers add-on services to perform manual risk validation and even pen testing. The workflow-based response system facilitates incorporating multiple teams into incident response by integrating with existing ticketing and communication applications. Once identified threats have been mitigated, retesting can be initiated immediately to validate the configuration change or system update has fully remediated the risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="crowdstrike-falcon-exposure-management"&gt;CrowdStrike Falcon Exposure Management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike has transformed Falcon Surface from a standalone EASM tool into a core part of &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/exposure-management"&gt;Falcon Exposure Management&lt;/a&gt;, adding AI-native code to proactively identify and eliminate enterprise risk. The software goes beyond alert identification to use adversary-driven AI to deliver real risk reduction. It can correlate exposures with business context, validating exploitability, and enabling direct remediation in Falcon. Enterprises can get an outside-in view of their attack surface and discover internet-connected assets using a variety of techniques, including active, passive, and API-based scans. Using a proprietary and continuously running internet mapping technology, its engine can determine location information and see real-time changes. Customers are seeing up to 98% fewer critical vulnerabilities and 75% smaller external attack surfaces. Specific pricing is not available, and this tool is not part of its enterprise software bundle. It can be purchased as a subscription license on a per managed endpoint basis, with unmanaged asset coverage included at each tier. The above link also has an interactive demo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cycognito-attack-surface-management"&gt;CyCognito Attack Surface Management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CyCognito’s &lt;a href="https://www.cycognito.com/attack-surface-management"&gt;CAASM&lt;/a&gt; product provides continuous monitoring and inventory of assets whether they reside on-premises, in the cloud, with a third-party, or through a subsidiary. Business context such as ownership and relationships between assets can be added to facilitate the triage process and aid in prioritizing response to risk. This context and intelligent prioritization (evaluating things like ease of exploitation and asset classification) helps focus on the most critical risks to the network. CyCognito also tracks configuration drift on assets, enabling the view of change history and identifying new risks to the corporate infrastructure. Pricing on AWS marketplace is $30,000 per year for 250 assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jupiterone-cyber-asset-attack-surface-management"&gt;JupiterOne Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JupiterOne bills its &lt;a href="https://www.jupiterone.com/cyber-asset-attack-surface-management"&gt;CAASM&lt;/a&gt; solution as a way to seamlessly aggregate cyber asset data into a unified view. Context is added automatically where appropriate, and asset relationships can be defined and optimized to enhance vulnerability analysis and incident response. Custom queries allow the cybersecurity team to answer complex questions, while asset inventory can be browsed using an interactive visual map, enabling evaluation of incident scope and prioritization of response. Your existing investments into security tools can be leveraged using integrations, turning JupiterOne into a holistic centralized view into your corporate security posture. Pricing on AWS marketplace is based on company size and starts at $24,000 per year for up to 500 employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-external-attack-surface-management"&gt;Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-external-attack-surface-management"&gt;Microsoft Defender EASM&lt;/a&gt; provides discovery of unmanaged assets and resources, including those deployed by shadow IT and assets residing in other cloud platforms. Once assets and resources are identified, Defender EASM probes for vulnerabilities at every layer of the technology stack, including the underlying platform, app frameworks, web applications, components, and core code. It can quickly remediate vulnerabilities in newly discovered resources by categorizing and prioritizing vulnerabilities in real time as they’re discovered. It integrates with Microsoft’s Security Copilot and Exposure Management to obtain snapshots of the attack surface. Defender EASM has enhanced and more actionable data dashboards. It is priced at a penny per month per managed asset.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="outpost24-easm"&gt;Outpost24 EASM&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Outpost24 acquired Belgian software company Sweepatic and has incorporated its &lt;a href="https://outpost24.com/products/external-attack-surface-management"&gt;EASM&lt;/a&gt; tool into its collection of threat intelligence, data leakage and pen testing modules. Its EASM software is available both directly or as a managed service and can collect data either passively using DNS and other TCP/IP details or with direct connections to cloud providers such as AWS and Azure along with other major software players such as ServiceNow, Slack, Axonius and Atlassian’s Jira. Pricing starts at $17,000 per year and is based on the number of assets under management and other factors such as integration with its other security modules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="palo-alto-networks-cortex-xpanse"&gt;Palo Alto Networks Cortex Xpanse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xpanse"&gt;Xpanse&lt;/a&gt; is part of Palo Alto’s XSIAM product suite but can be purchased separately. There is a slightly smaller feature set on the standalone product. It came out of a 2020 acquisition, and it has been tightly integrated into the Palo Alto universe of XSOAR and other XSIAM modules, including playbook automations and remediations. It also &lt;a href="https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XPANSE/2/Cortex-Xpanse-Expander-User-Guide/Integrations"&gt;supports integration with third-party tools&lt;/a&gt; such as Qualys, Jira, and ServiceNow. The product comes with an impressive array of pre-built detection rules, widgets to assist in constructing queries and discovery routines, and numerous data dashboards that can be customized for particular audiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="rapid7-surface-command"&gt;Rapid7 Surface Command&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/products/command/attack-surface-management-asm"&gt;Surface Command&lt;/a&gt; is just one of numerous modules offered by Rapid7 that include vulnerability and incident management and cloud native security. It unifies threat exposure, detection, and response, designed to provide a continuous birds-eye view of vulnerabilities from endpoint to cloud to close security gaps and prevent attacks. It is designed to eliminate blind spots and to help accelerate response and remediation. It also includes agentic AI features that are designed for security operations staff to guide threat response. It is priced on a complex calculator based on the average number of monitored assets and free trials are available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="riskprofiler-io-easm"&gt;RiskProfiler.io EASM&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://riskprofiler.io/"&gt;RiskProfiler uses a single platform&lt;/a&gt; that manages all external threats including dark web, digital monitoring, tracking emerging hacking campaigns, vulnerabilities and supply chain attacks. These threats are tied together with agentic AI tools to provide a unified threat corpus. The product has 13,000 rules pre-installed that bridges both open source and their own proprietary algorithms. One module analyzes vendor third-party risk assessments as part of its threat intelligence. It comes with a customizable management dashboard to show various views. Priced on the number of assets under management and which modules are deployed (such as choosing continuous assessments versus discrete scheduled ones) and whether it is purchased directly or through a managed services partner.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="socradar-attackmapper"&gt;SOCRadar AttackMapper&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SOCRadar is a general-purpose threat intelligence tool that attempts to give users an attacker’s-eye view of assets through &lt;a href="https://socradar.io/suites/attack-surface-management/"&gt;AttackMapper&lt;/a&gt;. It uses agentic-based threat intel to set up smart workflows, also performs dynamic monitoring against assets in real-time, identifying new or changed assets and analyzing those changes for potential vulnerabilities. SOCRadar correlates their findings with known vulnerabilities and attack methods to bring context to the decision making and triage process. AttackMapper does more than monitor endpoints and software vulnerabilities, as things like SSL weaknesses and certificate expiration, and even DNS records and configuration are fair game. Even website defacement can be identified by AttackMapper to protect brand reputation, and there are other modules for dark web and blockchain monitoring, data leak protection and domain takedowns. There is a free edition, and paid versions start at $8,000/year and are based on the size of the digital footprint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tenable-asm"&gt;Tenable ASM&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/attack-surface-management"&gt;Tenable’s ASM&lt;/a&gt; tool is part of its integrated One exposure management platform that can collect data to help visualize attack paths, evaluate vulnerabilities, and understand the larger threat landscape. Tenable’s unified approach provides security teams with an up-to-date inventory and exposure context needed to confidently identify, prioritize and eliminate risk. It can easily categorize assets using 200 fields of metadata, severity ranking and comprehensive filtering to make informed decisions. It can monitor infrastructure changes to gain an up-to-date view of your assets as your attack surface changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-to-ask-potential-vendors"&gt;Questions to ask potential vendors:&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The days of imagining your attack surface as static and easily tracked are gone. The state of your attack surface changes in sometimes imperceptible ways,” wrote Palo Alto Networks’ &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/research/2023-unit-42-attack-surface-threat-report"&gt;Unit42 in a 2023 threat report&lt;/a&gt;. This means potential ASM buyers need to understand how these changes happen and how they can neutralize them. Here are some questions to ask your team and the vendors about their ASM offerings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we need a cyber or external-based ASM tool? It depends whether you are looking for the enemy within or without and the proportion of your on-premises infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How much automation is used and how effective is it? Does the ASM tool discover all your vulnerable assets, including digital certificates, exposed user credentials, and other internet-facing servers and services? What metadata and other details, such as open TCP/IP ports and network shares, are part of this discovery?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Once vulnerabilities are found, how are they remediated? Are they automatically fixed or is some human action required?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Does the ASM tool perform continuous monitoring, and how are these changes reported?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What vulnerabilities are shared and how are they shared or integrated with other SOC tools?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Are there different dashboards for management and other consumers of ASM results to make the tool more actionable and useful to these different audiences, such as the cloud security team and security auditors?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Finally, make sure you understand the vendor’s pricing. Most have complex usage-based pricing that is more of a custom quote and very few offer public and transparent pricing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Salesforce’s glaring Dreamforce omission: Vital security lessons from Salesloft Drift</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076024/dreamforce-finds-salesforce-weathering-a-security-storm.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce’s flagship Dreamforce conference last week offered attendees a range of sessions on best practices for securing their Salesforce environments and AI agents, and about what Salesforce itself is doing with AI to improve security. The company even &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4069285/salesforce-ai-agents-set-to-assist-enterprises-with-security-and-compliance.html"&gt;released two new agents aimed at CISOs ahead of the event&lt;/a&gt;, one to handle security issues and an agent for addressing privacy and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, security as a shared responsibility was the theme: Salesforce is doing its part, and customers need to do theirs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what the conference didn’t address were weaknesses exposed by the recent spate of Salesforce-related breaches that affected more than 700 companies and nearly 1.5 billion records, inspiring 70-plus lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was at the event, and I talked to all the leadership, and this was not one of the topics,” says Chirag Mehta, a vice president at Constellation Research. “This didn’t come up.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The omission was a likely missed opportunity, given that the lessons of what has gone down in the Salesforce ecosystem over the past few months are significant for the increasingly connected and AI-infused future that is central to Salesforce’s agentic vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="anatomy-of-a-third-party-cyber-disaster"&gt;Anatomy of a third-party cyber disaster&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At issue is one of the largest SaaS supply-chain breaches in recent years. According to the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift"&gt;Google Threat Intelligence Group&lt;/a&gt;, over &lt;a href="https://cyberscoop.com/salesforce-salesloft-drift-attack-spree-google/"&gt;700 organizations&lt;/a&gt; were impacted by an August breach in which the “actor systematically exported large volumes of data from numerous corporate Salesforce instances.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seeing as the data had been stored by Salesforce, non-cyber professionals might assume this was a Salesforce breach, but that was not the case, Mehta says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes, the breach happened in a Salesforce instance,” he explains. “But it was not caused by something Salesforce did. The people who understand what’s going on, they understand what Salesforce is supposed to do, and what the customers were supposed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, the breach occurred when a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4046407/attackers-steal-data-from-salesforce-instances-via-compromised-ai-live-chat-tool.html"&gt;threat actor obtained Salesforce OAuth tokens&lt;/a&gt; from third-party AI chat tool Salesloft Drift and used the tokens to download large volumes of data from Salesforce instances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesforce, which has attempted to minimize the breach’s severity by saying “&lt;a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005134951&amp;amp;type=1"&gt;a small number of customers&lt;/a&gt;” were affected, noted that when it detected the activity, it “invalidated active Access and Refresh Tokens, and removed Drift from AppExchange. We then notified affected customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But according to Salesforce customer Cloudflare, the CDN giant saw the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/response-to-salesloft-drift-incident/"&gt;first signs&lt;/a&gt; of reconnaissance related to the breach on Aug. 9, with an attacker gaining access to Cloudflare’s Salesforce tenant on Aug. 12. By Aug. 17, the attackers had analyzed Cloudflare’s Salesforce case workflows, derived insights into how Cloudflare’s team members handle various types of cases, and completed their exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three days later, on Aug. 20, Salesforce revoked Salesloft Drift connections and published its notice on its website. “At that point, Cloudflare had not yet been notified, and we had no indication that this vendor action might relate to our environment,” Cloudflare’s security leaders stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare wasn’t alone. Hundreds of companies were affected, including some of the biggest names in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mitiga.io/blog/shinyhunters-and-unc6395-inside-the-salesforce-and-salesloft-breaches"&gt;Mitiga Security researcher Idan Cohen wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “In the Drift case, customers weren’t careless. The attackers didn’t hack their way in. They logged in, pretending to be a trusted third-party service.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the only case involving breached Salesforce accounts. In June, a different group of attackers, known as ShinyHunters, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4035701/we-too-were-breached-says-google-months-after-revealing-salesforce-attacks.html"&gt;pretended to be IT support personnel&lt;/a&gt;, in order to trick users into approving a connection to a malicious version of Salesforce’s Data Loader application that then exfiltrated data from Salesforce environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google, whose threat intelligence team described these attacks in a June report, itself fell victim to such an attack in August.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By October, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067846/extortion-gang-opens-data-leak-site-to-squeeze-victims-of-its-salesforce-attacks.html"&gt;attackers claimed to have stolen more than 1.5 billion Salesforce records&lt;/a&gt; from 760 companies. They also launched an extortion campaign against Salesforce and its compromised enterprise customers, including Toyota, FedEx, Hulu, and UPS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Salesforce, claiming the company didn’t do enough to vet third-party applications connected to its systems, or to monitor for signs of data exfiltration and other malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Salesforce … had the duty and ability to control its software environment and prevent these attacks from succeeding through implementation of security protocols that other companies in Salesforce’s industry regularly and routinely implement. But Salesforce did not,” said one complaint in a &lt;a href="https://mdlcases.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MDL-3164.pdf"&gt;class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed on Aug. 29 in California.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The potential for OAuth exploitation “was a known risk” and Salesforce failed to vet third-party connections, build protections, or monitor its networks against this kind of malicious activity, another group of class-action claimants said in a &lt;a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/filings/DM725Z2I/Johnson_v_Salesforce_Inc__candce-25-08011__0001.0.pdf"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; filed in September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to San Diego law firm CaseyGerry, there are now more than &lt;a href="https://caseygerry.com/blog/salesforce-data-breach-lawsuit/"&gt;70 cases filed&lt;/a&gt; across the country related to the Salesforce data breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-biggest-blind-spot"&gt;The biggest blind spot&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When companies delegate access to third parties via OAuth integrations, it creates a systemic security blind spot that spans all industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By stealing those tokens, attackers can gain access to all connected systems. “Authorizing a malicious connected app bypasses many traditional defenses such as MFA, password resets and login monitoring, and because OAuth tokens are issued by Salesforce itself, activity coming from the malicious app can look like it’s from a trusted integration,” the FBI &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250912.pdf"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; in an alert released in September.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of such weaknesses is only going to get worse — especially as AI-related integrations increasingly become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whereas a traditional CRM integration might need contact data, “an AI sales assistant typically requires contacts, email histories, calendar information, deal pipeline data, conversation logs, and product catalogs,” noted Trend Micro AI security expert Fernando Tucci in a report on why the &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/ai-app-breach.html"&gt;breach of Salesloft Drift — an AI chatbot — hits differently&lt;/a&gt;. “This broader access pattern means a single compromised AI integration can expose significantly more sensitive information than traditional point solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse, because AI chatbots are specifically designed to access large data sets, when a malicious actor piggybacks on the same connection to steal data, the traffic pattern can look legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding all these partnerships and connections requires close coordination with vendor management, says Steve Winterfeld, advisory CISO at Akamai. “Plus, understanding where your data is takes both culture-driven policies and technical controls,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With white-labeled services, APIs, and now LLMs, these two goals are much more complex. “If you haven’t conducted a supply chain breach exercise yet, now is the time,” Winterfeld says. “These recent events underscore the importance of validating your program.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ironically, many security firms were among the victims, including Zscaler, Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, Pager Duty, SpyCloud, Tenable, Proofpoint, Rubrik, BeyondTrust, Bugcrowd, JFrog, CyberArk, and Black Duck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="one-company-who-didnt-fall-victim"&gt;One company who didn’t fall victim&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One company that wasn’t scathed by the breaches was cloud-based IAM vendor Okta. Why? It allowed connections only from authorized IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/newsroom/articles/the-salesloft-incident--a-wake-up-call-for-saas-security-and-ips/"&gt;According to Okta&lt;/a&gt;, when the company learned of the compromise, it immediately reviewed its logs and found attempts to access resources with stolen tokens — but those attempts failed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The single most important control that prevented this breach was our enforcement of inbound IP restrictions,” the company said. “The threat actor attempted to use a compromised token to access our Salesforce instance, but the attack failed because the connection originated from an unauthorized IP address. This security layer proved essential, blocking the unauthorized attempt at the front door before any access could be gained.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This whitelisting approach to security is a powerful tactic, but it’s difficult to implement because it requires a great deal of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is that not all SaaS vendors support this capability. “Many providers in the cloud-first world do not offer this foundational security feature, creating a significant challenge for protecting interconnected systems,” Okta said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foundational security benchmarks for SaaS providers are only now coming together, following the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4063383/cloud-security-alliance-launches-framework-to-improve-saas-security.html"&gt;Cloud Security Alliance’s recently launched SaaS Security Capability Framework (SSCF)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okta noted that Salesforce already offers this functionality, but added that using it requires “significant effort,” given that restrictions have to be configured for APIs and users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another way to protect connections is to limit them to a specific client, using demonstrating proof of possession (DPoP), which prevents the reuse of stolen tokens, but this is even more difficult in practice because it requires changes to the authentication flow and adds new requirements for clients and servers. Another option is mutual TLS, which offers even stronger security, but at an even higher cost of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the financial sector, for example, some regulators mandate DPoP or mTLS; while it isn’t mandated in healthcare, there’s a use case there as well, according to &lt;a href="https://tyk.io/blog/demonstrating-proof-of-possession-dpop-oauth2-security-for-fapi-2-0-and-open-banking/"&gt;Tyk Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More companies should be looking at upgrading this as their use of interconnected SaaS apps and AI tools increases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Internet Engineering Task Force &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9700#name-sender-constrained-access-t"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; both DPoP and mTLS among its best practices for OAuth security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="compounding-risk-going-forward"&gt;Compounding risk going forward&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When companies allow connections to systems outside their perimeter, they need to understand the risks they are assuming and the security controls available to them, Constellation’s Mehta says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even a control as straightforward and common as multi-factor authentication can be difficult to implement for all employees, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From a solution provider perspective, they provide a specific set of security controls and features and it’s up to the customers to make sure they actually use them. In my view, it is a shared responsibility,” Mehta says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shared responsibility for security was an important part of the message of last week’s Dreamforce, but discussion of the Salesloft incident was conspicuously missing — a loss for attendees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because if anything can be taken away from the past few months of Salesforce-related cybersecurity, it’s that software supply-chain security is more important than ever. And it will only increase in importance as more systems get connected — a key tenet of &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4066640/salesforce-trusted-ai-foundation-provides-scaffolding-for-the-agentic-enterprise.html"&gt;Salesforce’s aim to power the agentic enterprise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Software supply-chain security is already not so easy to achieve, and, even as Salesforce promises to make this easier with the help of AI, it is AI itself that will make the problem that much harder to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
