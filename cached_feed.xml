      <title>TigerJack’s malicious VSCode extensions mine, steal, and stay hidden</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072829/tigerjacks-malicious-vscode-extensions-mine-steal-and-stay-hidden.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new disclosure, security researchers revealed that a threat actor group called TigerJack has been publishing malicious extensions on Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Marketplace and the OpenVSX registry to steal source code, plant cryptominers, and maintain remote access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Koi Security’s findings, two of the campaign’s popular extensions – “C++ Payground” and “HTTP Format” – were removed after accumulating over 17,000 downloads, but the operation continues through re-uploads under fresh accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These extensions remain fully operational in the OpenVSX marketplace (used by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4054796/cursors-autorun-lets-hackers-execute-arbitrary-code.html"&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt;, Windsurf, and other VS Code-compatible IDEs), continuing to steal code and mine cryptocurrency months after their removal from Microsoft’s platform,” Koi researchers said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have flagged it to be a coordinated campaign spanning at least 11 extensions across 3 different publisher accounts (ab-498,498 and 498-00).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Trojanized extensions built for persistence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koi’s analysis shows that each malicious extension serves a distinct role in TigerJack’s campaign. One version quietly uploads a developer’s source code to external endpoints, another uses local resources for cryptomining, and the most “sophisticated” variant can execute JavaScript remotely without needing fresh updates for expanding or changing functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aditya Sood, VP of Security Engineering and AI Strategy at Aryaka, thinks the last capability is particularly dangerous, allowing TigerJack to push payloads such as credential stealers, ransomware, or API-harvesting scripts at will, opening the door to long-term supply chain compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the core payload execution is often handled via dynamic, remote JavaScript, rather than by shipping updated binaries, the extension’s visible version remains unchanged, making detection by static scanners or vetting systems far more difficult, researchers added. In some cases, the malicious packaging is cleverly designed with the extensions masquerading as legitimate or popular tools that attackers even silently installed (on top of the malicious functionality) to avoid suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In essence, the campaign blends two capabilities, cryptomining and persistent backdoor control. In the mining variants, the extension deploys a miner that quietly consumes CPU (and sometimes GPU) cycles on developer machines, abusing the host’s processing power into illicit cryptocurrency generation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="coordinated-multi-account-operation"&gt;Coordinated multi-account operation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koi researchers found 11 extensions across multiple accounts, making it a coordinated operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This multi-account strategy provides redundancy when one account gets flagged, creates the illusion of independent developers, and demonstrates professional-level social engineering: GitHub repositories for credibility, consistent branding across extensions, detailed feature lists, professional marketplace presentations, and strategic naming that mimics legitimate tools (cppformat, pythonformat, httpformat),” the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.koi.ai/blog/tiger-jack-malicious-vscode-extensions-stealing-code" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis traced the malicious GitHub accounts back to a Facebook profile under the name “Zubaer Ahmed,” pointing to a likely operational slip that exposed the attacker’s real identity. The profile has since been taken down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For developers and organizations relying heavily on &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3956464/warning-to-developers-stay-away-from-these-10-vscode-extensions.html"&gt;VSCod&lt;/a&gt;e or OpenVSX, the extensions could compromise not just a codebase but entire build environments or deployment pipelines, Sood noted. Compromised extensions can silently exfiltrate or tamper with source code that later moves into production, effectively turning VSCode into a vector for software supply-chain attacks. In collaborative environments, a single infected deployment could compromise shared repositories or inject backdoors into dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Koi researchers emphasized that TigerJack’s re-emergence reveals a deeper weakness in the extension ecosystem, with developer tools still relying on reputation and user ratings, rather than code auditing or signed binaries. “OpenVSX and other alternative marketplaces appear to have virtually no security detection mechanisms in place,” they said. “While Microsoft eventually identifies threats after months of damage, these platforms operate with minimal or no malware scanning whatsoever.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individuals using either of the impacted platforms should vet their extensions thoroughly and only download packages from reputable sources, Sood added. “Additionally, users should implement security measures that can raise alarms about potential vulnerabilities so users have the opportunity to close them before they’re exploited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing MAESTRO: A framework for securing generative and agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072341/introducing-maestro-a-framework-for-securing-generative-and-agentic-ai.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at a pace that outstrips traditional security frameworks. Generative AI has already changed how financial institutions analyze data, create insights and engage with customers. The next frontier, agentic AI, is even more transformative. These systems can reason, plan and act autonomously, interacting with APIs, orchestrating workflows and even collaborating with other agents across payment gateways, credit systems and fraud detection platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While frameworks like MITRE ATLAS/ATT&amp;amp;CK, the OWASP LLM Top 10, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and ISO/IEC 23894 provide valuable guidance, they were not designed to address the systemic risks and emergent behaviors unique to multi-agent AI ecosystems in highly regulated sectors like banking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) introduced &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/02/06/agentic-ai-threat-modeling-framework-maestro" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat, Risk and Outcome)&lt;/a&gt; in 2025. This article provides a deep dive into MAESTRO, what it is, how to apply it in your organization and how it strengthens resilience in business services using banking industry scenarios. In future articles, we will explore how MAESTRO complements MITRE, OWASP, NIST and ISO for a comprehensive AI risk program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="scope-assumptions-and-boundaries"&gt;Scope, assumptions and boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before applying MAESTRO, it’s essential to clarify what it covers and what it does not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System boundary&lt;/strong&gt;: MAESTRO reviews focus on &lt;em&gt;models, AI agents, data flows, CI/CD pipelines, supporting tools and third-party APIs&lt;/em&gt;. Broader IT security hygiene (patching, identity governance, endpoint protection) is assumed to be managed by existing programs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;: organizations have the security baseline configurations and compliance, such as ISO 27XXX, in place. MAESTRO builds on these baselines and emphasizes &lt;em&gt;AI-specific risks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat actors&lt;/strong&gt;: The framework considers &lt;em&gt;external adversaries, malicious insiders, careless insiders and compromised suppliers&lt;/em&gt;. Each actor may target different layers of the AI stack in an organizational context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This scoping ensures MAESTRO is applied where it is most impactful: securing the AI-driven systems at the heart of modern banking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="minimum-viable-controls"&gt;Minimum viable controls&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Businesses should ask: &lt;em&gt;What do we need to implement first?&lt;/em&gt; MAESTRO can be phased in, but a baseline set of controls per layer provides immediate value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;div class="overflow-table-wrapper"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum Specific Controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Input/output validation for chatbots, deny-by-default for API tool use, API key rotation, model provenance verification to prevent tampered LLMs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;End-to-end transaction data lineage, signed datasets for regulatory reporting, schema validation at ingestion, anomaly detection on user behavior, card payments, data changes in the datasets, etc.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Per-agent RBAC tied to transaction type, scoped tokens for fraud detection and credit agents, allowlist of banking APIs (e.g., SWIFT, ACH), execution sandboxing for risky operations&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment &amp;amp; Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IaC scanning for different compliances, such as PCI-DSS, container image signing, egress restrictions for agents accessing APIs and least-privileged cloud service roles&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation &amp;amp; Observability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Prompt-injection test suites for banking chatbots, drift monitoring in credit scoring models, transaction anomaly alerts and regulatory explainability logging&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;amp; Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Controls mapped to Basel III, GDPR, PCI DSS, immutable audit trails for regulators and DLP policies applied to all model inputs/outputs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dependency inventory of third-party APIs, blast-radius limits for cross-agent failures, circuit breakers in payment processing flows and multi-agent simulations before deployment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is crucial to ensure there is a crystal clear, defined RACI table and everyone is briefed and aware of their roles and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To obtain a better understanding, we need to have a deep dive into the 7 layers of MAESTRO by leveraging threats and use cases in the banking sector:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-7-layers-of-maestro-in-banking"&gt;The 7 layers of MAESTRO in banking&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MAESTRO organizes AI risk into seven interdependent layers. In banking, each layer presents unique challenges and must be addressed systematically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-foundation-models-core-services"&gt;1. Foundation models/core services&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large language models power virtual assistants, fraud detection models and risk analytics in banks. Any manipulation at this level can undermine trust in the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Secure the LLMs and APIs underpinning AI services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Adversarial prompts alter model outputs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt;: A customer tricks a virtual banking assistant into disclosing loan approval criteria.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Input/output sanitization, API lifecycle management, watermarking of model responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-data-operations"&gt;2. Data operations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transaction, payment and credit data are the lifeblood of banking AI. Compromised data pipelines can poison decision-making and regulatory reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Safeguard the integrity and provenance of banking data pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Poisoned transaction records bias loan decisions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt;: Attackers inject fake payment histories to secure unauthorized loans.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt; Include Data lineage, signed datasets and anomaly detection for unusual transaction flows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-agent-frameworks-application-logic"&gt;3. Agent frameworks/application logic&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banks deploy AI agents for fraud monitoring, payment approvals and customer service. Without strict controls, these agents can be misused or over-privileged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Secure orchestration and business logic in AI agents.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Prompt injection disables fraud monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt;: A fraud detection agent is tricked into ignoring suspicious transactions during dispute resolution.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Per-agent RBAC, scoped tokens, allowlisted API usage and sandboxing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-deployment-infrastructure"&gt;4. Deployment &amp;amp; infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI in could be deployed across hybrid cloud and containerized environments, creating opportunities for supply chain attacks and misconfigurations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Secure runtime environments and CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Compromised container images in deployment pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt;: Backdoored fraud detection images are deployed through an unscanned pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: IaC scanning for PCI compliance, container image signing and hardened Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-evaluation-observability"&gt;5. Evaluation &amp;amp; observability&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banking AI must remain accurate, explainable and compliant. Continuous monitoring ensures that models don’t drift into unsafe or discriminatory behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Track AI system health and behavior over time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Credit scoring model drifts, approving risky borrowers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt;: Unmonitored drift leads to regulatory penalties for biased lending.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Drift monitoring, explainability logging, anomaly detection on credit decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-security-compliance"&gt;6. Security &amp;amp; compliance&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banking is one of the most regulated industries. AI must align with global standards like Basel III, PCI DSS, GDPR and the EU AI Act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure regulatory alignment and enterprise security policy enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Unauthorized data leakage in AI responses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case&lt;/strong&gt;: A banking chatbot reveals customer account data to the wrong user.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Immutable audit logs, DLP enforcement, redaction guardrails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-agent-ecosystem"&gt;7. Agent ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Banks operate in complex ecosystems with multiple AI agents coordinating across payment networks, partners and fintech APIs. Risks at this layer are systemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: Manage systemic risks across agent interactions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example threat&lt;/strong&gt;: Feedback loops between payment and fraud agents.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use case:&lt;/strong&gt; A fraud agent incorrectly blocks all ACH transactions, halting operations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controls&lt;/strong&gt;: Trust boundaries, multi-agent simulations, circuit breakers for payment systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="use-cases-in-practice-banking"&gt;Use cases in practice (Banking)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-credit-scoring-and-loan-approvals"&gt;1. Credit scoring and loan approvals&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A loan approval model is poisoned by manipulated transaction histories, resulting in biased or inaccurate credit decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt;: Data Operations, Evaluation &amp;amp; Observability, Security &amp;amp; Compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Signed datasets, drift monitoring and regulatory explainability requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-fraud-detection-systems"&gt;2. Fraud detection systems&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fraud models are manipulated by adversarial data, causing missed fraud alerts or false positives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt;: Foundation Models, Agent Frameworks, Deployment &amp;amp; Infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Input validation, scoped agent RBAC and container signing in pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-conversational-banking-assistants"&gt;3. Conversational banking assistants&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virtual assistants are tricked into disclosing sensitive account information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt;: Foundation Models, Security &amp;amp; Compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Input/output sanitization, DLP policies, compliance guardrails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-payment-processing-and-transaction-flows"&gt;4. Payment processing and transaction flows&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI agents managing transactions create a feedback loop, freezing legitimate payments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt;: Agent Ecosystem, Agent Frameworks, Evaluation &amp;amp; Observability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Circuit breakers, trust boundaries and simulation of agent interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-regulatory-compliance-reporting"&gt;5. Regulatory compliance reporting&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI systems generating regulatory reports drift over time, producing inaccurate filings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt;: Evaluation &amp;amp; Observability, Security &amp;amp; Compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Continuous monitoring, immutable audit logs, anomaly detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;div class="overflow-table-wrapper"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAESTRO Layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Threat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking Use Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation Models / Core Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Adversarial prompts alter outputs&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Virtual assistant tricked into revealing loan approval rules&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Input/output sanitization, API lifecycle mgmt., model watermarking&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Poisoned transaction data&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fake payment histories bias credit scoring&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Data lineage, signed datasets, anomaly detection, schema validation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent Frameworks / Application Logic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Prompt injection disables fraud monitoring&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fraud detection agent ignores suspicious transactions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Per-agent RBAC, scoped tokens, allowlisted APIs and sandboxing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment &amp;amp; Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Compromised container images&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Backdoored fraud detection models deployed via CI/CD&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IaC scanning (PCI), image signing, hardened Kubernetes, egress restrictions&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation &amp;amp; Observability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Model drift degrades performance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The credit scoring model starts approving risky borrowers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Drift monitoring, anomaly alerts, explainability logs, test harnesses&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;amp; Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Unauthorized data leakage&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Chatbot exposes customer account info&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Immutable audit logs, DLP enforcement, automated redaction, compliance guardrails&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feedback loops disrupt workflows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fraud and payment agents block legitimate ACH transfers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Trust boundaries, dependency mapping, circuit breakers and pre-production simulations&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure threat modeling for the AI could be hosted within the on-prem or cloud environment or a SaaS service should be assessed separately as well&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-foundation-for-systemic-ai-security"&gt;A foundation for systemic AI security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI in organizations is no longer experimental. With agentic AI, organizations face autonomy, unpredictability and systemic risks that traditional frameworks cannot fully address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MAESTRO provides a structured, layered, outcome-driven framework tailored to these realities. By applying it across data, models, infrastructure and ecosystems, organizations can secure and enhance the efficiency, cost and security and resiliency of their businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While frameworks like MITRE, OWASP, NIST and ISO add tactical and governance layers, MAESTRO serves as the foundation for systemic AI security in banking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flax Typhoon exploited ArcGIS to gain long-term access</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072876/flax-typhoon-exploited-arcgis-to-gain-long-term-access.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An advanced persistent threat (APT) group, Flax Typhoon, was able to gain persistent access to the mapping tool ArcGIS for over a year, putting several enterprises at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ArcGIS is a geospatial platform developed by ESRI, often relied upon by organizations to understand and analyze data in a geographic context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China-based Flax Typhoon, also known as Ethereal Panda, modified the geo-mapping application’s Java server object extension (SOE) into a functioning web shell, according to new research from ReliaQuest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3631635/us-government-sanctions-chinese-cybersecurity-company-linked-to-apt-group.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;Flax Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; had gated access with a hardcoded key for exclusive control and embedded it in system backups. This helped the actor in achieving deep, long-term persistence that could survive a full system recovery. It prioritized persistence, lateral movement, and credential harvesting, typically gaining initial access by exploiting public-facing servers, deploying web shells, and establishing VPN connections, noted the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The tactics are getting more sophisticated in compromising and manipulating trusted components or tools such as PowerShell or custom SoEs or public-facing portal connects instead of building and injecting a malware,” said Neil Shah, vice president at Counterpoint Research. “This could thus go undetected as there is some form of already established baseline or higher level of trust regarding security and is whitelisted by enterprises with onus on the application or tool developer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="turning-arcgis-into-a-web-shell"&gt;Turning ArcGIS into a web shell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The activity began with modifying an ArcGIS server SOE to behave as a web shell, ReliaQuest &lt;a href="https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-inside-flax-typhoons-arcgis-compromise/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. The attackers found a public-facing ArcGIS server that was connected to a private, internal ArcGIS server for backend computations (a common default configuration). It then executes base64-encoded (disguised) commands to the portal server, consistent with this proxying model.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For initial execution, actors sent a malicious GET web request with a base64-encoded payload in the layer parameter. Decoded, it resolved to “cmd.exe /c mkdir C:\Windows\System32\Bridge,” instructing the server to create a hidden system directory named Bridge. This serves as a private workspace for the attackers. A hardcoded key was appended to the request, which was required to trigger the web shell and execute commands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was followed by repeatedly abusing this same web shell to run additional encoded PowerShell commands, routed through the same “JavaSimpleRESTSOE” extension and “getLayerCountByType” operation. This consistent method allowed them to advance their objectives while blending in with normal server traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Learning the web shell worked, the threat actor used discovery commands like “whoami” to discover the compromised service account with local administrator rights and created new directories to serve as a staging area for the tools they would use later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Activity was ramped up by scanning the internal network over various protocols, including &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3966334/public-exploits-already-available-for-a-severity-10-erlang-ssh-vulnerability-patch-now.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;Secure Shell (SSH)&lt;/a&gt;, HTTPS, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3623709/nail-the-software-setup-and-avoid-attacks-with-the-top-10-cybersecurity-misconfiguration-list.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;Server Message Block (SMB)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4037515/win-ddos-researchers-unveil-botnet-technique-exploiting-windows-domain-controllers.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;Remote Procedure Call (RPC)&lt;/a&gt;, and conducting several SMB scans across different internal subnets. Next, to establish long-term access, the renamed SoftEther VPN executable “bridge.exe” was uploaded into the default Windows System32 directory, which reduced the chances of detection. The malicious SOE also provided ongoing access, and given that it was on the ArcGIS server for an extended period, it was stored in the victim’s backups as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-is-at-risk"&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first documented case confirmed by ArcGIS, where the malicious SOE was used, ReliaQuest identified that the password for the ArcGIS portal administrator account was a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/547462/microsoft-subnet-hackers-use-pathetic-passwords-just-like-everyone-else.html"&gt;leet password&lt;/a&gt; of unknown origin, suggesting that the attacker had access to the administrative account and was able to reset the password.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any organization that uses ArcGIS in a networked environment, if it is exposed externally or to other enterprise data systems, is at risk,” said Devroop Dhar, co-founder and MD at Primus Partners. “The main risk is that attackers can use a compromised extension to maintain access and take out sensitive data. As ArcGIS is widely used in mapping, logistics, and public-sector planning, the data it has can be sensitive, like network maps, population records, and infrastructure layouts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, for most enterprises, the concern is not just immediate disruption but also silent observation. If an attacker sits inside a system that tracks infrastructure or logistics, that is a serious intelligence advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To verify if compromised, organizations should start by taking a complete inventory of all ArcGIS Server versions in their environment and enumerating every Server Object Extension (SOE) and Server Object Interceptor (SOI) in use,” said Amit Jaju, senior managing director – India at Ankura Consulting. “Then they should compare these against known source and vendor hash values to detect unauthorized changes. Conduct a detailed hunt for any anomalous SOE JAR files or class structures, hardcoded tokens or encryption keys, suspicious admin activity logs, and web shell indicators identified by security researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaju added that CISOs should not overlook backups or AMIs, and verify that they aren’t seeded with malicious SOEs and confirm the integrity of your golden images.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For remediation, immediately isolate affected ArcGIS servers, rotate all related service accounts and secrets, and apply strict least-privilege controls to ArcGIS service identities. “Rebuild compromised systems only from known-good media, redeploying extensions that are both signed and independently reviewed. Where possible, enforce code-signing validation for all SOEs to prevent tampering. Finally, strengthen your monitoring posture, add detections specifically for SOE abuse and abnormal ArcGIS administrative endpoint activity, and diversify your threat intelligence sources by subscribing to multiple feeds rather than relying solely on KEV,” added Jaju.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="trusted-software-is-the-new-attack-surface"&gt;Trusted software is the new attack surface&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security analysts say that the Flax Typhoon case highlights a worrying evolution in the weaponization of trusted components rather than the deployment of conventional malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the same group targeted dozens of organizations in Taiwan with the likely intention of performing espionage, reported  &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/08/24/flax-typhoon-using-legitimate-software-to-quietly-access-taiwanese-organizations/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, SolarWinds was targeted by hackers. They deployed malicious code into &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570191/solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-explained-why-organizations-were-not-prepared.html"&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; Orion IT monitoring and management software that was used by thousands of enterprises and government agencies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/575125/3cx-hack-highlights-risk-of-cascading-software-supply-chain-compromises.html"&gt;3CX&lt;/a&gt; suffered a serious software supply-chain compromise that resulted in both its Windows and macOS applications being poisoned with malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to experts, threat actors have realized that compromising a trusted vendor module gives them free access. As a result, vendor software should not be treated as safe by default. “Trusted platforms also need continuous verification. Regular code-integrity checks, tighter monitoring of vendor updates, and periodic pen testing of integrated systems are essential,” added Dhar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should also push vendors to provide transparency and clarity, like SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials), details of their own security testing and disclosure protocols, Dhar said. “It is also important to separate privileges; just because a module comes from a trusted vendor does not mean it needs access to everything in the network.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using AI efficiently to real-time monitor any anomaly in behavioral analytics, comparing with a longish history rather than a slice in time is critical added Shah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>MCPTotal Launches to Power Secure Enterprise MCP Workflows</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072584/mcptotal-launches-to-power-secure-enterprise-mcp-workflows.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.mcptotal.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCPTotal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a comprehensive secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) platform, today announced its flagship platform to help businesses adopt and secure MCP servers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MCP has become the standard interface for connecting AI models with enterprise systems, external data sources, and third-party applications. But, uncontrolled adoption has introduced major risks, including supply chain exposures, prompt injection vulnerabilities, rogue MCP servers, data exfiltration, and authentication gaps. Both traditional security products and newer LLM security solutions are not able to monitor MCP traffic, leaving enterprises exposed to new opportunities for bad actors. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MCPTotal delivers the first end-to-end platform for organizations to safely adopt MCPs while also improving their usability. Its hub-and-gateway architecture provides centralized hosting, authentication and credential vaulting while acting as an AI-native firewall to monitor traffic and enforce policies in real time. MCPTotal offers hundreds of secure MCP servers in its vetted catalog, allowing enterprise users to select from a safe and secure range. With MCPTotal, employees can connect their AI models to business-critical systems like Slack and Gmail, while security leaders get full visibility into usage and enforcement via guardrails to ensure security, privacy, and compliance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCPTotal&lt;/strong&gt; delivers four key capabilities unmatched in the market: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enablement, not restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Empowers all employees to use MCP immediately through a simple, intuitive experience with built-in policy enforcement and auditing that keep security teams in control. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Security Review:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures only trusted, curated MCP servers are available, each passing a rigorous security vetting process to eliminate malicious risks. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Visibility Scans:&lt;/strong&gt; Offers flexible methods to scan employee workstations and detect MCP-related risks or threats across the organization. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Environment Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Operates consistently across desktop, browser, and cloud environments, including self-hosted deployments. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Until now, there hasn’t been a solution that can help security teams actually lock down MCP servers at the rate that employees are connecting their AI and business applications via MCP,” said Gil Dabah, CEO of MCPTotal. “In fact, the first malicious MCP server in the wild was just reported, demonstrating how easily attackers can get into enterprise sensitive data. Now with MCPTotal, we’re giving organizations the ability to securely host, monitor and sandbox servers so employees can safely use MCPs and connect them to any data source without manually handling API keys.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform enables enterprises to finally adopt MCPs without adopting more shadow IT risk. With MCPTotal’s easy to use interface, employees are not required to be developers or technical experts to leverage MCPs in their workflows. Security teams are able to set policies around MCP usage and users are able to access pre-vetted MCP servers via single sign-on and gain access to all their authenticated tools. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About MCPTotal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.mcptotal.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MCPTotal&lt;/a&gt; provides enterprise-grade MCP infrastructure with built-in security, governance and compliance controls. Founded by serial entrepreneurs and security experts Gil Dabah and Dr. Ariel Shiftan, the company helps organizations safely harness the power of AI-tool integration.

      <title>Source code and vulnerability info stolen from F5 Networks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4073195/source-code-and-vulnerability-info-stolen-from-f5-networks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs with equipment from F5 Networks in their environment should patch their devices immediately and be alert for suspicious activity after &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048695/000104869525000149/ffiv-20251015.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company acknowledged in a regulatory filing today&lt;/a&gt; that an unnamed threat actor stole some source code for its BIG-IP products earlier this year, as well as information on undisclosed vulnerabilities and device configuration data for a “small percentage of customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the disclosure, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-26-01-mitigate-vulnerabilities-f5-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today directed &lt;/a&gt;federal civilian agencies to evaluate whether their BIG-IP devices are accessible from the public internet, and to apply updates from F5.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This cyber threat actor presents an imminent threat to federal networks using F5 devices and software,” says the CISA warning. “Successful exploitation of the impacted F5 products could enable a threat actor to access embedded credentials and Application Programming Interface (API) keys, move laterally within an organization’s network, exfiltrate data, and establish persistent system access. This could potentially lead to a full compromise of target information systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;F5 has released updates&lt;/a&gt; for BIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IP Next for Kubernetes, BIG-IQ, and APM clients. “We strongly advise updating to these new releases as soon as possible,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;F5, which is known for its application delivery and security products, including web gateways and access control management, turned down an interview request for more details, instead referring a reporter to &lt;a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000154696" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-was-taken"&gt;What was taken&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the statement, F5 said the threat actor exfiltrated files from the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platforms. “These files contained some of our BIG-IP source code and information about undisclosed vulnerabilities we were working on in BIG-IP. We have no knowledge of undisclosed critical or remote code vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of active exploitation of any undisclosed F5 vulnerabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, it said, there is no evidence of access to, or exfiltration of, data from F5’s customer relationship management, financial, support case management, or iHealth systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However,” the statement added, “some of the exfiltrated files from our knowledge management platform contained configuration or implementation information for a small percentage of customers. We are currently reviewing these files and will be communicating with affected customers directly as appropriate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It continued, “We have no evidence of modification to our software supply chain, including our source code and our build and release pipelines. This assessment has been validated through independent reviews by cybersecurity research firms NCC Group and IOActive. There is no evidence the threat actor accessed or modified the NGINX source code or product development environment. NGINX is an open source web server for reverse proxy, load balancing and caching  nor is there evidence they accessed or modified the F5 Distributed Cloud Services or Silverline systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;F5 attributes the attack to a “highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor.” It did not reveal how long the hacker was active in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As to why the revelation of the attack is coming out today, in its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048695/000104869525000149/ffiv-20251015.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disclosure to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;, F5 said that on September 12, the US Justice Department determined a delay in public disclosure was warranted. Critical network devices like firewalls, web gateways, email gateways and similar devices have long been targets for threat actors as entry points to IT networks, as illustrated by the recent disclosure by SonicWall that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072194/sonicwall-vpns-face-a-breach-of-their-own-after-the-september-cloud-backup-fallout.html" target="_blank"&gt;data from its MySonicWall cloud backup platform had been compromised&lt;/a&gt;, and last month’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-25-03-identify-and-mitigate-potential-compromise-cisco-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CISA warning&lt;/a&gt; that threat actors were targeting Cisco Systems’ Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="f5-mitigations"&gt;F5 mitigations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT and security leaders should make sure F5 servers, software, and clients have the latest patches. In addition, F5 has added automated hardening checks to the F5 iHealth Diagnostics Tool, and also suggests admins refer to its threat hunting guide to strengthen monitoring, and its best practices guides for hardening F5 systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of the attack, F5 said it has rotated credentials and strengthened access controls across its systems; deployed improved inventory and patch management automation, as well as additional tooling to better monitor, detect, and respond to threats; implemented enhancements to its network security architecture and hardened its product development environment, including strengthening security controls and monitoring of all software development platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;F5 will also provide all supported customers with a free subscription to CrowdStrike’s Falcon EDR endpoint protection service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stolen-info-could-feed-future-attacks"&gt;Stolen info could feed future attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Based on the currently disclosed information about the scope of the incident and stolen data, there is no reason to panic,” commented &lt;a href="https://www.immuniweb.com/company/leadership/ilia-kolochenko/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ilia Kolochenko&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of ImmuniWeb, in a statement. “Having said this, stolen source code can greatly simplify vulnerability research by the cybercriminals behind the breach and facilitate detection of 0day vulnerabilities in the affected F5 products, which may be exploited in subsequent APT attacks. Likewise, the reportedly small percentage of customers whose technical information was compromised should urgently assess their risks and continue working with F5 to better understand the impact of the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This attack is another reminder that the modern attack surface extends deep into the software development lifecycle, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-baxter-1b350611/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Will Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, field CISO at Team Cymru, said in a statement. “Threat groups targeting source code repositories and build environments are seeking long-term intelligence value—understanding how security controls operate from the inside,” he said. “Visibility into outbound connections, threat actor command-and-control infrastructure, and unusual data exfiltration patterns is key to identifying this activity early. Combining external threat intelligence with internal telemetry gives defenders the context needed to detect and contain these advanced intrusions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t an opportunistic exploitation, he added. “It was about gaining insight into code and vulnerabilities before disclosure. State-sponsored groups increasingly view source repositories and engineering systems as strategic intelligence targets. Early detection depends on monitoring outbound connections, command-and-control traffic, and unusual data flows from developer and build environments. Combining external threat intelligence with internal telemetry gives defenders the context to identify and contain these campaigns before the stolen code is turned into zero-days.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The F5 incident is serious due to the attacker’s extended access to the systems, &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute, told &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Online&lt;/em&gt;. “According to the statements made by F5, the amount of customer data leaked is very limited,” he noted. “However, it is not clear yet how far F5 is in their incident response, and how certain they are that they have accurately identified the attacker’s impact. Having lost source code and information about unpatched vulnerabilities could lead to an increase in attacks against F5 systems in the near future. Follow F5’s hardening advice and, just as a measure of caution, review and possibly change credentials.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>58% of CISOs are boosting AI security budgets</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072868/58-of-cisos-are-boosting-ai-security-budgets.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is no longer an experiment in the security stack — it’s becoming the centerpiece. Foundry’s 2025 Security Priorities Study finds that 58% of organizations plan to boost spending on AI-enabled security tools next year, signaling a decisive shift from curiosity to commitment. And it’s not just budgets following the trend. The research finds 93% say they’re already using or are actively researching using AI in their security technologies over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The urgency makes sense. CISOs are watching attackers weaponize generative AI to automate phishing, create deepfakes, and craft more convincing social engineering campaigns. In response, they’re turning to agentic and generative AI to harden defenses, augment analysts, and improve resilience at scale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Orgs researching AI security tools" class="wp-image-4073134" height="540" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/using-AI-security-tools.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming &lt;a href="https://event.foundryco.com/cso-conference-awards/"&gt;CSO Conference&lt;/a&gt;, IDC’s Frank Dickson will examine this trend in his session, “Insights from IDC’s Latest Security Research.” He’ll explore how AI is reshaping cybersecurity strategy — not as a bolt-on tool, but as a fundamental shift in how organizations detect, respond, and adapt to risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4064158/agentic-ai-in-it-security-where-expectations-meet-reality.html"&gt;CSO reporting&lt;/a&gt; shows what that evolution looks like in practice. Early adopters describe how intelligent agents are already handling tier-one SOC tasks such as alert triage, log correlation, and first-line containment, freeing analysts for higher-level investigations. Others &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4049485/5-ways-cisos-are-experimenting-with-ai.html"&gt;are using AI&lt;/a&gt; to prioritize vulnerabilities, analyze threat intelligence in real time, and even draft reports and risk summaries for executive audiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as adoption accelerates, so does the need for governance. Many security leaders are discovering that deploying AI responsibly requires new controls, from audit trails and human-in-the-loop oversight to transparency into model decisions. In other words, the same technology transforming the SOC also demands fresh thinking about accountability, data quality, and risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, most CISOs agree the upside outweighs the risk. Experts &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042494/how-ai-is-reshaping-cybersecurity-operations.html"&gt;describe AI as a “force multiplier for the defense,”&lt;/a&gt; enabling smaller teams to handle larger workloads and react faster than ever. The Security Priorities research echoes that sentiment, showing AI-driven cybersecurity is now a top-tier investment priority — not a future experiment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spending on AI-enabled security" class="wp-image-4073133" height="540" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AI-spending-12-months.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The takeaway: AI in cybersecurity has reached an inflection point. Whether it’s accelerating incident response, tightening identity management, or simplifying complex threat analysis, enterprises are betting big that AI-enabled tools will be essential for staying secure in an era of AI-enabled attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CSO Security Priorities study for 2025 will be presented during a discussion at the annual CSO Conference &amp;amp; Awards, October 20–22 at the Grand Hyatt Indian Wells.  Join IDC’s Frank Dickson and leading CISOs as they share real-world lessons on where AI delivers results and how to deploy it responsibly in the fight against today’s evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Critical ASP.NET core vulnerability earns Microsoft’s highest-ever severity score</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074590/critical-asp-net-core-vulnerability-earns-microsofts-highest-ever-severity-score.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has patched a critical vulnerability in ASP.NET Core that earned a CVSS severity score of 9.9, the highest rating the company has ever assigned to a flaw in the web development framework.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability, tracked as &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55315" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-55315&lt;/a&gt;, affects the Kestrel web server component built into ASP.NET Core and could allow authenticated attackers to bypass security features through HTTP request smuggling, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3403054914" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company said in a security advisory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Inconsistent interpretation of http requests (‘http request/response smuggling’) in ASP.NET Core allows an authorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network,” the advisory stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flaw impacts all currently supported versions of ASP.NET Core, including versions 8, 9, and 10, as well as the older ASP.NET Core 2.3 that runs on the Windows-only .NET Framework.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-attackers-could-do"&gt;What attackers could do&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability centers on request smuggling attacks, which exploit how web servers and applications interpret HTTP requests. An attacker can hide a malicious second request inside what appears to be a legitimate first request, potentially allowing actions that would normally require authentication to be performed without proper authorization, the advisory added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barry Dorrans, Microsoft’s security program manager for ASP.NET Core, said in the GitHub advisory that the smuggled request could perform various malicious actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An attacker could use this vulnerability to log in as a different user, bypass cross-site request forgery checks, or perform injection attacks,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Dorrans emphasized that the actual risk depends heavily on how applications are written and deployed. Bad outcomes are unlikely “unless your application code is doing something odd and skips a bunch of checks it ought to be making on every request,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-cvss-confusion"&gt;The CVSS confusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite Dorrans’ cautious assessment of the actual risk, the 9.9 CVSS rating has caused considerable confusion among developers, with many questioning whether the vulnerability truly warrants such an extreme severity score.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dorrans addressed this directly in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3403054914" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GitHub discussion&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that Microsoft’s scoring methodology accounts for worst-case scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On its own for ASP.NET Core,” he wrote, the rating would be “nowhere near that high.” But Microsoft scores vulnerabilities based on the potential for “a security feature bypass which changes scope,” meaning the attack could affect components beyond the initially vulnerable one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When developers asked for specifics about what application code patterns might be vulnerable, Dorrans offered cautious responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anything that does something with a request could be problematic,” he said, adding that “an app that does authentication and has access rules based on the authentication may be vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He, however, noted that these were personal observations rather than official Microsoft guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-needs-to-patch"&gt;Who needs to patch?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability affects a wide range of ASP.NET Core versions. Any application running ASP.NET Core 10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107 or earlier, ASP.NET Core 9.0.9 or earlier, ASP.NET Core 8.0.20 or earlier, or ASP.NET Core 2.x with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Core version 2.3.0 or earlier is susceptible to the flaw, according to the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations face different patching requirements depending on their deployment model. Applications using framework-dependent deployments rely on the .NET runtime installed on the server, meaning administrators must update the server itself. Those using self-contained deployments, which bundle the runtime with the application, must rebuild and redeploy each affected application individually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released patched versions across all supported releases. Developers should upgrade to .NET 8.0.21 Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK for version 8, .NET 9.0.10 Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK for version 9, or .NET 10.0.0-rc.2.25476.107 Runtime for the version 10 pre-release, the advisory said. For legacy ASP.NET Core 2.x applications, Microsoft released Kestrel.Core package version 2.3.6 through NuGet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="some-may-already-be-protected"&gt;Some may already be protected&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all organizations may need to take immediate action, however. One mitigating factor is that applications protected by reverse proxies or API gateways may already have adequate defenses, Dorrans said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If a gateway or proxy removes smuggled requests, the application is protected,” he wrote. However, Kestrel implementations that directly face the internet without such intermediary filtering remain vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-55315" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stated in its official update guide&lt;/a&gt; that the vulnerability is not known to be exploited in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Dorrans advised that organizations should evaluate their specific risks carefully. “Only you can evaluate the risks to your application,” he wrote, while recommending that “the cautious approach is to patch as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Coming AI regulations have IT leaders worried about hefty compliance fines</title>
      <link>https://www.cio.com/article/4072396</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than seven in 10 IT leaders are worried about their organizations’ ability to keep up with regulatory requirements as they deploy generative AI, with many concerned about a potential patchwork of regulations on the way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 70% of IT leaders named regulatory compliance as one of their top three challenges related to gen AI deployment, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-06-gartner-predicts-ai-regulatory-violations-will-result-in-a-30-percent-increase-in-legal-disputes-for-tech-companies-by-2028"&gt;recent survey from Gartner&lt;/a&gt;. Less than a quarter of those IT leaders are very confident that their organizations can manage security and governance issues, including regulatory compliance, when using gen AI, the survey says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT leaders appear to be worried about complying with the potential for a growing number of AI regulations, including some that may conflict with one another, says &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/experts/lydia-cloughertyjones"&gt;Lydia Clougherty Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a senior director analyst at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The number of legal nuances, especially for a global organization, can be overwhelming, because the frameworks that are being announced by the different countries vary widely,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gartner predicts that AI regulatory violations will create a 30% increase in legal disputes for tech companies by 2028. By mid-2026, new categories of illegal AI-informed decision-making will cost more than $10 billion in remediation costs across AI vendors and users, the analyst firm also projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="just-the-start"&gt;Just the start&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Government efforts to regulate AI are likely in their infancy, with the &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/news-and-media/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en"&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/a&gt;, which went into effect in August 2024, one of the first major pieces of legislation targeting the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the US Congress has so far taken a hands-off approach, a handful of US states have passed AI regulations, with the 2024 &lt;a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/fpf_legislation_policy_brief_the_colorado_ai_act_final.pdf"&gt;Colorado AI Act&lt;/a&gt; requiring AI users to maintain risk management programs and conduct impact assessments and requiring both vendors and users to protect consumers from algorithmic discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas has also passed its own AI law, which goes into effect in January 2026. The Texas &lt;a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/insights/publications/2025/06/texas-adopts-the-responsible-ai-governance-act"&gt;Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act&lt;/a&gt; (TRAIGA) requires government entities to inform individuals when they are interacting with an AI. The law also prohibits using AI to manipulate human behavior, such as inciting self-harm, or engaging in illegal activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Texas law includes &lt;a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/traiga-key-provisions-texas-new-artificial-intelligence-governance-act"&gt;civil penalties&lt;/a&gt; of up to $200,000 per violation or $40,000 per day for ongoing violations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, in late September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/"&gt;Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act&lt;/a&gt;, which requires large AI developers to publish descriptions on how they have incorporated national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices into their AI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The California law, which also goes into effect in January 2026, also mandates that AI companies report critical safety incidents, including cyberattacks, within 15 days, and provides provisions to protect whistleblowers who report violations of the law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies that fail to comply with the disclosure and reporting requirements face fines of up to $1 million per violation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;California IT regulations have an outsize impact on global practices because the state’s population of about 39 million gives it a huge number of potential AI customers protected under the law.  California’s population is larger than more than 135 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;California also is the AI capital of the world, containing the headquarters of &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/"&gt;32 of the top 50&lt;/a&gt; AI companies worldwide, including OpenAI, Databricks, Anthropic, and Perplexity AI. All AI providers doing business in California will be subject to the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cios-on-the-forefront"&gt;CIOs on the forefront&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With US states and more countries potentially passing AI regulations, CIOs are understandably nervous about compliance as they deploy the technology, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhinchcliffe"&gt;Dion Hinchcliffe&lt;/a&gt;, vice president and practice lead for digital leadership and CIOs, at market intelligence firm Futurum Equities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The CIO is on the hook to make it actually work, so they’re the ones really paying very close attention to what is possible,” he says. “They’re asking, ‘How accurate are these things? How much can data be trusted?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some AI regulatory and governance compliance solutions exist, some CIOs fear that those tools won’t keep up with the ever-changing regulatory and AI functionality landscape, Hinchcliffe says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not clear that we have tools that will constantly and reliably manage the governance and the regulatory compliance issues, and it’ll maybe get worse, because regulations haven’t even arrived yet,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI regulatory compliance will be especially difficult because of the nature of the technology, he adds. “AI is so slippery,” Hinchcliffe says. “The technology is not deterministic; it’s probabilistic. AI works to solve all these problems that traditionally coded systems can’t because the coders never thought about that scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tina-joros-0ab53413/"&gt;Tina Joros&lt;/a&gt;, chairwoman of the Electronic Health Record Association AI Task Force, also sees concerns over compliance because of a fragmented regulatory landscape. The various regulations being passed could widen an already large digital divide between large health systems and their smaller and rural counterparts that are struggling to keep pace with AI adoption, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The various laws being enacted by states like California, Colorado, and Texas are creating a regulatory maze that’s challenging for health IT leaders and could have a chilling effect on the future development and use of generative AI,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even bills that don’t make it into law require careful analysis, because they could shape future regulatory expectations, Joros adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Confusion also arises because the relevant definitions included in those laws and regulations, such as ‘developer,’ ‘deployer,’ and ‘high risk,’ are frequently different, resulting in a level of industry uncertainty,” she says. “This understandably leads many software developers to sometimes pause or second-guess projects, as developers and healthcare providers want to ensure the tools they’re building now are compliant in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://contractpodai.com/news/leadership-team-expansion-leah-innovation/"&gt;James Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, chief AI officer at contract software provider ContractPodAi, agrees that the inconsistency and overlap between AI regulations creates problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For global enterprises, that fragmentation alone creates operational headaches — not because they’re unwilling to comply, but because each regulation defines concepts like transparency, usage, explainability, and accountability in slightly different ways,” he says. “What works in North America doesn’t always work across the EU.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="look-to-governance-tools"&gt;Look to governance tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thomas recommends that organizations adopt a suite of governance controls and systems as they deploy AI. In many cases, a major problem is that AI adoption has been driven by individual employees using personal productivity tools, creating a fragmented deployment approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While powerful for specific tasks, these tools were never designed for the complexities of regulated, enterprise-wide deployment,” he says. “They lack centralized governance, operate in silos, and make it nearly impossible to ensure consistency, track data provenance, or manage risk at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As IT leaders struggle with regulatory compliance, Gartner also recommends that the focus on training AI models to self-correct, create rigorous use-case review procedures, increase model testing and sandboxing, and deploy content moderation techniques such as buttons to report abuse AI warning labels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT leaders need to be able to defend their AI results, requiring a deep understanding of how the models work, says Gartner’s Clougherty Jones. In certain risk scenarios, this may mean using an external auditor to test the AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have to defend the data, you have to defend the model development, the model behavior, and then you have to defend the output,” she says. “A lot of times we use internal systems to audit output, but if something’s really high risk, why not get a neutral party to be able to audit it? If you’re defending the model and you’re the one who did the testing yourself, that’s defensible only so far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>There’s no such thing as quantum incident response – and that changes everything</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4073058/theres-no-such-thing-as-quantum-incident-response-and-that-changes-everything.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key elements to detecting cyberattacks is the concept of observability. We can literally see the packets of data being thrown towards a website when a DoS attack is taking place. The “boom” of the attack is visible and observable. But when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer is utilized to break into encrypted traffic flows, the attacker “snoops” the traffic and stores a copy somewhere else where it can be processed later with impunity, which makes the act both not observed and not observable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what I call the “silent boom,” and it will most definitely be a plate tectonic shift in the world of secrets and privacy, disrupting the balance of power for every nation, every industry and every individual.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evidence isn’t theoretical. According to network security firm Qrator Labs, &lt;a href="https://qrator.net/blog/details/q2-2024-ddos-bots-and-bgp-incidents-statistics-and" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there were approximately 13,626 BGP hijack attacks&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2024 and 13,438 in the third quarter. Not all are malicious, but enough create that “scenic route” through Chinese-owned or Russian-owned IP addresses that makes security professionals nervous about store-now-decrypt-later attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Marvel, we had secrets that, if disclosed ahead of the planned time, would cause significant damage to the brand and potentially also to projected revenues. The actors who attend the red carpet premiere have no idea what they’re going to see on screen. The scripts they were given had false scenes in them as a means of forensic watermarking that helps identify leaks. When you’re protecting 10-year story arcs and plans for what comes after phase 6 of the Multiverse Saga, you develop an appreciation for what needs long-term protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="this-is-a-developer-problem-not-a-ciso-shopping-problem"&gt;This is a developer problem, not a CISO shopping problem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs are directing attention to have quantum security risks added to the corporate risk register. It belongs there. But the problem to be solved is not a quick fix, despite what some snake oil salesmen might be pushing. There is no simple configuration checkbox on AWS or Azure or GCP where you “turn on” post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and then you’re good to go. This is a shared responsibility problem. Just as migrating to the cloud doesn’t magically make your infrastructure more secure, quantum vendors cannot solve this without significant developer engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why this lands on developers: The majority of all internet traffic is not human-generated traffic from laptops to servers and back. It’s API traffic. Your company most likely delivers services using a host of third-party solutions, all accessed via APIs. So your API client needs to learn how to speak PQC algorithms just as much as that remote API endpoint needs to learn how to speak PQC algorithms. Otherwise, the connection will negotiate down to a common protocol that both can speak and it won’t be TLSv1.3 with PQC algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without significant engagement from developers, QA teams and product owners, the quantum decryption risk will remain in play. You cannot transfer this risk by adding more cyber insurance policy coverage. The entire cyber insurance industry itself is in a bit of an existential doubt situation regarding whether cybersecurity can reasonably be insured against, given the systemic impacts of supply chain attacks that cascade across entire industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What can developers actually do? Three concrete steps this quarter:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step one&lt;/strong&gt;: Inventory your algorithms and data with a view towards which sensitive data ought to be protected with PQC. This is a data classification exercise where you need to add a column to track whether the datastore or application qualifies for PQC.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step two&lt;/strong&gt;: Check your internet-facing assets to see which, if any, are already capable of supporting TLSv1.3 with PQC algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step three&lt;/strong&gt;: Create internal capability to test new ciphers so that once NIST is able to “bless” another set of candidates (two of the first set of four algorithms have already been broken), you’ll be positioned to implement them without a five- to 10-year lag time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-fearmongering-critics-are-missing-the-point"&gt;The fearmongering critics are missing the point&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Critics say this is fearmongering and that we’ll have warning signs before quantum becomes a real threat. They’re wrong on the timeline. In my discussions with colleagues on the quantum security working group for the World Economic Forum, we see that financial services, healthcare and manufacturing are making plans now because they understand something crucial: It took us at least 10 years to get financial services to move to SHA-256 for encryption and for PCI compliance requirements to deprecate SSLv3 after TLS came into play in 1999. The insecure protocols weren’t formally deprecated until PCI DSS version 3.1 in 2015. That’s the current speed of “crypto agility” in financial services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cryptographically relevant quantum computer risk, being about five to 10 years away, is essentially a now risk, given the rate of adoption of new cryptography standards. The most dangerous myth seems to be that it can be put off to tomorrow and that nothing needs to be done today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen recent kerfuffles over &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chinese-did-crack-rsa-quantum-yet-marin-ivezic-kew0c/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;factoring 22-bit RSA keys in research papers published in China&lt;/a&gt;, which is just a trivial academic milestone that doesn’t purport the demise of RSA-2048 encryption. But we will continue to see advancements in hybrid classical-quantum approaches to factoring integers. The writing is on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I’ve seen some pretty insane LinkedIn assertions from organizations making statements about computers with 4,000 qubits. For RSA-2048 to be broken, according to Shor’s algorithm, we would need around 20 million qubit quantum computers. So we are still orders of magnitude away. (The marketing teams will make sweeping generalizations about achievements and write them off as “good enough,” often comparing physical qubits and logical qubits as if they’re the same thing, but that is a classic apples-and-oranges fallacy.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="monday-morning-action-items"&gt;Monday morning action items&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The moment when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer comes into existence won’t arrive with fanfare or bombast. Hence, the idea of the silent boom. But by then, it will be too late for incident response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What you should do Monday morning: Start that data classification exercise. Figure out what needs protecting for the long term versus what has a shorter shelf life. In the world of DNS, we have Time To Live (TTL) that declares how long a resolver can cache a response. Think of a “PQC TTL” for your sensitive data, because not everything needs 30-year protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as the HTTPS-everywhere movement took time to gain traction, so too will the PQC-everywhere efforts. The difference is we can’t wait for the attack to happen before we start preparing. There’s no such thing as quantum incident response — only quantum readiness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cybercrime-as-a-service takedown: 7 arrested</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>The expanding CISO role: From security operator to enterprise risk strategist</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4073996/the-expanding-ciso-role-from-security-operator-to-enterprise-risk-strategist.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO job has outgrown its old definition. What started as a technical role has become a test of strategy, stamina, and leadership — and the scope keeps widening. According to Foundry’s 2025 Security Priorities Study, a majority of security leaders say their roles have expanded in the past year, and more than half now brief their boards multiple times a month. The CISO’s reach has extended well beyond cybersecurity operations to encompass enterprise risk, compliance, privacy, and AI oversight — a shift that’s redefining what leadership looks like at the top of the security organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The expanding scope reflects how integral security has become to every aspect of business. Today’s CISOs are taking on ever more responsibilities and functional roles, with many overseeing not just cybersecurity but also risk management, compliance, and even operational domains such as business continuity, data governance, and AI oversight. Some security leaders have added ESG or physical security to their remit — an acknowledgment that cyber risk is inseparable from business resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That expansion has elevated the CISO’s standing. In many enterprises, security leaders are now core members of executive decision-making teams, often helping to shape M&amp;amp;A strategy, product direction, and corporate governance. “CISOs of the present and the future need to get out of being just technologists and build their influence and communication muscle,” said Bread Financial’s Gaurav Kapil in a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4002753/cisos-reposition-their-roles-for-business-leadership.html"&gt;recent CSOonline article&lt;/a&gt; on CISO leadership. “It’s not transactional but more of a value-based conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="CSO 95 percent board engagement" class="wp-image-4073993" height="271" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cso-board-engagement-stat.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But greater influence comes with greater strain. Nearly one in four CISOs say they’re considering leaving the profession due to stress. Role creep has become a real issue, as some organizations consolidate additional duties — from physical security to sustainability — under the same leader. The expectation to oversee everything from ransomware readiness to ESG metrics has created &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3851735/cisos-are-taking-on-ever-more-responsibilities-and-functional-roles-has-it-gone-too-far.html"&gt;what some describe&lt;/a&gt; as a “hodgepodge” of responsibilities that can be unsustainable without the right support structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those tensions — between rising expectations and personal bandwidth — are front and center at this year’s &lt;a href="https://event.foundryco.com/cso-conference-awards/"&gt;CSO Conference&lt;/a&gt; panel, “Navigating Through Uncertainty: Staying Alert and Staying Sane.” Moderated by Bob Bragdon, the discussion brings together Jonathan Chow (Genesys), Frank DePaola (Enpro), and Marcus Johnston (Precisely) to explore how top security executives are balancing expanded mandates with mental resilience and sustainable leadership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The takeaway: The CISO role has evolved from technologist to strategist, from security operator to business risk steward. The influence is real — so is the pressure. As boards turn to security leaders for guidance on everything from AI policy to operational resilience, CISOs are proving indispensable to the enterprise. The challenge now is making the job sustainable for those tasked with defending not just networks, but the business itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CSO Security Priorities study for 2025 will be presented during a discussion at the annual CSO Conference &amp;amp; Awards, October 20–22 at the Grand Hyatt Indian Wells. Join leading CISOs as they share strategies for managing growing responsibilities, sustaining resilience, and leading effectively amid constant uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CISOs face quantum leap in prioritizing quantum resilience</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074154/cisos-face-quantum-leap-in-prioritizing-quantum-resilience.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite recognizing the severity of the threat, enterprises continue to respond slowly to warnings that existing systems must be updated to address the risks of the approaching advent of quantum computers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quantum computers threaten the security of existing public-key cryptography systems. Government agencies such as the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) are advising to adopt &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/654887/11-notable-post-quantum-cryptography-initiatives-launched-in-2023.html"&gt;post-quantum cryptography (PQC)&lt;/a&gt; before a 2030 deadline, in time for the expected depreciation of vulnerable cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, five years from this deadline, &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-risk-regulatory/library/global-digital-trust-insights.html"&gt;PwC’s Global Digital Trust Insights report&lt;/a&gt; paints a picture of a general lack of preparedness for rolling out quantum resistant cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although quantum computing ranks among the top five threats organisations are least prepared to address, fewer than 10% prioritise it in budgets and only 3% have implemented all [the] leading quantum resistant measures surveyed,” the report states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some organisations are making initial progress, with 29% in piloting and testing stages. However, only 22% have moved beyond piloting, and almost half (49%) haven’t considered or started implementing any quantum-resistant security measures,” it adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry readiness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The majority of independent experts quizzed by CSO say the PwC report’s findings reflect a real gap between industry awareness and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4002749/cisos-urged-to-push-vendors-for-roadmaps-on-post-quantum-cryptography-readiness.html"&gt;operational readiness for PQC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sectigo.com/about/leadership/jason-soroko"&gt;Jason Soroko&lt;/a&gt;, senior fellow at automated certificate lifecycle management firm Sectigo, tells CSO that sectors of the economy that are already cryptographically mature are pushing ahead with PQC projects, leaving other sectors even further behind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Uptake is not confined to banking, yet financial services tend to lead because they are highly regulated, risk averse, and exposed to long-lived data risks,” Soroko explains. “Many banks and payment networks have larger cryptographic inventories, established key management and compliance drivers, which push them to move earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Other sectors with long data lifetimes and wide device estates such as government, telecom, cloud, and critical infrastructure are also active,” Soroko adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financial services and professional services are furthest ahead, but manufacturing, oil and gas, mining, and healthcare remain significantly behind, in some cases with PQC adoption as low as 2%, according to cybersecurity vendor Forescout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrishickman613/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Chris Hickman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; CSO at digital identity management firm Keyfactor, says that most organizations are waiting “either for the risk to feel more immediate or for others to make the first move.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That delay will be costly,” Hickman predicts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obstacles to widespread adoption range from a lack of skilled personnel, limited time and competing priorities, and the slow adoption of existing standards, Hickman says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="state-of-migration"&gt;State of migration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Encryption underpins the security of everything from healthcare records to government data and e-commerce transactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But just 8.5% of SSH servers currently support quantum-safe encryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TLS 1.3 adoption — currently at 19% — also trails older, quantum-vulnerable versions, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.forescout.com/blog/q-day-countdown-new-data-on-post-quantum-cryptography-adoption-across-devices-and-industries/"&gt;recent study by Forescout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts paint a more optimistic picture of PQC deployment since &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3486075/nist-finally-settles-on-quantum-safe-crypto-standards.html"&gt;NIST finalized the first post-quantum cryptographic standards&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Google, Apple, Signal, and Zoom have implemented PQC,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncanjones/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Duncan Jones&lt;/a&gt;, head of cybersecurity at integrated quantum computing firm Quantinuum. “Government mandates like &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/30/2003728741/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS.PDF"&gt;CNSA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; set hard deadlines. Financial services are moving — &lt;a href="https://x9.org/"&gt;ASC X9&lt;/a&gt;’s 2025 readiness assessment outlines concrete steps from cryptographic inventory through migration planning.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstacles to adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main obstacles to widespread PQC adoption including cost, standards uncertainty, and organizational inertia. This last issue is significant given that preparing for the quantum threat requires a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030898/prepping-for-the-quantum-threat-requires-a-phased-approach-to-crypto-agility.html"&gt;phased approach to crypto agility&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The obstacles to widespread adoption are very real,” Keyfactor’s Hickman says. “A lack of skilled personnel, limited time and competing priorities, and the slow adoption of the existing standards are the top challenges slowing progress.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hickman continues: “Additionally, risk perception varies, especially between security teams and executive leadership, making it harder to align strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kevin Hilscher, senior director of product management at DigiCert, says the time horizon is playing a significant role in the PQC preparation gap. “Companies are prioritizing other projects because, let’s face it, 2030 is still more than four years away and other projects take precedence,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, security teams find themselves &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4032035/ransomware-up-179-credential-theft-up-800-2025s-cyber-onslaught-intensifies.html"&gt;increasingly under fire from escalating threats&lt;/a&gt; in the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Organizations often lack the expertise or resources to prioritize PQC while dealing with day-to-day threats,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinarosseini/"&gt;Dr. Katrina Rosseini&lt;/a&gt;, a cybersecurity expert at Ascendant Group. “Standards are still evolving, and deploying quantum-resistant algorithms requires careful testing to avoid breaking critical systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, delays in PQC adoption not only leave organizations vulnerable to future quantum threats but also amplify the vulnerabilities already being targeted by attackers, Dr. Rosseini warns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty, complexity, and the difficulties in mapping cryptographic assets are also putting a brake on PQC rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Budgets compete with nearer-term threats and not all people are yet aware of the 2030 deprecation of RSA/ECC by NIST, so planning and investment are delayed,” says Sectigo’s Soroko. “Standards and vendor support are still being operationalized, and some algorithms introduce performance overhead or compatibility issues for legacy systems and constrained devices.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soroko adds: “Skills are scarce and dependencies run through supply chains and cloud services, so end-to-end migration planning and governance slow adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosseini also notes that legacy systems and infrastructure can make rolling out new algorithms difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-mourad-1678a5/"&gt;Benjamin Mourad&lt;/a&gt;, senior director and solution architect at DMI, sees the main obstacles to widespread adoption being education about quantum computing risks — such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030898/prepping-for-the-quantum-threat-requires-a-phased-approach-to-crypto-agility.html"&gt;the threat from “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks&lt;/a&gt; — and funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, improvements in technology over the past year have made implementing and scaling up cryptographic systems more straightforward, Mourad contends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Technological improvements over the past 12 months have improved capabilities and lowered the costs to migrate to PQC at scale with containerized, lightweight applications that did not exist over a year ago,” Mourad explains. “The decreasing need for significant investments in hardware and software will make PQC more scalable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="navigating-quantum-uncertainty"&gt;Navigating quantum uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysts predict quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption anywhere from five to 20 years away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This uncertainty can be distracting, Dr. Rosseini says. “The focus has to be on &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3552701/the-cisos-guide-to-establishing-quantum-resilience.html"&gt;preparedness and resilience&lt;/a&gt;,” she advises. “Organizations need to inventory sensitive assets, assess system readiness, run pilot programs, and secure key management.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PwC report should act as a wake-up call, Dr Rosseini adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Organizations that treat PQC as a strategic security initiative now will be positioned to reduce risk and strengthen resilience,” she says. “Those who wait risk leaving themselves exposed to both present and future threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
