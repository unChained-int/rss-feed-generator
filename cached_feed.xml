      <title>CrashFix attack hijacks browser failures to deliver ModelRAT malware via fake Chrome extension</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4119047/crashfix-attack-hijacks-browser-failures-to-deliver-modelrat-malware-via-fake-chrome-extension.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have uncovered a malicious browser extension campaign, dubbed CrashFix, that deliberately crashes victims’ browsers and then uses the resulting confusion to trick users into running attacker-supplied commands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The activity, attributed to a threat cluster Huntress calls KongTuke, involves a fake Chrome &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4118607/five-chrome-extensions-caught-hijacking-enterprise-sessions.html" target="_blank"&gt;extension&lt;/a&gt; posing as an ad-blocking tool but ultimately delivering a novel malware payload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The extension, which Huntress identified as NexShield-Advanced Web Protection, was distributed through look-alike branding and deceptive metadata designed to resemble a legitimate browser security tool, uBlock Origin Lite ad blocker. After installation, it remains inactive for a period of time, likely to evade immediate suspicion, before intentionally destabilizing the browser by exhausting system resources and triggering repeated crashes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the browser becomes unusable, victims are presented with a fake “repair” prompt instructing them to paste and execute a command to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From fake protection to forced failure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Huntress’ analysis, the malicious extension does not immediately perform malicious actions. Instead, it waits approximately an hour after installation before initiating the crash routine. The extension repeatedly opens connections and consumes memory until the browser becomes unresponsive, forcing users to restart or troubleshoot what appears to be a legitimate failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The extension sets up to two timers: the first triggers once after a 60-minute delay, and the second fires every 10 minutes after the initial trigger,” Huntress researchers said in a blog &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/malicious-browser-extention-crashfix-kongtuke" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. “This timing strategy is in place so that when a user installs the extension, nothing malicious happens immediately. Sixty minutes later, the malicious payload activates, and every 10 minutes thereafter, the payload continues to execute.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On relaunch, the victim receives an alert claiming the browser encountered a critical error and requires manual remediation. Victims are instructed to open the Windows Run dialog and paste a command already copied to the clipboard. This command launches the next stage of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huntress emphasized that this technique mirrors a growing trend in “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3610611/rising-clickfix-malware-distribution-trick-puts-powershell-it-policies-on-notice.html"&gt;ClickFix&lt;/a&gt;”-style attacks, where users are socially engineered into executing malicious code themselves under the guise of system recovery or security remediation. ClickFix techniques have been observed across multiple DPRK-linked campaigns, including variants associated with the long-running&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4098699/contagious-interview-attackers-go-full-stack-to-fool-developers.html"&gt; Contagious Interview&lt;/a&gt; operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Payload delivery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the user executes the supplied commands, a multistage infection process begins that ultimately deploys a previously undocumented Python-based remote access trojan, which the researchers dubbed ModelRAT. The malware establishes persistence and enables remote control of the infected system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huntress’ telemetry suggested differing behavior based on the environment. Systems joined to a domain were more likely to receive the full payload chain, while non-domain systems sometimes received lighter or incomplete stages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also drew parallels between the CrashFix execution flow and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574617/5-top-threats-from-2022-most-likely-to-strike-in-2023.html#:~:text=Drive%2Dby%20downloads%20alive%20and%20well%20with%20SocGholish"&gt;SocGholish&lt;/a&gt; (FakeUpdates) campaigns, noting the shared reliance on user-driven execution rather than technical exploitation. As with SocGholish activity, the attacker’s success depends on convincing the victim to manually run a command under the guise of remediation or system recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recommendations included removing untrusted or look-alike browser extensions and reinforcing guidance against manually executing “fix” commands prompted by browser errors. The researchers also shared indicators of compromise (IOCs) tied to the malicious extension, command execution, and follow-on activity to aid detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The study demonstrates a significant &lt;strong&gt;224% return on investment (ROI)&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;$3.8 million net present value (NPV)&lt;/strong&gt; over three years for organizations adopting Airlock Digital’s allowlisting approach. These findings underline both the financial and security value of Airlock Digital’s solution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt; srcset="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airlock-Digital-Bann-Cr.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all 499w, https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airlock-Digital-Bann-Cr.jpg?resize=300%2C108&amp;amp;quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airlock-Digital-Bann-Cr.jpg?resize=150%2C54&amp;amp;quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all 150w, https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airlock-Digital-Bann-Cr.jpg?resize=444%2C159&amp;amp;quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all 444w" width="499" height="179" sizes="auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Cyber NewsWire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forrester’s TEI methodology evaluates the potential financial impact of technology investments by aggregating insights from customer interviews and modeling a composite organization representative of global organizations. According to the study, Airlock Digital enabled:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;224% ROI&lt;/strong&gt; over three years&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$3.8M net present value&lt;/strong&gt; based on quantified benefits versus costs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;25% reduction in overall risk of security breaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero breaches reported&lt;/strong&gt; by interviewed organizations after deploying Airlock Digital&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant operational efficiencies&lt;/strong&gt; with reduced administrative overhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Cottingham, Co-founder and CEO at Airlock Digital, said: &lt;/strong&gt;“For modern enterprises, trust cannot be assumed… it must be enforced. Allowlisting and application control give organizations the power to run only what they trust, blocking all malware and ransomware before they can execute. For us, the Forrester Consulting TEI study reinforces the importance of our mission at Airlock Digital, which is to deliver proactive endpoint security that makes application control not just possible, but effortless. It’s why we have become synonymous with this critical layer of cyber defense—and why every organization needs it at the core of their security strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As cyberattacks continue to grow in scale and sophistication, more organizations are turning to application control and allowlisting as foundational components of a proactive security strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional reactive security tools attempt to detect and block threats after execution attempts are made—often too late to prevent compromise. Allowlisting reverses this paradigm, enforcing a Deny by Default posture that ensures only trusted and approved software is permitted to run. This approach dramatically reduces the attack surface, curbs the spread of malware and ransomware, and helps organizations meet increasingly stringent regulatory and compliance requirements. Airlock Digital’s modern, operationally friendly implementation of allowlisting enables security teams to adopt this strategy without the administrative complexity historically associated with legacy tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study highlights that Airlock Digital helps organizations strengthen their security posture, lower ongoing maintenance costs, and improve software inventory management while keeping operational and administrative burden low. The study noted that a single security analyst can effectively manage Airlock Digital policies in much less time than traditional solutions require, contributing to cost savings and improved productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick Dillon, CRO at Airlock Digital said: &lt;/strong&gt;“The Forrester Consulting TEI study gives security leaders, in our opinion, clear, independent validation of the impact delivered by Airlock Digital. Forrester Consulting calculated the benefits to include a 224% ROI and fast payback — and most importantly — participating organizations reported zero breaches after implementation. Airlock Digital combines simplicity with enterprise-grade scale, enforcing a Deny by Default posture that blocks untrusted code, including malware and ransomware. For organizations ready to move from reactive defenses to proactive prevention, Airlock Digital provides a quantified and operationally efficient path forward — requiring, according to the Forrester Consulting study, only 2.5 hours per week to manage. We’d be glad to walk you through the findings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Third Party Risk Management hilft Unternehmen, das Risiko von Compliance-Verstößen zu vermeiden." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3386821/1200x.jpg" title="Third Party Risk Management hilft Unternehmen, das Risiko von Compliance-Verstößen zu vermeiden." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Third Party Risk Management hilft Unternehmen, das Risiko von Compliance-Verstößen zu vermeiden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: Diyajyoti – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zeiten der Digitalisierung ist es für Unternehmen unerlässlich, auf die Unterstützung von Drittanbietern zurückzugreifen. Sei es im Bereich der IT-Infrastruktur oder bei der Datenverarbeitung – externe Dienstleister helfen dabei, Geschäftsprozesse effektiver und effizienter zu gestalten. Doch mit der Zusammenarbeit mit Dritten geht auch ein Risiko einher. Unternehmen sollten deshalb ein Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) etablieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-ist-third-party-risk-management"&gt;Was ist Third Party Risk Management?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TPRM ist ein strategischer Ansatz, der darauf abzielt, das Risiko der Zusammenarbeit mit Drittanbietern zu identifizieren, zu bewerten und zu steuern. Er hilft Unternehmen, die Risiken im Zusammenhang mit ihren Drittanbietern besser zu verstehen und zu managen, um Compliance-Verstöße zu vermeiden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warum ist TPRM wichtig? “Unternehmen müssen beispielsweise überprüfen, ob ihre Drittanbieter den SOC2-Prüfungsstandard einhalten. Dieser soll sicherstellen, dass Drittanbieter sensible Kundendaten vor unbefugtem Zugriff schützen”, erklärt GreenPages-Manager Pasteris und ergänzt: “Auch Datenschutzgesetze wie die DSGVO sind in dieser Hinsicht relevant. Wenn Sie selbst compliant sind, nutzt Ihnen das überhaupt nichts, wenn Ihr Drittanbieter sich an nichts hält.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesetipp:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492170/third-party-risk-management-5-wege-mit-drittanbietern-unterzugehen.html" target="_blank" title="5 Wege, mit Drittanbietern unterzugehen"&gt;5 Wege, mit Drittanbietern unterzugehen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kernkomponenten-einer-effektiven-tprm-strategie"&gt;Kernkomponenten einer effektiven TPRM-Strategie&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Thrid Party Risk Managment sollte Folgendes enthalten:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risikoidentifikation und -bewertung: &lt;/strong&gt;Der erste Schritt im TPRM-Prozess ist die Identifikation und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492180/cyber-risk-assessments-risikobewertung-hilft-cisos.html" target="_blank" title="Bewertung der Risiken"&gt;Bewertung der Risiken&lt;/a&gt;, die mit der Zusammenarbeit mit Drittanbietern verbunden sind. Dies umfasst die Analyse der Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, Datenschutzpraktiken und Compliance-Standards der Drittanbieter. Unternehmen sollten eine detaillierte Due Diligence durchführen, um potenzielle Schwachstellen und Risiken zu identifizieren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertragsmanagement: &lt;/strong&gt;Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt des TPRM ist die Implementierung von Vertragsklauseln, die die Verantwortlichkeiten der Drittanbieter hinsichtlich Compliance-Verstößen definieren. Es ist wichtig, dass Unternehmen klare Erwartungen an ihre Drittanbieter haben und dass diese Erwartungen in schriftlicher Form niedergelegt werden. Dies hilft Unternehmen, sich vor rechtlichen Konsequenzen im Falle von Compliance-Verstößen durch Drittanbieter zu schützen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Überwachung und Audits: &lt;/strong&gt;Eine effektive TPRM-Strategie umfasst auch die kontinuierliche Überwachung von Drittanbietern, um sicherzustellen, dass sie weiterhin den Anforderungen entsprechen. Diese kann durch regelmäßige Audits und Prüfungen erfolgen. Unternehmen sollten sicherstellen, dass sie über die notwendigen Ressourcen und Tools verfügen, um die Einhaltung der Compliance-Standards durch ihre Drittanbieter zu überprüfen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schulung und Sensibilisierung: &lt;/strong&gt;Die Schulung und Sensibilisierung der Mitarbeiter über die Risiken und Anforderungen des TPRM ist ebenfalls entscheidend. Mitarbeiter sollten verstehen, warum TPRM wichtig ist und wie sie dazu beitragen können, die Risiken zu minimieren. Regelmäßige Schulungen und Workshops können dazu beitragen, das Bewusstsein für TPRM zu stärken und sicherzustellen, dass alle Mitarbeiter die Compliance-Standards einhalten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-practices-fr-ein-erfolgreiches-tprm"&gt;Best Practices für ein erfolgreiches TPRM&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese vier Tipps helfen bei der TPRM-Umsetzung: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etablierung klarer Richtlinien und Verfahren: &lt;/strong&gt;Unternehmen sollten klare Richtlinien und Verfahren für das TPRM entwickeln und implementieren. Diese sollten alle Aspekte des TPRM abdecken, einschließlich der Auswahl von Drittanbietern, der Vertragsgestaltung, der Überwachung und der Berichterstattung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutzung von Technologie:&lt;/strong&gt; Der Einsatz von Technologie kann das TPRM erheblich erleichtern. Es gibt zahlreiche Tools und Plattformen, die Unternehmen dabei unterstützen, die Risiken zu identifizieren, zu bewerten und zu überwachen. Diese Tools können auch bei der Automatisierung von Audits und Berichterstattungen helfen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration des TPRM in das Enterprise Risk Management (ERM): &lt;/strong&gt;Das TPRM sollte nicht isoliert betrachtet werden, sondern in das umfassende Risikomanagement des Unternehmens integriert werden. Dies stellt sicher, dass alle Risiken, einschließlich derjenigen, die von Drittanbietern ausgehen, ganzheitlich betrachtet und gemanagt werden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regelmäßige Überprüfung und Aktualisierung:&lt;/strong&gt; Die TPRM-Strategie sollte regelmäßig überprüft und bei Bedarf aktualisiert werden, um sicherzustellen, dass sie den aktuellen Bedrohungen und Compliance-Anforderungen entspricht. Unternehmen sollten proaktive Maßnahmen ergreifen, um ihre TPRM-Strategie kontinuierlich zu verbessern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sichere-geschftsprozesse-mit-tprm"&gt;Sichere Geschäftsprozesse mit TPRM &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third Party Risk Management ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Compliance-Strategie jedes Unternehmens, das mit Drittanbietern zusammenarbeitet. Durch die Implementierung einer effektiven TPRM-Strategie können Unternehmen das Risiko von Compliance-Verstößen durch Drittanbieter minimieren und sich vor rechtlichen Konsequenzen schützen. Die Identifikation und Bewertung von Risiken, das Vertragsmanagement, die kontinuierliche Überwachung und die Schulung der Mitarbeiter sind entscheidende Komponenten eines erfolgreichen TPRM.

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>For cyber risk assessments, frequency is essential</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4117003/cyber-risk-assessments-risk-assessment-helps-cisos.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a certain age, many people regularly visit their doctor for check-ups. In this way, risks and dangers can be identified early and appropriate measures taken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same applies to cybersecurity: Regular risk assessments help security teams identify vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Unfortunately, such assessments are not carried out universally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advantages-of-a-cyber-risk-assessment"&gt;Advantages of a cyber risk assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs benefit from the following advantages when they integrate cybersecurity risk assessments into their work:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying vulnerabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; A cyber risk assessment helps to identify security gaps in a company’s IT infrastructure, networks, and systems. This provides the opportunity to eliminate these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by cybercriminals.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize risk management measures:&lt;/strong&gt; Not every system is critical, and not all of a company’s data is equally important. The results of the risk assessment clarify which assets and systems are most critical and at the highest risk of attack. Based on this, security managers can prioritize their measures and thus allocate their resources more effectively to address the most critical risks first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting compliance requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Almost every company must comply with various data protection and data security regulations, such as the GDPR or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Many of these legal requirements explicitly demand specific risk assessments, such as a data protection impact assessment under the GDPR. Risk assessments help to meet the compliance requirements of various regulations. This ensures that the necessary security standards are met and that potential fines or legal consequences for violations are avoided.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make smart decisions and reduce costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber ​​risk assessments give companies a comprehensive understanding of their cyber risks. This allows them to make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies, thereby reducing the likelihood of a successful and costly cyberattack. Furthermore, it enables them to make targeted and therefore more effective investments in their cybersecurity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-look-at-data-risk"&gt;A look at data risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The target of most cyberattacks is a company’s data — with enormously costly consequences: According to IBM’s &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/de-de/reports/data-breach"&gt;Cost of a Data Breach Report 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a data breach caused an average of $4.44 million in damages. Therefore, it is crucial to take a close look at data and the risks it faces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is all the more important because, unlike infrastructure and other systems, data is not “uncompromising.” Servers can be reconfigured, cloud instances rebuilt. But once stolen, data remains in the hands of cybercriminals. Backups offer no protection against this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An analysis of nearly 10 billion cloud objects, conducted as part of data risk assessments at more than 700 companies across various industries worldwide, reveals the risks that data is generally exposed to. According to the analysis, one in 10 data sets in the cloud is accessible to all employees. This creates an internal radius that significantly increases the potential damage from a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, a lack of multifactor authentication (MFA) also makes it easier for attackers to compromise internally exposed data: &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/partner-center/security/security-at-your-organization"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; has found that more than 99% of compromised accounts do not have MFA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These general findings already highlight the biggest problem areas. Nevertheless, it is important to determine the individual data risk and identify weaknesses within the framework of a data risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies typically don’t know what data they possess, where it’s stored, or who has access to it. Only with this fundamental information can they identify their risks and take targeted measures. The time investment is manageable, at around two to four hours, and a comprehensive report provides immediately actionable recommendations. Furthermore, the assessment process often uncovers additional security issues, ranging from ongoing cyberattacks to Kerberos passwords that are up to 15 years old.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regularly conducted cyber risk assessments allow for clear and verifiable documentation of progress in data security — also for management. CISOs finally have a tool at their disposal that makes their cybersecurity successes visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>13 cyber questions to better vet IT vendors and reduce third-party risk</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4119475/13-cyber-questions-to-better-vet-it-vendors-and-reduce-third-party-risk.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increased reliance on IT service providers, digital tools, and third-party software is greatly expanding the enterprise attack surface, with noteworthy cyberattacks over the past year underscoring this fact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2025, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer terminated its longtime helpdesk deal with outsourcing giant Tata Consultancy Services following a cyberattack that cost the British retailer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3986579/aggressive-creative-hackers-behind-uk-breaches-now-eyeing-us-retailers.html"&gt;£300 million and temporarily shut down its online business.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August, a Chinese threat group leveraged &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053891/what-the-salesloft-drift-breaches-reveal-about-4th-party-risk.html"&gt;compromised OAuth tokens&lt;/a&gt; from third-party platform Salesloft Drift to exfiltrate sensitive business data — AWS keys, Snowflake tokens, passwords — from as many as 700 organizations. This came on the heels of a wave of attacks in which cybercriminal gang ShinyHunters &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4035701/we-too-were-breached-says-google-months-after-revealing-salesforce-attacks.html"&gt;pretended to be IT support personnel&lt;/a&gt; to trick users into connecting to malicious versions of Salesforce’s Data Loader, which was then used to exfiltrate data from Salesforce environments. All told, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067846/extortion-gang-opens-data-leak-site-to-squeeze-victims-of-its-salesforce-attacks.html"&gt;1.5 billion Salesforce records&lt;/a&gt; were claimed to have been stolen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, back in April, a critical &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3971211/sap-netweaver-customers-urged-to-deploy-patch-for-critical-zero-day-vulnerability.html"&gt;zero-day vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in SAP NetWeaver, one of the most widespread incidents involving an ERP platform, illustrated that enterprise software has become a prime target for attackers because their compromise directly impacts the revenue, operations, and reputation of an organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Adversaries continue to exploit the path of least resistance, increasingly targeting third-party providers and human vulnerabilities to bypass technical controls,” says Casey Corcoran, field CISO at Stratascale, the cybersecurity division of SHI International. “By compromising trusted vendors, attackers can move undetected for longer periods, exploiting established access points across multiple organizations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because these are newer avenues for attack, companies have been caught on their heels. “We don’t have enough preparation or defensive tools to rapidly detect and defend against these attacks, leading to a significant level of risk for lots of companies,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joswr1ght/"&gt;Joshua Wright&lt;/a&gt;, faculty fellow of the SANS Institute and technical director at Cyber Hack Challenges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnealfordii/"&gt;John Alford&lt;/a&gt;, CSO at TeraType, an adviser to pharmaceutical, financial, and SaaS firms on cybersecurity, compliance, audit and AI governance, says legacy mindsets are also to blame.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations still defend their environments as if threats march up to the front gate when in reality the most effective attackers slip in through the service corridors that nobody monitors,” Alford says. “The Marks &amp;amp; Spencer situation proved this: A help desk workflow became a quiet passage into production because it relied on trust by default.” There appeared to be no strong caller verification processes, no step-up checks, and no guardrails on what support staff could change, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Salesforce ecosystem breaches demonstrate another common blind spot: Once attackers capture a token or exploit a permissive integration, they gain the full authority of a trusted insider. “Companies that rely on perimeter controls and MFA alone never see this risk because they are not watching the right places,” Alford says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-csos-role-in-vetting-it-vendors"&gt;The CSO’s role in vetting IT vendors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber obligations are already written into IT services and SaaS contracts, but “there are limits to what companies can do,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/people/l/lilley-stephen"&gt;Stephen Lilley&lt;/a&gt;, partner at law firm Mayer Brown. “Companies are unlikely to be able to impose cyber requirements that go beyond what is commonly seen in the relevant market. And even sophisticated companies still experience cyber incidents — meaning that IT providers, like their customers, are unable to entirely eliminate the risk from these attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although risk eradication is not possible, better mitigation is. Here, CSOs can play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CSOs are uniquely able to see across the full business process — data flows, dependencies, and downstream impact — but many organizations still don’t use that perspective to reassess third-party risk as reliance grows,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cisorandygross/"&gt;Randy Gross&lt;/a&gt;, CISO for CompTIA. “Cross-functional collaboration is a core CSO imperative: partnering early with procurement, legal, IT, and business leaders so security, resilience, and exit risk are designed in, not bolted on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When engagements are initiated at the business-unit level or come in below financial approval thresholds, CSOs may not even be aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In many organizations, security leaders are brought in only after a contract is executed or — worse — after a security issue arises,” says &lt;a href="https://www.clarkhill.com/people/melissa-k-ventrone/"&gt;Melissa Ventrone&lt;/a&gt;, leader of law firm Clark Hill’s cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy practice. “They should be involved … [and] their involvement does not need to slow the contracting process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, CSOs can act as a “pragmatic technology advisor” says CompTIA’s Gross, seeking critical information they are uniquely qualified to assess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vital-vendor-questions-cisos-should-ask"&gt;Vital vendor questions CISOs should ask&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To gain that critical information, security leaders and experts recommend CSOs ask IT partners the following cyber-specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-what-attestation-will-you-provide-to-prove-proper-security-controls-are-in-place"&gt;1. What attestation will you provide to prove proper security controls are in place?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are essential, says &lt;a href="https://onapsis.com/leadership/juan-pablo-perez-etchegoyen/"&gt;Juan Pablo Perez-Etchegoyen&lt;/a&gt;, CTO for cybersecurity and compliance platform Onapsis. Some of the most commonly used include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOC 2 Type II Report:&lt;/strong&gt; considered the gold standard audit for IT and cloud service providers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ISO/IEC 27001 certification:&lt;/strong&gt; an international standard for information security&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Security Alliance STAR:&lt;/strong&gt; a registry specific to cloud providers that combines ISO 27001 with a controls matrix for cloud-related risks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry-specific attestations:&lt;/strong&gt; for example, HIPAA/HITRUST for handling healthcare data, or PCI DSS for storing or processing credit card data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-how-do-you-maintain-and-update-cybersecurity-controls-over-time-and-how-will-we-be-notified-of-material-changes"&gt;2. How do you maintain and update cybersecurity controls over time, and how will we be notified of material changes?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Would-be clients should have IT partners complete a detailed due diligence questionnaire and contractually obligate them to notify the company of any material changes that would require updates to their responses, advises Clark Hill’s Ventrone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At a minimum, IT vendors should be prohibited from changing security controls that would decrease the security, protection, or resiliency of its systems and company data,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-who-on-your-team-is-capable-of-altering-our-identity-posture-and-what-prevents-a-social-engineered-request-from-triggering-that-action"&gt;3. Who on your team is capable of altering our identity posture, and what prevents a social engineered request from triggering that action?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs can begin with general access inquiries: what access the provider’s team has to customer systems and data, and how that access is segmented and secured, Stratascale’s Corcoran says. Access should be limited by role, with least privilege enforced and multifactor authentication, single sign-on, and network segmentation in place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Look for “logged, monitored, and immediately revocable access — ideally aligned with access control best practices from the NIST RMF function, which emphasizes least privilege and separation of duties,” Corcoran says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then CSOs can get specific. “Many clients focus on firewalls, endpoint agents, and MFA while overlooking the trust pathways that attackers prefer to use,” Alford says. Help desk workflows, OAuth integrations, supplier support portals, and automation connectors typically get less scrutiny even though they can alter identity states or extract large volumes of data with a single action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs should look for strictly defined role scopes, multi-step verification, step-up authentication, and approval chains for credential resets. “Anything short of that signals a blind spot that no amount of technical hardening will cover,” says Alford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-how-can-we-verify-the-workflows-you-use-when-onboarding-offboarding-or-resetting-access-and-can-you-show-evidence-of-how-these-workflows-performed-last-quarter"&gt;4. How can we verify the workflows you use when onboarding, offboarding, or resetting access, and can you show evidence of how these workflows performed last quarter?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many companies underestimate how much operational trust they blindly hand over to providers. IT partners should offer workflow maps, execution logs, and testing records, not just policy documents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most significant gaps appear in the places people assume are safe. I have seen mature organizations with strong 27001 programs, disciplined PCI controls, and well-run internal security teams fall to issues that lived entirely inside vendor workflows,” Alford notes. “Help desk resets, poorly scoped automation tokens, and inherited admin rights all surfaced in post-incident reviews as quiet pathways that no one had modeled.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Risk assessments should focus not just on servers and networks but identity workflows and human-operated processes as well. “When you widen the lens, you often discover controls that look strong on paper but behave differently in practice,” Alford says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-what-independent-testing-do-you-conduct-and-how-often-is-it-performed"&gt;5. What independent testing do you conduct, and how often is it performed?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT partners should have a third party run security tests and assessments, and provide copies or executive summaries of these vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and other audits at least annually and whenever there are material changes to their network, infrastructure, or security controls, Clark Hill’s Ventrone says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ThreatLocker CEO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyjenkinscyber/"&gt;Danny Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; stresses frequency: “Threats are always evolving, so a once-a-year audit is not sufficient. All systems should be undergoing regular penetration testing and improvement.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-can-you-list-every-oauth-integration-and-privileged-api-relationship-in-your-service-and-explain-how-each-is-scoped-rotated-monitored-and-revoked"&gt;6. Can you list every OAuth integration and privileged API relationship in your service and explain how each is scoped, rotated, monitored, and revoked?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“OAuth integrations are often treated as harmless conveniences rather than high-privilege conduits,” Alford explains. “In reality, they function like a network of forgotten tunnels. They bypass the front gate entirely and connect systems deep inside the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies should ask service partners to provide a token inventory, minimal scopes, finite lifetimes, and behavioral monitoring. Broad or permanent tokens are red flags, signaling elevated risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. If an attacker abused one of your processes &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; breaching your systems, what are your contractual and operational commitments?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These agreements often hand providers the practical ability to alter identity states, access sensitive data, or operate parts of the production environment. That level of delegated trust deserves the same scrutiny as hiring a senior operations leader,” says Alford. “When providers can reset passwords or manage OAuth integrations, the contract becomes a control document. It defines how risk will be shared and what evidence the client can demand.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without CSO involvement, contractual clauses are usually weak. “They focus on uptime rather than security, and they rarely require the provider to support strong authentication, tamper-evident logging, or event-level transparency,” Alford adds. Clients should insist on obligations tied to process compromise, not just system compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-what-controls-govern-your-staffs-activity-in-our-environment-and-how-would-we-detect-if-a-privileged-session-deviated-from-expected-behavior"&gt;8. What controls govern your staff’s activity in our environment, and how would we detect if a privileged session deviated from expected behavior?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Modern attacks flow through trust relationships and soft operational processes,” Alford points out. “They exploit the places where no one expects danger — like help desks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, controls on vendor staff behavior and detection of deviations are critical. Companies should insist on session recording, real-time alerts, and segregation of duties, Alford advises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rapid detection and revoking access can make all the difference in an incident,” Onapsis’ Perez-Etchegoyen adds. Continuous application-level monitoring, clear incident response procedures, and the ability to immediately disable users or integrations are key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-how-will-you-isolate-our-assets-and-data-from-other-customers-including-identity-separation-automation-boundaries-and-admin-segregation"&gt;9. How will you isolate our assets and data from other customers — including identity separation, automation boundaries, and admin segregation?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs should seek architectural clarity and concrete mechanisms that limit blast radius, says Alford. They should also ask how the IT partner manages the cybersecurity risks posed by their value chains of vendors and subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“IT partners should have a robust vendor management program and conduct appropriate due diligence on their own service providers,” advises Ventrone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-how-quickly-will-you-notify-us-of-a-security-incident-that-impacts-our-data-or-systems"&gt;10. How quickly will you notify us of a security incident that impacts our data or systems?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The biggest gains come from simple steps,” says CompTIA’s Gross, including gaining clarity on how incidents are disclosed and outages are handled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs should look for guaranteed notification within 24 to 72 hours, a tested incident response plan, and clearly defined breach reporting timelines and responsibilities written into the contract, says Stratascale’s Corcoran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When an incident occurs, “IT partners should provide customers with sufficient information to perform their own threat analysis,” Alford says. “If an IT partner doesn’t provide the insight needed to identify attacks against their customers, then customer organizations can only rely on the detection and reporting capabilities of the hosting provider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-how-do-you-identify-prioritize-and-remediate-vulnerabilities"&gt;11. How do you identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Review of IT partner’s patching policies and remediation timelines should never be overlooked, as many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities. “Slow patch cycles lead to supply chain disruptions, business operational issues, and even bankruptcy in some cases,” says Perez-Etchegoyen, who emphasizes SLAs related to critical patches and proof that fixes are validated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ventrone gives the example of a company that outsourced firewall management to a vendor. After a vulnerability in the firewall was exploited, the vendor ended up restoring the vulnerable version, resulting in a second compromise. In another example, a client found out that its IT partner, which had experienced a ransomware attack through its VPN, patched just once a month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I literally could not believe this was considered sufficient,” Ventrone says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-do-you-carry-enough-cyber-insurance-to-cover-the-impact-to-all-your-customers"&gt;12. Do you carry enough cyber insurance to cover the impact to all your customers?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to see a lot more attacks against SaaS providers,” says SANS Institute’s Wright. “Attackers have lots of motive here since the access obtained when a SaaS provider is compromised is significant, with lots of subsequent opportunity for ransomware, extortion, and direct harassment attacks against customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ventrone says clients should confirm their provider’s policy covers not only themselves but the full impact of a multi-customer incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="13-can-we-test-your-processes"&gt;13. Can we test your processes?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attestations regarding cybersecurity testing and monitoring — such as regular penetration testing, 24/7/365 security monitoring, threat hunting — are essential, Wright says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Alford recommends going a step further. “Lots of firms do questionnaire-based reviews that confirm policies exist but rarely test how provider processes work in practice. They assume a support vendor has strong verification steps. They assume an integration partner follows least privilege. They assume a SaaS platform has adequate logging for delegated access,” says Alford, warning against presumptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Verification through evidence, realistic scenarios, and process testing changes everything,” he says. “It exposes where risk actually lives and gives you the ability to design controls that match how attackers think rather than how documentation reads.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ongoing-diligence-necessary"&gt;Ongoing diligence necessary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Recent incidents underscore that many organizations are not adequately managing third-party risk over the full lifecycle of their IT provider relationships,” notes Clark Hill’s Ventrone, adding that too often due diligence is treated as a one-time exercise, with insufficient ongoing oversight to ensure that security controls and procedures remain appropriate as systems evolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stratascale’s Corcoran also notes that cyber due diligence often falls through the cracks. “Many client organizations still fall short in managing third-party risk because it’s often treated as a collateral duty, split between procurement and general risk functions rather than a dedicated, optimized process,” he says. “As a result, business stakeholders remain unsatisfied and critical risks go unmitigated, even as attackers increasingly exploit weaker links in the supply chain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, partners in the IT ecosystem are being seen by cybercriminals to be those weaker links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>EU reviews cybersecurity to limit danger from high-risk suppliers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4120006/eu-reviews-cybersecurity-wants-to-reduce-risks-from-high-risk-suppliers.html</link>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has presented a new &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_105" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cybersecurity package&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen the European Union’s resilience to increasing cyber and hybrid attacks from state and criminal actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key is to reduce risks from high-risk suppliers outside the EU, especially in critical infrastructure such as mobile networks, through a common and risk-based framework. The Commission’s news release did not mention any specific suppliers targeted by the measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The move should make it possible to reduce the risk to sensitive parts of the EU’s IT ecosystem based on previous work on 5G security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An updated European Cybersecurity Certification Framework (ECCF) will also make it faster and easier to security test products and services. The package also simplifies compliance with existing cybersecurity rules to reduce the administrative burden, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the EU’s cybersecurity agency, ENISA, will be strengthened, among other things by giving it a more central role in threat analysis, incident response, vulnerability management, and coordination within the EU.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The package of measures needs to be approved by the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers. Member states will then have one year to implement the changes in their national legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Misconfigured demo environments are turning into cloud backdoors to the enterprise</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4120258/misconfigured-demo-environments-are-turning-into-cloud-backdoors-to-the-enterprise.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internal testing, product demonstrations, and security training are critical practices in cybersecurity, giving defenders and everyday users the tools and wherewithal to prevent and respond to enterprise threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, according to new research from Pentera Labs, when left in default or misconfigured states, these “test” and “demo” environments are yet another entry point for attackers — and the issue even affects leading security companies and Fortune 500 companies that should know better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that popular public training apps like Hackazon, Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), and OWASP Juice Shop have been frequently left accessible to the public internet, inadvertently exposing top vendors including Palo Alto Networks, Cloudflare, and F5.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not theoretical research,” &lt;a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/noamyaffe" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Noam Yaffe&lt;/a&gt;, Pentera’s senior researcher and offensive security team lead, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://pentera.io/blog/exposed-cloud-training-apps-pentera-labs/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technical blog post&lt;/a&gt;. His team discovered “clear evidence” that these attack vectors are being exploited in the wild to enable crypto miners, webshells, and persistence mechanisms. The attackers are believed to be of Eastern European origin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This research proves that labeling something as ‘training’ or ‘dev’ doesn’t make it invisible to attackers,” Yaffe noted. “If it’s on the internet and it has cloud credentials, it’s a target.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="exposing-crown-jewels-through-seemingly-harmless-labs"&gt;Exposing crown jewels through seemingly harmless labs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After identifying an exposed instance of Hackazon, a free, intentionally vulnerable test site developed by Deloitte, during a routine &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4117003/cyber-risk-assessments-risk-assessment-helps-cisos.html" target="_blank"&gt;cloud security assessment&lt;/a&gt; for a client, Yaffe performed a five-step hunt for exposed apps. His team uncovered 1,926 “verified, live, and vulnerable applications,” more than half of which were running on enterprise-owned infrastructure on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They then discovered 109 exposed credential sets, many accessible via a low-priority lab environment, tied to overly-privileged &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/518296/what-is-iam-identity-and-access-management-explained.html" target="_blank"&gt;identity access management (IAM)&lt;/a&gt; roles. These often granted “far more access” than a ‘training’ app should, Yaffe explained, and provided attackers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrator-level access to cloud accounts, as well as full access to S3 buckets, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The ability to launch and destruct compute resources and read and write to secrets managers;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Permissions to interact with container registries where images are stored, shared, and deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers maintained persistent access, moved laterally across networks, exploited cloud credentials and other sensitive information, and crypto-mined victim infrastructure. Further, Pentera’s researchers easily discovered active secrets such as Slack keys, GitHub tokens, and Docker Hub credentials, as well as real user data and proprietary source code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alarmingly, in DVWA, 54% of instances discovered still used the default credentials ‘admin:password,’ and attackers could downgrade security settings in a single click (from “impossible” to “low”), making every built-in vulnerability “trivially exploitable,” Yaffe noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What began as a harmless lab could lead directly to an organization’s crown jewels,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="real-world-exploitations"&gt;Real-world exploitations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one real-world instance, Pentera’s team discovered a misconfigured buggy web application (bWAPP) linked to Cloudflare cloud accounts running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). bWAPP is a free, open source, deliberately insecure web app used for &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4119475/13-cyber-questions-to-better-vet-it-vendors-and-reduce-third-party-risk.html" target="_blank"&gt;training purposes&lt;/a&gt;. Querying GCP’s metadata services, the researchers were able to impersonate default service accounts and gain read access to “hundreds” of storage buckets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a DVWA linked to F5’s cloud accounts was found running on a GCP instance, again allowing the researchers to access numerous storage buckets containing logs and metric data. In addition, a misconfigured Palo Alto-linked DVWA app was identified running on AWS; Yaffe and his team used the attached IAM role and temporary credentials to gain full administrative access to the AWS account.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also exfiltrated OAuth tokens for a GCP service account to assume its identity, and list and access specific bucket content. For instance, one “cloud_build” bucket stored .tgz files that attackers could easily download. The account was managed by an admin email and violated least privilege because it contained policy permission, Yaffe explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even though this was a ‘dev’/ ‘training’ account, it contained highly sensitive secrets, credentials, and API tokens,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In assessing these misconfigured, vulnerable applications, his team found “clear evidence” that they were already being fully exploited in the wild. Roughly 20% of the DVWA instances they discovered contained artifacts deployed by malicious actors, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XMRig Crypto Miner actively running, sending proceeds to attacker-controlled wallets, and configured to run silently without user knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A “sophisticated” watchdog script that maintained persistence even after a compromise had been discovered. This featured self-recovery, automated downloads, encrypted payload delivery, evidence deletion, and kill switches that threat actors could use to easily shut down operations;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A PHP webshell that granted attackers the ability to read, write, delete, upload and download files; run operating system (OS) commands and scripts on remote machines; and access credentials, API keys, and other secrets embedded in source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All discoveries were responsibly disclosed to the impacted organizations and were subsequently mitigated prior to publication, Yaffe emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These weren’t isolated incidents; they represented an organized, ongoing exploitation campaign,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-enterprises-can-do-now"&gt;What enterprises can do now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To defend against this widespread threat, Yaffe and his team developed SigInt, a Python-based, large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous reconnaissance framework. &lt;a href="https://github.com/noamYaffe1/SigInt" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The tool&lt;/a&gt;, which is available on GitHub, generates fingerprint signatures directly from a live target or GitHub repository, searches for matches, and applies confidence scoring. It also incorporates IP intelligence, cloud provider detection, attribution data, and provides analysis to support further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, Yaffe advised enterprises to “inventory everything” to establish a complete, up-to-date picture of all cloud resources, including ‘temporary’ and ‘test deployments,’ perform regular audits to scan for exposed services, and apply least privilege.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Never attach broad IAM roles to training or demo environments,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, defenders should isolate training environments from production networks and apply the same monitoring and alerting to them as production environments, restrict their outbound internet access, document and enforce changes to default credentials pre-deployment, and set controls that expire temporary testing environments after a specified timeframe. “If it doesn’t have an end date, it will run forever,” Yaffe noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he emphasized: “These are fixable problems. Basic hygiene … would have prevented every case we found.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>GitLab 2FA login protection bypass lets attackers take over accounts</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4120316/gitlab-2fa-login-protection-bypass-lets-attackers-take-over-accounts.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A critical two-factor authentication bypass vulnerability in the Community and Enterprise editions of the GitLab application development platform has to be patched immediately, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hole is one of five vulnerabilities patched Wednesday as part of new versions of GitLab. Three are ranked High in severity, including the 2FA bypass issue, while the other two are ranked Medium in severity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GitLab says the 2FA hole, &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-0723" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-0723&lt;/a&gt;, if exploited on an unpatched system, could allow an individual with knowledge of a victim’s ID credentials to bypass two-factor authentication by submitting forged device responses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s this hole that has drawn the attention of experts, because of the implications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal of multifactor authentication is to protect login accounts with an extra verification step in case usernames and passwords are stolen. If a threat actor can access an account, they can do almost unlimited damage to IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of GitLab, if critical code is sitting in a developer’s account, a threat actor could compromise it, notes &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, head of Canadian-based security awareness training firm Beauceron Security. If that code is to be used in software that can be downloaded or sold to other organizations, then inserted malware could be spread in a supply chain attack. The latest example, Shipley said, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095578/new-shai-hulud-worm-spreading-through-npm-github.html" target="_blank"&gt;is the Shai-Hulud worm&lt;/a&gt;, which is spreading because a developer’s account in the npm registry was hacked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the code contains cloud secrets, he added, the threat actor could gain access to cloud platforms like Azure, Amazon Web Service, or Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discovery of the 2FA bypass hole “is a reminder that these [security] controls are important,” Shipley said in an interview. “They absolutely help reduce a number of risks: Brute force attacks, password spraying, and so forth. But they will never be infallible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is not the first time someone has found a clever way to get around 2FA challenges. We have a whole series of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4118607/five-chrome-extensions-caught-hijacking-enterprise-sessions.html" target="_blank"&gt;attacks around session cookie capture&lt;/a&gt; which are also designed to defeat 2FA. So it’s important to remember this when someone drops some Silver Bullet thinking that ‘This magic solution solves it [authentication]’ or ‘That’s the bad MFA. Here’s the new MFA.’ And I include [trusting only] Yubikeys,” he said. “Yubikeys are amazing. They’re the next generation of 2FA. But because they are made for humans, eventually they will have some flaws.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if there weren’t flaws in these controls, employees might be tricked into giving up credentials through social engineering, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would be easier for an attacker to use techniques like phishing to collect user credentials rather than forge a device credential to exploit this particular 2FA bypass, said &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute. But, he added, once the attacker has access to valid passwords, they can log in to the GitLab server and perform actions on the source code — download it, alter it or delete it — just as a legitimate user would.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-infosec-leaders-need-to-do"&gt;What infosec leaders need to do&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why Cybersecurity 101 — layered defense — is vital for identity and access management, Shipley said. That includes forcing employees to have long, unique login passwords, monitoring the network for unusual activity (for example, if someone gets in without an MFA challenge recorded) and, in case all fails, an incident response plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MFA bypass vulnerabilities are very common, noted Ullrich. “The core problem is usually that MFA was added later to an existing product,” he said, “and some features may not properly check if MFA was successfully completed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When testing a multifactor authentication solution, infosec leaders should always verify that an application has not marked authentication as completed after the username and password were verified. Enabling MFA should not relax password requirements, he asserted. Users must still pick unique, secure passwords and use password managers to manage them. Secure passwords will mostly mitigate any MFA failures, Ullrich said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any vulnerability found in GitLab is significant, he added. GitLab is typically used by organizations concerned enough about the confidentiality of their code that they want to run the platform on premises. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gitlab-strongly-recommends-upgrades"&gt;GitLab ‘strongly’ recommends upgrades&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In describing the patches released Wednesday, GitLab said it “strongly” recommends all self managed GitLab installations be upgraded to one of the three new versions (18.8.2, 18.7.2, 18.6.4) for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE). Those using GitLab.com or GitLab Dedicated –  a single tenant software-as-a-service version –  don’t have to take any action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other vulnerabilities fixed in Wednesday’s updates are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13927" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-13927&lt;/a&gt;, a denial of service issue in Jira Connect integration. If exploited on an unpatched system, it could allow an unauthenticated user to create a denial of service condition by sending crafted requests with malformed authentication data. It carries a CVSS severity score of 7.5;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13928" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-13928&lt;/a&gt;, an incorrect authorization issue. If exploited on an unpatched system, it could allow an unauthenticated user to cause a denial of service condition by exploiting incorrect authorization validation in API endpoints.  It carries a CVSS severity score of 7.5;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13335" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-13335&lt;/a&gt;, an infinite loop issue in Wiki redirects. Under certain circumstances, this hole could allow an authenticated user to create a denial of service condition by configuring malformed Wiki documents that bypass cycle detection. It has a CVSS score of 6.5;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-1102" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-1102&lt;/a&gt; – a denial of service issue in an API endpoint that could allow an unauthenticated user to create a denial of service condition by sending repeated malformed SSH authentication requests. It has a CVSS score of 5.3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In keeping with standard GitLab practice, details of the security vulnerabilities will be made public on an &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/?sort=created_date&amp;amp;state=closed&amp;amp;label_name%5B%5D=bug%3A%3Avulnerability&amp;amp;confidential=no&amp;amp;first_page_size=100" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issue tracker&lt;/a&gt; 30 days after the release in which they were patched. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new versions also include bug fixes, some of which, GitLab said, may include database migrations. In cases of single-node instances, a patch will cause downtime during the upgrade. In the case of multi-node instances, admins who follow proper GitLab zero-downtime upgrade procedures can apply a patch without downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>73% of CISOs more likely to consider AI-enabled security solution</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4120218/73-of-cisos-more-likely-to-consider-ai-enabled-security-solution.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISO’s are increasingly turning to AI-enabled security technologies to augment their organizations’ cyber defense and extend the capabilities of their teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Foundry’s &lt;a href="https://foundryco.com/research/security-priorities/"&gt;latest Security Priorities Study&lt;/a&gt;, 73% of security decision-makers are now more likely to consider a security solution that uses artificial intelligence, up from 59% the year prior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs plan to leverage AI in a range of security functions, including malware detection, threat detection, anomaly detection, real-time risk prediction, and audit and compliance. They are also eyeing AI for automating security responses, performing authentication, ensuring data loss prevention, and improving enterprise system visibility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 24 AI Plans" class="wp-image-4074988" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24-ai-plans-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_ec4a7b.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents cited AI-enabled benefits such as faster detection of unknown threats, accelerating response times, and automating security tasks to reduce employee workload. The findings are in line with an October 2025 study from management consultancy PwC, which found AI ahead of cloud security and data protection as the &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2025/pwc-digital-trust-insights.html"&gt;top cybersecurity investment priority for enterprises over the next 12 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But cutting through the hype to ensure AI investments have optimal impact remains an issue. Experts quizzed by CSO said that security leaders should prioritize AI investment over the next 12 to 18 months to boost anomaly detection, enhance identity and access management, and automate response, but they should also be aware of potential pitfalls such as hallucinations, over-reliance on AI, and governance gaps when implementing AI in their security strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cutting-through-the-noise"&gt;Cutting through the noise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-newbury-086b01aa/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Oliver Newbury&lt;/a&gt;, chief strategy officer at cyber resilience vendor Halcyon and previously CISO at Barclays, tells CSO that the “strongest uses of AI in security are the ones that improve visibility and reduce noise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Teams need clearer signals, earlier warnings, and quicker routes to certainty in the middle of an unfolding incident,” Newbury says. “AI that can sift large volumes of activity, highlight meaningful patterns, and present them in a way that analysts can act on immediately is where organizations see real benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newbury adds: “These capabilities help shorten investigation time and support faster, confident decision-making during high-pressure situations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A human-led approach is no longer sufficient to deal with the increased complexity and volume of threats, many security experts contend. Strategic use of AI technology has the potential to recognize patterns of attack and offer analysts the ability to cut through the noise and make better decisions, freeing up time and resources to deal with higher-value security work and move beyond constant firefighting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most security teams are overloaded, and not because they lack tools, but because they lack time and clear signals,” Newbury says. “AI earns its keep in the areas where speed and pattern recognition genuinely outperform manual effort: behavioral anomaly detection, early-stage threat indicators, and the subtle identity-related activity that often precedes a ransomware event.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="check-against-delivery"&gt;Check against delivery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-tyler-outlier/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;David Tyler&lt;/a&gt;, founder of tech consultancy Outlier Technology, warns that some vendors slap the label ‘AI’ on existing capabilities while adding a higher price tag combined with solid product development and real advances from others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of what’s being sold as breakthrough AI is actually decades-old technology finally being implemented properly; this isn’t necessarily bad, as good product management matters as much as novel algorithms,” Tyler says. “But if a vendor’s ‘AI security solution’ appeared overnight in the last couple of years, you’re probably looking at rebranding rather than genuine capability building.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities AI Benefits Slide 24" class="wp-image-4120224" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25-ai-benefits-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs should be asking how long the vendor has been investing in these capabilities and what their product evolution looks like, according to Tyler.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Companies that have been building graph-based correlation, adaptive baselining, and behavioral analytics for a decade are very different from those who just added an AI chat function to their user interface and called it innovation,” Tyler says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbolster/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Dr. Andrew Bolster&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of R&amp;amp;D at application security vendor Black Duck, also warns CISOs about vendors slapping neural networks onto existing tools without fixing underlying data quality issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your AI-powered authentication system is only as good as your identity data hygiene,” Dr. Bolster says. “Your AI-powered malware detection is only as good as your sample corpus quality and labelling accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr Bolster adds: “Before signing contracts for AI security platforms, audit your data governance maturity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bolster also argues that CISOs themselves should focus more on how to build an AI-ready security data platform rather than which security tools they need to buy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CISOs should invest in data mesh architectures that treat security telemetry as a first-class data product with defined ownership, quality SLAs [service level agreements], and standardized schemes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-an-ai-security-platform"&gt;Building an AI security platform&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/merlingillespie/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Merlin Gillespie&lt;/a&gt;, operations director at managed security services provider Cybanetix, sees the AI security market maturing — and moving away from point solutions that offer reduced operational expenditure toward a more integrated approach. Gillespie warns that this shift creates fresh challenges for security leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These days every security tool has a layer of AI ‘assistance’ but instead of simplifying operations this is creating overlapping tools, inconsistent reporting, and unclear provenance of data,” according to Gillespie. “The learning is that AI-labelled tools are helpful but aren’t a solution in themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exercise most organizations face is classifying which processes are eligible for automation, and which of these are enhanced by the determinism and reasoning of AI, Gillespie advises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security teams should apply the same top-down analysis used across their wider business to support software and personnel efficiency, rather than being led by vendor tooling which can result in further siloing,” Gillespie says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="potential-pitfalls"&gt;Potential pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Halcyon’s Newbury warned that these issues were far from the only potential pitfalls that come from deploying AI systems. For example, over-reliance on AI systems can lead to greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI shouldn’t replace the fundamentals such as asset management, patching, identity governance, proper segmentation, or tested recovery plans,” Newbury says. “Those disciplines matter even more as attackers adopt AI at speed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Issues inherited from the inadequate training of AI systems can also create problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI systems can easily inherit blind spots if they’re trained on narrow or unrealistic datasets,” he says. “CISOs must understand how models are trained and where their assumptions break down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware remains the clearest test of whether AI investment is being prioritized in the right places, Newbury argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most modern [ransomware] incidents are effectively identity-based attacks,” Newbury says. “Attackers are logging in rather than ‘hacking in,’ often armed with credentials harvested at scale by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3951147/infostealer-malware-poses-potent-threat-despite-recent-takedowns.html"&gt;infostealers&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newbury adds: “As adversaries fold AI into their operations, you’ll see more of these attacks landing faster and hitting harder. That makes the resilience question far more urgent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newbury concludes: “AI is worth the investment but only where it sharpens decision-making, reduces noise, and gives teams the time and clarity to act before a problem becomes a crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Warum Microsoft-365-Konfigurationen geschützt werden müssen</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4120020/warum-microsoft-365-konfigurationen-geschutzt-werden-mussen.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Microsoft 365 Outlook" class="wp-image-4097409" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2108335628.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lesen Sie, warum CISOs den M365-Tenant stärker in den Blick nehmen müssen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;IB Photography – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Jahr 2010 war Office 365 eine einfache Suite mit Office-Anwendungen und zusätzlicher E-Mail-Funktion. Das hat sich 15 Jahre später mit Microsoft 365 geändert: Die Suite ist ein wesentliches Element in den Bereichen Kommunikation, Zusammenarbeit und Sicherheit. Dienste wie Entra, Intune, Exchange, Defender, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4077862/microsoft-stoppt-ransomware-angriffe-auf-teams-nutzer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Teams&lt;/a&gt; und SharePoint verfügen über Tausende von Konfigurationsdetails, die dafür sorgen, dass Unternehmen reibungslos und sicher laufen. Wenn diese verloren gehen, versehentlich gelöscht oder absichtlich geändert werden, hat das enorme Auswirkungen auf die Geschäftsabläufe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dabei geht es um weit mehr als nur um Daten. Die Tenant-Konfigurationen sind die Blaupause für den Betrieb der M365-Umgebung. Einfach ausgedrückt: Wenn der Microsoft-365-Tenant ausfällt, fällt auch der Geschäftsbetrieb aus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trotz dieser enormen Bedeutung der Tenant-Konfigurationen ist in der IT-Welt eine Fehlannahme weit verbreitet: Rund die Hälfte aller IT-Verantwortlichen geht fälschlicherweise davon aus, dass die nativen Backup-Lösungen von Microsoft einen umfassenden Schutz für wichtige Tenant-Konfigurationen, -Einstellungen und -Richtlinien bieten. Um es deutlich zu sagen: Microsoft sichert die Konfigurationen nicht und kann sie folglich auch nicht wiederherstellen. Dies liegt gemäß dem Modell der „shared responsibility“ in der Verantwortung der Anwender.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-bedeutung-der-tenant-konfigurationen"&gt;Die Bedeutung der Tenant-Konfigurationen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tenant-Konfigurationen sind die digitale Grundlage für die Sicherheitslage und die betriebliche Integrität eines Unternehmens. Sie umfassen über 10.000 einzigartige Richtlinienelemente für kritische Dienste. Sie regeln den Benutzerzugriff, die Compliance und das Anwendungsverhalten, also alles, was für den reibungslosen Ablauf eines Unternehmens unerlässlich ist:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sicherheitseinstellungen&lt;/strong&gt;: Diese erste Verteidigungslinie umfasst Richtlinien für den bedingten Zugriff, die festlegen, wer von wo aus auf was zugreifen darf, sowie Regeln für die Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495262/multi-faktor-authentifizierung-so-finden-sie-die-passende-mfa-losung.html" target="_blank"&gt;MFA&lt;/a&gt;). Gehen diese Einstellungen verloren oder werden sie manipuliert, haben Angreifer ein leichtes Spiel und können Perimeter-Kontrollen einfach umgehen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identitätsmanagement&lt;/strong&gt;: Nahezu jedes Unternehmen (95 Prozent) war in den vergangenen 18 Monaten von einer Cloud-bezogenen Sicherheitsverletzung betroffen, wobei die meisten davon auf unsichere Identitäten zurückgeführt werden konnten. Benutzer- und Gruppeneinstellungen, Administratorrollen und App-Berechtigungen in Entra ID (ehemals Azure AD) bilden den Kern der Identitätssicherheit. Wenn diese kompromittiert werden, bricht das gesamte Framework zusammen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance-Richtlinien&lt;/strong&gt;: In regulierten Branchen ist der Nachweis der Regeltreue unverzichtbar. Policies zum Schutz vor Datenverlust (Data Loss Prevention, DLP) verhindern, dass sensible Informationen das Unternehmen verlassen, während Aufbewahrungsrichtlinien sicherstellen, dass Daten für rechtliche und Prüfungszwecke aufbewahrt werden. Kann ein Unternehmen die Einhaltung der Vorgaben nicht nachweisen, drohen empfindliche Strafen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Einstellungen für die Zusammenarbeit&lt;/strong&gt;: Richtlinien in Teams, SharePoint und Exchange regeln die externe Freigabe, den Gastzugriff und den Datenfluss. Wenn diese Einstellungen fehlen oder falsch konfiguriert sind, riskieren Unternehmen eine unkontrollierte Offenlegung von Daten. Dadurch vergrößert sich die Angriffsfläche erheblich.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Integrität dieser Einstellungen ist das Rückgrat jeder &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank"&gt;Zero-Trust&lt;/a&gt;-Architektur. Ohne korrekte Konfigurationen lassen sich weder das Least-Privilege-Prinzip durchsetzen noch die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494023/cybersicherheitsvorschriften-so-erfullen-sie-ihre-compliance-anforderungen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Compliance einhalten&lt;/a&gt;. Entsprechend ist der Verlust der Konfigurationen keine bloße Unannehmlichkeit, sondern bedeutet einen erheblichen Kontrollverlust über die gesamte digitale Infrastruktur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="haeufig-uebersehen-aber-essenziell"&gt;Häufig übersehen, aber essenziell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Fehlen von Konfigurations-&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495970/die-besten-cyber-recovery-anbieter.html"&gt;Backups&lt;/a&gt; ist nicht nur eine potenzielle Security-Katastrophe, sondern spiegelt auch ein fundamentales Missverständnis darüber wider, was Microsoft 365 eigentlich ist. Dabei handelt es sich eben nicht um eine einfache Lösung. Vielleicht kann man es sich wie ein Glas Wasser vorstellen: Der Tenant ist das Glas und das Wasser sind die Daten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nicht alle Vorfälle, die Konfigurationen gefährden, sind gleich schwerwiegend. Auf der einen Seite des Spektrums können geringfügige Manipulationen an wichtigen Konfigurationen zwar ärgerlich sein, stellen jedoch keine existenzielle Bedrohung für das Unternehmen dar. Auf der anderen Seite könnten Sicherheitsverantwortliche damit konfrontiert werden, dass die Identitätsinfrastruktur und Sicherheitsvorkehrungen großflächig gelöscht worden, was eine Katastrophe mit potenziell existenzbedrohenden Folgen für das Unternehmen darstellt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treten kleinere Fehlkonfigurationen auf, wie zum Beispiel versehentlich geänderten Berechtigungen eines einzelnen Benutzers, kann die Fehlerbehebung zwar Stunden dauern, stellt aber letztlich keine existenzielle Krise für das Unternehmen dar. Es ist vergleichbar mit einem angestoßenen Glas: Man kann es problemlos und ohne Risiko nutzen, auch wenn es nicht ideal ist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein fehlerhaftes PowerShell-Skript einen bestimmten Dienst für eine begrenzte Anzahl von Benutzern unterbricht, verlangsamt dies die Produktivität und führt zu Störungen des Geschäftsbetriebs. Allerdings kann das Skript wiederhergestellt werden, auch wenn der Ausfall unbequem und zeitaufwändig ist. Dies ist vergleichbar mit einem gesprungenen Glas. Es ist zwar noch verwendbar, aber das Risiko für die Stabilität des Glases steigt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein vollständiger Verlust der Tenant-Konfigurationen führt schließlich zu massiven Ausfallzeiten und bedeutet für Unternehmen ohne Konfigurations-Backups das reine Chaos. Bedeutende Richtlinien wie Authentifizierung, E-Mail-Fluss oder Zugriffskontrolle wurden beschädigt, manipuliert oder versehentlich gelöscht, wodurch der gesamte digitale Arbeitsbereich unbrauchbar ist. Das Glas ist zerschellt. Erst wenn ein neues zur Verfügung steht, also der Tenant auf sichere Weise wiederhergestellt wurde, kann man auch wieder mit den Daten arbeiten (also das Wasser einfüllen, ohne dass es gleich wieder irgendwo ausläuft).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ohne Konfigurations-Backups, einschließlich Richtlinien, Berechtigungseinstellungen und Benutzerrollen, können Unternehmen nur mit enorm hohem Zeit- und Ressourcenaufwand zum sicheren Ausgangszustand zurückkehren. Deshalb führt an einem intelligenten Konfigurations-Backup kein Weg vorbei. Seit Jahren ist die Sicherung kritischer Daten für Unternehmen eine Selbstverständlichkeit. Es ist höchste Zeit, dass auch die Sicherung des Tenants flächendeckend umgesetzt wird. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
