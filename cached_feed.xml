      <title>Top 10 vendors for AI-enabled security — according to CISOs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115785/top-10-vendors-for-ai-enabled-security-according-to-cisos.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Venture capital may be flowing to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080699/10-promising-cybersecurity-startups-cisos-should-know-about.html"&gt;trendy AI security startups&lt;/a&gt;, but battle-tested CISOs seem to be sticking with tried-and-true, name-brand technology partners for their AI-enabled security needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the key takeaway from &lt;a href="https://foundryco.com/research/security-priorities/"&gt;CSO’s 2025 Security Priorities Study&lt;/a&gt;, which collected responses from more than 640 senior security executives from across the globe. When asked to rank leaders in AI-powered security, the largest and most well-known security vendors topped CISOs’ lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The criteria CISOs used to rank industry leaders starts with product innovation. But CISOs also leaned heavily into practical matters, rather than flash and sizzle. The vendor’s reputation and whether they had been victimized by a high-profile breach was the second most important factor. Then came business value of the solution, cost/pricing, name recognition, vendor age, time to integrate the solution, and whether peers also use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-market-report"&gt;Grandview Research points out&lt;/a&gt;, “The AI in cybersecurity industry is expanding due to the seamless integration of AI technologies with existing cybersecurity frameworks. Organizations prefer solutions that complement their current systems, ensuring minimal disruption and maximum efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also making a strong showing on the list were service providers, either full-on managed security service providers (MSSPs), cloud-based proxy services, or content delivery network providers that have expanded into cybersecurity. Clearly, CISOs are looking for ways to lift the burden of incident response off short-staffed and harried security teams.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the top 10 leaders in AI-enabled security in order of their ranking in our survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-cisco"&gt;1. Cisco&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: With its strong roots in networking, Cisco has an established foothold in the enterprise — and a stranglehold on the data that networking gear generates. The acquisitions of Duo Security (multifactor authentication and zero trust), Thousand Eyes (visibility), and Splunk (AI-powered SIEM), have enabled Cisco to integrate networking and security capabilities. Cisco recently launched AI Assistant for Security, an interface trained on massive security datasets to help analysts with event triage, root cause analysis, policy design, and simplifying firewall management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduced “Foundation-sec-8b-reasoning,” an AI foundational model designed to apply AI-powered reasoning to security tasks such as threat modeling, attack vector analysis, risk assessment, and security architecture evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; John Grady, principal analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group, says, “The AI era demands a transformative approach to security. Organizations need distributed, identity-based, zero trust protection for applications, users, AI models, and agents, supported by a unified policy framework. Cisco is in a very unique position to support this with its ability to embed advanced protections directly into the network.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-microsoft"&gt;2. Microsoft&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to Cisco, Microsoft is embedded in virtually every enterprise, and is also a vendor that has marshalled its considerable resources to build an AI-powered security ecosystem. The platform includes Microsoft Defender for securing cloud environments, Microsoft Sentinel for cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Purview for data governance, Microsoft Intune for endpoint management, Microsoft Entra for identity and access management, and Microsoft Defender XDR for threat detection and response. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduced Microsoft Security Copilot, a generative AI-powered security tool that helps increase the efficiency and capabilities of security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft visionary investment in OpenAI has paid off in catapulting Microsoft to a leadership position in the AI era. A new agreement inked in October cements Microsoft’s position as the key beneficiary of OpenAI Foundation’s research. The agreement gives Microsoft a 27% stake in OpenAI (valued at $135B), but more importantly it preserves Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI as its “frontier model partner.” Microsoft said its IP rights for both OpenAI’s models and products have been extended through 2032.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-google"&gt;3. Google&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Google has a well-deserved reputation as an innovator in cloud-based security services. Google is a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for SIEM. Gartner says, “Use of AI is a core competency for Google and its SecOps platform offers strong AI functionality throughout many of the common activities and functions associated with SIEM operations.” &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;IDC names Google a leader in its 2025 MarketScape for Worldwide Incident Response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves:&lt;/strong&gt; Announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3848035/alphabet-agrees-to-buy-israels-wiz-expanding-its-cloud-security-reach.html"&gt;buy cloud security platform vendor Wiz for $32B&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is expected to close in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Google offers a broad range of AI-powered security solutions, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3958409/google-launches-unified-enterprise-security-platform-announces-ai-security-agents.html"&gt;many based on its purchase of Mandiant&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. These include Google Threat Intelligence, Google Security Operations, Google Unified Security, Google AI protection, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4041892/new-security-features-beef-up-google-cloud-platform.html"&gt;Google Agentic SOC&lt;/a&gt;, which combines AI-driven automation with human expertise. Once the Wiz acquisition is finalized, Google will have expanded capabilities across multicloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-akamai-technologies"&gt;4. Akamai Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Akamai has successfully pivoted from being a content delivery network (CDN) provider to offering a platform for developing and running applications in the cloud, as well as providing a broad range of complementary cybersecurity services. These include web application and API protection (WaaP), Akamai firewall for AI, and zero trust security. In a recent evaluation conducted by SecureIQ Lab, Akamai outperformed competing vendors in a test of WaaP capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Akamai continues to aggressively build out its platform; key acquisitions include Linode, Neosec, and Noname Security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; IDC analyst Dave McCarthy says, “By extending compute capabilities to its vast network of over 4,400 locations across 134 countries, Akamai provides a differentiated value proposition in the crowded cloud market. This focus on low-latency, high-performance, and secure edge-native applications enables Akamai to avoid a direct, head-on confrontation with hyperscalers. Instead, it positions Akamai to cater to the growing demand for applications that require processing and data storage closer to the end user, thereby enhancing performance and security for distributed workloads.” The company recently launched Akamai Inference Cloud, a platform for securely distributing AI workloads across cloud and edge environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-ibm"&gt;5. IBM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Another gold standard name in the industry, IBM offers a broad range of managed security services that leverage the power of AI. The IBM portfolio includes IBM Guardium for AI-driven data security; Trusteer, which uses AI and machine learning for digital identity management; MaaS360 for AI-powered device security; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4010085/ibm-combines-governance-and-security-tools-to-solve-the-ai-agent-oversight-crisis.html"&gt;watsonx.governance for AI governance&lt;/a&gt;. IDC places IBM in the leader category of its MarketScape for worldwide managed detection and response (MDR). The crown jewel is IBM’s X-Force team of incident response experts. IDC says that IBM’s MDR leverages the X-Force protection platform, AI, contextual threat intelligence, and a global team operating in over 110 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves: &lt;/strong&gt;IBM inked a complex strategic partnership with Palo Alto Networks designed to enhance AI-powered security offerings for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; The deal with Palo Alto Networks gives IBM the inside track on providing consulting services for Palo Alto customers. According to IDC’s MarketScape, IBM’s consulting services, which include incident readiness planning, risk assessments, security testing, and vulnerability assessments, are a key differentiator for enterprise customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-abnormal-ai"&gt;6. Abnormal AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite all the time, money, and effort poured into security, the one persistent vulnerability that seems most difficult to solve is social engineering attacks targeting email recipients. Enter Abnormal AI, which uses the power of AI, machine learning, and anomaly detection to analyze human behavior and protect end users from phishing and related email-centric attacks. Abnormal is a leader in the latest Forrester Wave for email, messaging, and collaboration security. And it is a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for email security.The company also offers phishing simulation training.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves: &lt;/strong&gt;The company was originally named Abnormal AI when it launched in 2018, but the market wasn’t ready for AI, so the company switched to Abnormal Security. Now, it has rebranded back to its original name, a reflection of market acceptance of AI-powered security solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook: &lt;/strong&gt;Abnormal AI is expanding beyond just email to a broader AI-driven platform. Says CEO Evan Reiser,“We started with email security because it was the biggest problem to solve at the time, and because it provides the richest data set of human behavior. Our goal is to become the most trusted and dependable AI in cybersecurity — one that protects people from the full spectrum of modern threats, utilizing AI to make decisions at superhuman speed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-crowdstrike"&gt;7. CrowdStrike&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: An innovator in cloud-native, AI-driven cybersecurity, CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform encompasses endpoint security, threat intelligence, and incident response, offered as a fully managed service. GigaOm rates CrowdStrike as a leader in its evaluation of autonomous SOC solutions. GigaOm cites CrowdStrike’s strength in AI-powered detection, unified EDR, next-generation SIEM, and SOAR, as well as agentic innovation with Charlotte AI. CrowdStrike is also a leader in Gartner’s analysis of endpoint protection platforms, and a leader in IDC’s MarketScape for cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPP).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Acquired AI security vendor Pangea. The deal will enable CrowdStrike to extend its Falcon platform into AI detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;: IDC points out that there is a push toward platformization in cybersecurity. “This is worthy of mention as CrowdStrike has a wide depth and breadth of capabilities built into its Falcon platform that provides the technology muscle for its MDR offering. The added capabilities, such as its managed cloud workload protection (CWP) for continuous runtime protection across hybrid and multicloud environments, workloads, and containers, and its fully managed identity threat protection service called Falcon Complete Identity Threat Protection provide expert management, monitoring, protection, and optimization of identities and identity stores.” IDC adds, “Organizations that are looking to consolidate their disparate technology point products into a unified managed platform should consider CrowdStrike.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-arctic-wolf"&gt;8. Arctic Wolf&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Arctic Wolf provides cloud-based MDR services with an open, flexible, vendor-neutral approach. The Arctic Wolf Platform ingests telemetry from the customer’s existing stack of security tools across endpoint, network, cloud, and identity. There’s no vendor lock-in when it comes to the organization’s choice of security tools. Arctic Wolf is a leader in the IDC MarketScape for MDR. IDC points out that Arctic Wolf addresses the problem of SOC analysts being overwhelmed by too many alerts with its ability to distill telemetry to a manageable number of tickets per day through the use of AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves:&lt;/strong&gt; Bought UpSight Security to accelerate the development of AI-powered ransomware protection and rollback capabilities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Arctic Wolf continues to evolve its platform to incorporate use of AI. Arctic Wolf recently introduced its AI Security Assistant, which allows for natural language interaction, enabling customers to ask questions and gain more context about their security environment. At the same time, the human element remains a key part of the Arctic Wolf service: The Arctic Wolf Concierge Security Team consists of security experts who analyze each customer’s security environment and business context and then provide advice on how to shore up security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-cloudflare"&gt;9. Cloudflare&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloudflare started out as a reverse-proxy CDN with a clear mission: securing the Internet. Over time, Cloudflare has leveraged its global footprint to deliver a broad range of cybersecurity services. The Cloudflare AI Security Suite offers a unified platform to secure workforce AI tools and public-facing applications, discover shadow AI, protect models from abuse, secure agent access, and prevent data exposure in prompts. Cloudflare is a leader in the 2025 Forrester Wave for Web application firewall services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloudflare has acquired Replicate, a startup with software that makes it easier to deploy AI models in production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; The company’s lineup of AI-enhanced cybersecurity services includes AI-powered threat detection, bot management, encryption, email security, firewall, data loss protection, AI security posture management, and secure AI application development. In its latest quarter, revenue climbed 31% year over year, and analysts are predicting that Cloudflare will reach a $3B annual revenue run rate in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-broadcom"&gt;10. Broadcom&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Known primarily as a chipmaker that shook up the industry with &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/1248933/china-clears-broadcoms-69b-vmware-acquisition-allowing-deal-to-close.html"&gt;its purchase of VMware&lt;/a&gt;, Broadcom is also a vendor with deep connections to the enterprise through its acquisitions of management software leader CA Technologies and security vendor Symantec. Broadcom has combined the Carbon Black EDR technology that was part of the VMware deal with Symantec to create a new division — Enterprise Security Group. Broadcom also offers capabilities that cloud-based security vendors don’t, such as mainframe security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Announced Symantec AI, a fully agentic assistant that leverages Symantec and Carbon Black capabilities to automatically respond to threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook: &lt;/strong&gt;Broadcom does a good job leveraging its alliances, particularly with Google Cloud. Broadcom supplies data center chips to Google, moves enterprise VMware workloads to Google cloud, incorporated Google’s Vertex AI development platform with Symantec AI, and uses Google Gemini models as the basis for its AI agents. Broadcom has also beefed up VMware security with AI enhancements to VMware vDefend lateral security and VMware AVI load balancer. Broadcom’s approach is to provide integrated security from silicon to software, using AI-driven analytics and automation to reduce the burden on security teams and stay ahead of evolving threats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-security-vendors-leadership-vs-current-use"&gt;AI security vendors: Leadership vs. current use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One key point to note: This list represents the vendors that CISOs perceive as leaders, not necessarily the ones that they currently use for AI-enabled security. That top 10 list consists of Cisco and Microsoft in the top two spots, cited by 27% and 24% of respondents respectively. The next batch of vendors came in between 19% and 15%, so not necessarily a statistically significant difference. That group included Akamai, Abnormal, Broadcom, Google, Carbon Black, and Cloudflare. CrowdStrike (12%) and Check Point (11%) rounded out the top 10. So, basically the order is shaken up a bit, but the core list of vendors remains pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Firm stand against migrant smuggling: global alliance convened in Brussels</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/firm-stand-against-migrant-smuggling-global-alliance-convened-in-brussels</link>
      <description>On 10 December 2025, Europol participated in the second International Conference of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, hosted by the European Commission. Over 80 delegations, including EU Member States, EU agencies, third party countries, international organisations, and private parties attended the event. During this high-level conference, over 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen cooperation along migrant smuggling routes and tackle the growing digital dimension of these criminal activities. The declaration underscores new preventive measures, including a crackdown on online advertisements promoting migrant smuggling and the disruption of underground banking systems fuelling the criminal business.</description>

      <title>For application security: SCA, SAST, DAST and MAST. What next?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115679/for-application-security-sca-sast-dast-and-mast-what-next.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have stared at enough scanner dashboards to recognize the pattern. SAST flags theoretical flaws that never execute. DAST shrugs because the route to the vulnerable function is blocked. SCA floods the zone with CVEs that never touch a hot path. MAST scolds my mobile app for secrets I retired last quarter. These tools are still essential, yet they now form a baseline rather than a destination. The next chapter is not another “silver bullet” product; it is a shift toward posture, provenance and proof.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chart: Posture, provenance and proof." class="wp-image-4115680" height="575" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/posture-provenance-proof.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Sunil Gentyala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year the community has admitted the obvious: the battleground is the software supply chain and the running system, not only pre‑release scans. OWASP’s 2025 update elevated &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/A03_2025-Software_Supply_Chain_Failures/"&gt;software supply chain failures&lt;/a&gt; to A03, reframing vulnerable and outdated components as a systemic ecosystem risk that spans dependencies, build systems and distribution infrastructure (Endor Labs &lt;a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/owasp-top-10-adds-a03-2025-software-supply-chain-failures"&gt;overview here&lt;/a&gt;). In parallel, CISA pushed SBOM guidance forward with a 2025 draft that demands richer, machine‑readable metadata and emphasizes automation for scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="posture-provenance-and-proof-the-new-trinity"&gt;Posture, provenance and proof: The new trinity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Application security posture management (ASPM) is the control plane that makes the old quartet useful again. Gartner’s 2025 Innovation Insight described how ASPM connects scattered signals across the SDLC, enforces policy and prioritizes based on context, such as reachability and exposure in practice, which means pulling SAST, DAST, SCA, IaC and runtime findings into a single view, then filtering for the small subset that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I prefer framing ASPM through a code to cloud lens because it mirrors how our systems actually work. The Wiz Academy guide lays out ASPM’s core capabilities, unified visibility, risk prioritization, policy enforcement and stresses continuous discovery across development, build and deployment. The goal is to cut alert fatigue while connecting code issues to runtime impact &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/application-security-posture-management-aspm"&gt;ASPM&lt;/a&gt;. This aligns with Gartner’s premise but adds practical detail about correlating repository signals, pipeline policies and cloud reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Posture is the ‘what.’ Provenance is the ‘how’. The &lt;a href="https://slsa.dev/"&gt;SLSA&lt;/a&gt; framework gives us a shared vocabulary and verifiable controls to prove that artifacts were built by hardened, tamper‑resistant pipelines with signed attestations that downstream consumers can trust (OpenSSF &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/projects/slsa/"&gt;overview here&lt;/a&gt;). When I insist on SLSA Level 2 for most services and Level 3 for critical paths, I am not chasing compliance theater; I am buying integrity that survives audit and incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proof is where SBOMs finally grow up. Binding SBOM generation to the build that emits the deployable bits, signing them and validating at deploy time moves SBOMs from “ingredient lists” to enforceable controls. The CNCF TAG‑Security best &lt;a href="https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/Software_Supply_Chain_Practices_whitepaper_v2.pdf"&gt;practices v2 paper&lt;/a&gt; is my practical map, personas, VEX for exploitability, cryptographic verification to ensure tests actually ran, and prescriptive guidance for cloud‑native factories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: if your SBOM describes developer intent rather than what executes, you will miss the next recall. Generate SBOMs from the build that produced the binary, sign them, ingest VEX and gate deployments on verification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-dashboards-to-decisions-aspm-in-practice"&gt;From dashboards to decisions: ASPM in practice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A posture program is a set of habits, not just a platform. I start by unifying scanner outputs into a single risk register, but I refuse to triage in a vacuum. Findings must carry reachability evidence, data sensitivity tags and exposure context. That is where ASPM earns its keep. The Wiz Academy material underscores this code to cloud connection and shows how to reduce noise so developers see the few issues that block business rather than a wall of theoretical risk. Gartner’s framing makes the case for adoption in regulated environments where fragmented signals undermine remediation velocity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two implementation notes from my own programs. First, wire ASPM to owners. Every finding needs a resolver and an SLA, or it is just a report. Second, gate risky builds. Policy enforcement is not a dashboard; it is a decision. If an artifact lacks provenance or a VEX shows exploitability in a reachable path, it does not ship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: Keep one policy source of truth. If security policy lives in three tools, developers will ignore all three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chain-rigor-without-theater"&gt;Supply chain rigor without theater&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supply chain work can degrade into paperwork if we forget what matters. Integrity is the point. I keep SLSA simple. Level 2 quickly, Level 3 for critical paths. That means a hardened build service, isolated builds, signed provenance and a verified chain from source to artifact.  SBOMs become operational once they are machine-readable, signed and validated on deploy. &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025_CISA_SBOM_Minimum_Elements.pdf"&gt;CISA’s&lt;/a&gt; 2025 draft tightened expectations for fields, formats and automation, which I welcome because it makes procurement and incident response faster and cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/reports/public-sector-software-supply-chain-whitepaper/"&gt;CNCF paper&lt;/a&gt; fills in the gaps. It explains how to couple SBOMs with VEX, add cryptographic checks for pipeline steps, and treat developer infrastructure as part of the supply chain. That last point matters because attackers increasingly target repositories, CI settings and artifact registries, not just code dependencies. Public sector guidance from CNCF echoes the same priorities for government workloads, with concrete lessons from SolarWinds, Log4Shell and xz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: never accept a vendor SBOM without a signature and a provenance attestation. If they cannot prove how the software was built, your risk calculus is guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="runtime-reality-instruments-not-illusions"&gt;Runtime reality: Instruments, not illusions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prerelease testing is necessary but not sufficient. IAST instrumentation gives me runtime truth during QA, observing actual execution paths to reduce false positives and preserve developer context. In production, the mental model shifts to RASP, which blocks exploitation inside the application at the exact moment risky operations occur: SQL construction, OS exec, serialization, where WAFs cannot see. This is not a knock on WAFs; it is a recognition that network layer inspection and application layer introspection solve different problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think perimeter controls are enough, two weeks in November 2025 should dispel that. CISA issued emergency guidance for Cisco ASA and FTD vulnerabilities (CVE‑2025‑20333, CVE‑2025‑20362) because agencies reported devices as “patched” that were still on vulnerable trains. The directive prescribed minimum versions, forensic checks and timelines, and reminded everyone that all devices must be updated, not only Internet‑facing ones (CISA &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-identifies-ongoing-cyber-threats-cisco-asa-and-firepower-devices"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lesson is portable: treat “patched” as a state with proofs. Validate minimum release trains, verify fleet‑wide and decommission end‑of‑support gear. Pair perimeter controls with application‑layer sensors and container runtime protection because your workloads increasingly live in Kubernetes and managed platforms. &lt;a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/kubernetes-market"&gt;Market analyses&lt;/a&gt; confirm the shift toward orchestrated, cloud‑native estates where consistent runtime policy is possible (CNCF trend post &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/01/22/kubernetes-in-2025-are-you-ready-for-these-top-5-trends-and-predictions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: wire runtime telemetry to your TDIR practice. When RASP blocks an injection in production, that event should spawn code fixes, not just a closed alert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="securing-ai-and-the-supply-chain-ecosystems"&gt;Securing AI and the supply chain ecosystems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the nexts, AI is the most mercurial. NIST’s final 2025 guidance on adversarial ML split threats across PredAI and GenAI and called out prompt injection in direct and indirect form as the dominant exploit in agentic systems where trusted instructions co mingle with untrusted data (&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-prompt-injection-nist-report"&gt;Meritak Overview;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-prompt-injection-nist-report"&gt;IBM explainer&lt;/a&gt;). The U.S. AI Safety Institute published work on agent hijacking evaluations, which I treat as required red‑team reading for anyone delegating actions to tools (&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/01/technical-blog-strengthening-ai-agent-hijacking-evaluations" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST AISI blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For builders, the July 2024 NIST SP 800‑218A community profile extends SSDF into generative AI and dual-use foundation models. It covers threat modeling prompts, securing training data pipelines, isolating model operations and binding model documentation to secure development practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the language layer an unfashionable recommendation turned mainstream. In June 2025 NSA and CISA urged adoption of memory‑safe languages with pragmatic migration guidance for legacy estates—start where it matters most, integrate incrementally and shield old modules behind hardened FFI (&lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/23/2003742198/-1/-1/0/CSI_MEMORY_SAFE_LANGUAGES_REDUCING_VULNERABILITIES_IN_MODERN_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT.PDF" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NSA/CISA CSI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="language-choices-that-erase-entire-bug-classes"&gt;Language choices that erase entire bug classes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to delete vulnerability classes, stop writing them. In June 2025, NSA and CISA published a joint CSI urging adoption of memory-safe languages with pragmatic migration guidance for legacy estates. Start where it matters, integrate incrementally and shield old modules behind hardened FFI. This is not academic posturing. Buffer overflows, use after free and data races erode resilience and cost real money. Memory-safe languages reduce those risks by design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: mandate memory-safe languages for net new development, plan migrations for high-risk modules and publish a runway with dates and metrics. Explain the why using NSA and CISA guidance, then measure the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-sca-sast-dast-and-mast-fit-now"&gt;Where SCA, SAST, DAST and MAST fit now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They remain foundational when docked into a posture‑centric program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAST still catches design and implementation flaws, but I insist on reachability analysis and developer‑first remediation inside the IDE; feed SAST into ASPM for context so theoretical issues do not overwhelm real ones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;DAST is indispensable for pre‑release exposure, yet I pair it with IAST to observe live code paths and reduce false positives.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;SCA moves beyond CVE lists when SBOM generation binds to builds and VEX cuts noise; CNCF best practices and CISA’s 2025 SBOM draft describe how to do this well.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;MAST keeps mobile hardening honest, but I roll secret hygiene and secure storage checks into the same lifecycle controls used for server apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leadership-advisory-what-i-implement-next"&gt;Leadership advisory: what I implement next&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the operating model I have shipped in regulated environments that cannot afford to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASPM as control plane.&lt;/strong&gt; Unify signals, deduplicate and rank by exploitability—reachability, exposure, data sensitivity. Route ownership automatically and use policy gates on risky builds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain rigor.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt SLSA levels, require signed SBOMs and attestations, and validate at deploy. No artifact without provenance, no deploy without verification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime protection.&lt;/strong&gt; Embed RASP in application stacks, enforce container runtime controls and keep WAF at the edge. Wire events to your TDIR pipeline so blocking in production triggers fixes in code.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets lifecycle and machine identities.&lt;/strong&gt; Central vaulting, automated rotation, least privilege everywhere, mutual TLS for service‑to‑service authentication.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI security program.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt NIST SP 800‑218A, red‑team agents for hijacking, enforce privilege separation and monitor outputs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language policy&lt;/strong&gt;. Mandate memory‑safe languages for net‑new development, plan migrations for high‑risk modules and use NSA/CISA’s guidance to educate stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCA, SAST, DAST and MAST remain the bedrock, but they are most effective when orchestrated by ASPM, proven by SLSA and SBOMs, and defended by runtime controls. Add AI-specific safeguards and memory‑safe languages, and you move from chasing findings to making decisions with confidence. That is my “what next.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ransomware-Banden erpressen Opfer mit Compliance-Verstößen</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116135/ransomware-banden-erpressen-opfer-mit-compliance-verstosen.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Compliance. Security" class="wp-image-4116138" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2564305989.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ransomware-Gruppen setzen ihre Opfer vermehrt mit Compliance-Verstößen unter Druck.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Digitala World – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware-Attacken zählen nach wie vor zu den häufigsten Angriffsmethoden. Wie aktuelle Analysen zeigen, drohen Cyberbanden ihren Opfern nun vermehrt damit, Verstöße gegen Vorschriften wie die DSGVO an die Aufsichtsbehörden zu melden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So haben Forscher des Security-Anbieters Akamai bereits in den vergangenen zwei Jahren einen zunehmenden Trend bei dieser Taktik beobachtet. Als Beispiel verweisen die Sicherheitsspezialisten auf die Ransomware-Gruppe Anubis. Die Mitglieder würden sich hauptsächlich auf Branchen mit hohen Compliance-Risiken wie das Gesundheitswesen konzentrieren. Auch die berüchtigte &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495093/ransomware-ransomhub-lost-lockbit-von-der-spitze-ab.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ransomhub&lt;/a&gt;-Bande setzt demnach auf diese Methode. So soll sie ihre Partner ausdrücklich dazu ermutigt haben, gehackten Unternehmen regulatorische Strafen anzudrohen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="folgen-fur-unternehmen"&gt;Folgen für Unternehmen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Das setzt Unternehmen unter einen doppelten Druck, der kaum zu bewältigen ist“, erklärt Klaus Hild, Manager Solution Engineering Enterprise bei SailPoint, gegenüber CSO. Sie müssten zwischen Lösegeldzahlung und potenziell ruinösen Strafen sowie Reputationsverlust abwägen. „Diese ‘&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/de/compliance/" target="_blank"&gt;Compliance&lt;/a&gt;-Erpressung’ ist keine theoretische Bedrohung mehr – sie ist zum Standardverfahren von Ransomware-Kartellen geworden“, so der Experte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tim Berghof, Security Evangelist bei G DATA, bestätigt auf Nachfrage von CSO, dass es sich bei dieser Vorgehensweise technisch gesehen zwar nur um eine Erweiterung der „branchenüblichen” Double Extortion handelt, aber massive Folgen mit sich bringen kann. „Selbst, wenn eine erfolgte Anzeige sich als gegenstandslos erweist. Behördliche Ermittlungsverfahren erzeugen Aufsehen, binden Ressourcen und werden potenziell publik.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-verstarkt-angriffe"&gt;KI verstärkt Angriffe&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hild verweist auf ein weiteres Problem: „KI-gestützte Tools beschleunigen diese Angriffe dramatisch. Kriminelle können heute innerhalb weniger Stunden nach einem Datendiebstahl gestohlene Dokumente auf ‘materielle’ Compliance-Verstöße screenen – schneller und präziser, als viele Unternehmen ihre eigenen Systeme auditieren können.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der SailPoint-Spezialist führt aus: „Sie erstellen detaillierte, rechtlich fundierte Beschwerden für Behörden und setzen enge Fristen. Mit neuen Regulierungen wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3804883/dora-umsetzung-halt-banken-cisos-auf-trab.html" target="_blank"&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt; in der EU und verschärften SEC-Meldepflichten wächst das Arsenal dieser Erpresser stetig.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berghoff fasst zusammen: „Die Frage bleibt, was für Unternehmen die glimpflicheren Folgen hat: Eine Selbstanzeige oder die anonyme Meldung bei der zuständigen Behörde durch eine Gruppe Krimineller. Da es auch in einigen Bereichen noch viel Unsicherheit um das Thema Compliance gibt, fallen Drohungen mit Behörden hier auf potenziell fruchtbaren Boden.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity risk will accelerate this year, fueled in part by AI, says World Economic Forum</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116270/cybersecurity-risk-will-accelerate-this-year-fueled-in-part-by-ai-says-world-economic-forum.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity risk will accelerate this year, fueled by advances in AI, deepening geopolitical fragmentation and the complexity of supply chains, the World Economic Forum (WEF) says in its annual Global Cybersecurity Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way to combat it, however, isn’t new, the report adds. “Ultimately, strengthening collective cyber resilience has become both an economic and a societal imperative. Cybersecurity is a frontier where collaboration remains not only possible, but powerful — a reminder that, even amid fragmentation, economic strain and uncertainty, collective action can drive progress for all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The coming year will test not only global technological preparedness but also the capacity to align policy, ethics, and collaboration in defending an increasingly digital world, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Cybersecurity_Outlook_2026.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Issued Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the 64 page report is based partly on answers to 19 questions from a survey last fall responded to by 804 C-suite executives, academics, civil society and public-sector cybersecurity leaders in 92 countries. That included 316 CISOs. Additional material was gathered from workshops, including a session with 21 executives from the forum’s Centre for Cybersecurity’s CISO community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the fifth annual cybersecurity report from the WEF. Last year’s edition found that a series of compounding factors — geopolitical tension, intricate supply chains, regulatory proliferation and rapid technological adoption — were creating an era of escalating complexity and unpredictability, and this year’s continues the theme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the latest report’s main findings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI is anticipated to be the most significant driver of change in cybersecurity in 2026, according to 94% of survey respondents;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;87% of respondents said AI-related vulnerabilities had increased in the past year. Other cyber risks that had increased were (in order) cyber-enabled fraud and phishing, supply chain disruption, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;confidence in national cyber preparedness continues to erode, with 31% of survey respondents reporting low confidence in their nation’s ability to respond to major cyber incidents, up from 26% last year. Confidence levels vary greatly across regions, with 84% of respondents from the Middle East and North Africa being confident in their country’s ability to protect critical infrastructure, and only 38% of North American respondents confident their countries were prepared;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;asked to rate their own organization’s cyber resilience, 23% of representatives from public sector and international organizations thought their readiness was insufficient. By contrast, only 11% of private sector respondents thought negatively about their firms;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;91% of organizations with more than 100,000 employees have changed their cybersecurity strategies due to geopolitical volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, CEOs and CISOs weren’t always on the same page when it came to rating cyber risks for their organizations. In the 2025 survey, most CEOs said ransomware, cyber-enabled fraud and phishing, and supply chain disruption were their biggest cyber concerns. This year, cyber-enabled fraud and phishing shifted to number one, followed by AI vulnerabilities and exploitation of software vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, while most CISOs also said ransomware was their top concern in the 2025 survey, they reversed the CEO’s order to list supply chain disruption second, then cyber-enabled fraud and phishing. And in the latest survey, ransomware and supply chain disruption were still the top two, but the third worry is now exploitation of software vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This suggests that CEOs tend to be more concerned about the broader business impacts of frauds, the report says, while for CISOs, the concern over ransomware reflects the significant operational disruption a successful ransomware attack can inflict on the availability of critical information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110699/8-things-cisos-cant-afford-to-get-wrong-in-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;Related content: 8 things CISOs can’t afford to get wrong in 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WEF report focuses on AI because leaders believe it will be the most significant driver of change in cybersecurity this year. The widespread integration of AI systems adds an expanded attack surface that creates novel vulnerabilities that traditional security controls were not designed to address, the report says. In addition, threat actors are leveraging AI to enhance the scale, speed, sophistication, and precision of their attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, defenders can also use AI, to strengthen their cyber capabilities. But, the report stresses, “AI’s benefits are contingent on disciplined execution. Poorly implemented solutions can introduce new risks — misconfiguration, biased decision‑making, over‑reliance on automation, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation — unless organizations embed robust guardrails, security‑by‑design practices and continuous monitoring.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The implication is clear,” says the report. “AI can improve cybersecurity, but only when deployed within sound governance frameworks that keep human judgement at the center. At the same time, too many controls can create friction, so it is essential to strike a careful balance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One sign this may already be happening: 64% of respondents said their organization has a process in place for assessing the security of AI tools before deploying them, up from 37% in the previous survey in the fall of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey data shows 77% of respondents said their organizations have adopted AI for cybersecurity, primarily to enhance phishing detection (52%), intrusion and anomaly response (46%), and user behavior analytics (40%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when asked about the practical challenges of adopting AI for cybersecurity, respondents listed insufficient knowledge and/or skills (54%), the need for human oversight (41%), and uncertainty about risk (39%) as the main hurdles. These findings indicate that trust is still a barrier to widespread AI adoption, the report concludes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As organizations navigate the integration of AI into their security operations, the balance between automation and human judgement becomes increasingly critical,” says the report. “While AI excels at automating repetitive, high-volume tasks, its current limitations in contextual judgement and strategic decision making remain clear. Over-reliance on ungoverned automation risks creating blind spots that adversaries may exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4045782/cybercrime-beyond-economics.html" target="_blank"&gt;Related content: Cybercrime is moving beyond financial gains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI continues to dominate the cybersecurity landscape, several other technologies and threat vectors are quietly gaining traction in the background and are expected to affect cybersecurity by 2030, says the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These include autonomous systems and robotics, quantum technologies, digital currencies, space technologies and undersea cables, and natural disasters and climate change. By the end of the decade, autonomous systems will be a near-term factor, from AI assisting in analysis to its directing of physical actions in factories, logistics, healthcare and public spaces. This evolution could create a new cyber‑physical risk profile, where machine‑executed decisions can alter safety and service quality within seconds, compressing detection and response windows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2030, quantum technology will have evolved from a theoretical disruptor into a selective but material threat to cryptography, the report predicts. State-level or well-resourced actors may be capable of quantum-accelerated attacks on high-value targets, even as full-scale code breaking remains rare. At the same time, defenders will harness quantum-enhanced analytics and sensing for anomaly detection, creating a dynamic attacker-defender race.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the report concludes, building a secure digital future requires more than technical solutions. “It calls for decisive leadership, shared accountability, and a commitment to lifting the collective baseline — ensuring that resilience is accessible to all, not just the most well-resourced. As the boundaries between digital and physical worlds continue to blur, the organizations that thrive will be those that recognize cyber resilience as a shared, strategic responsibility — one that underpins trust, enables innovation and safeguards the interconnected foundations of global society.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Security-KPIs und -KRIs: So messen Sie Cybersicherheit</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495619/security-kpis-und-kris-so-messen-sie-cybersicherheit.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cybersicherheit zu messen, ist kein Kinderspiel." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3357513/1200x.jpg" title="Cybersicherheit zu messen, ist kein Kinderspiel." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Cybersicherheit zu messen, ist kein Kinderspiel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: Ultraskrip – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eine wichtige Säule jedes ausgereiften Cyberrisk-Programms ist die Fähigkeit, die Performance der IT-Security und registrierte Bedrohungen zu messen, zu analysieren und zu melden. Die Cybersecurity zu messen, ist allerdings kein leichtes Unterfangen: Einerseits, weil sich viele Führungskräfte ohne entsprechenden Background schwer tun, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3498091/verantwortung-ubernehmen-so-werden-chefs-zu-security-vorbildern.html" target="_blank" title="IT-Risiken zu verstehen"&gt;IT-Risiken zu verstehen&lt;/a&gt;. Andererseits verstricken sich Sicherheitsprofis auch zu oft in technische Details, die die Stakeholder verwirren und auf den falschen Weg führen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ideale Szenario: Security-Experten messen und reporten die Cybersicherheit auf eine Art und Weise, die für Führungskräfte leicht verständlich und nützlich ist – was zu umsetzbaren Ergebnissen führt. Klingt gut? Dieser Artikel vermittelt Ihnen, wie Sie das anstellen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="messkategorien-der-it-sicherheit"&gt;Messkategorien der IT-Sicherheit&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die meisten &lt;a href="https://www.cio.de/a/so-identifizieren-sie-projektbeteiligte,3644693" target="_blank" title="Stakeholder"&gt;Stakeholder&lt;/a&gt; beschäftigen Fragen zu Risiken, Compliance oder Sicherheit. Diese lassen sich jedoch in der Regel nicht mit einem einzigen Datenpunkt beantworten. Doch es gibt eine Reihe von Dingen, die Security-Profis messen können, um auf die Fragen und Bedenken der Stakeholder einzugehen. Diese lassen sich (grob) in folgende Kategorien einordnen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kontrollen:&lt;/strong&gt; Maßnahmen, die ergriffen werden, um Bedrohungen abzuwehren und Risiken zu reduzieren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Jeder Gegenstand, der für die Organisation einen Wert besitzt, beziehungsweise sich in ihrem Besitz befindet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerabilities:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495294/schwachstellen-managen-die-6-besten-vulnerability-management-tools.html" target="_blank" title="Schwachstellen"&gt;Schwachstellen&lt;/a&gt; in einem System, die ausgenutzt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat Events:&lt;/strong&gt; Von einer Bedrohung ausgelöste Ereignisse, die Assets potenziell Schaden zufügen können.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sicherheitsvorfälle:&lt;/strong&gt; Ereignisse, die “erfolgreich” Wirkung auf das Unternehmen entfaltet haben, etwa in Form von (System-)Ausfällen, Datenschutzverletzungen oder &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3577944/diese-unternehmen-hats-schon-erwischt.html" target="_blank" title="Cyberangriffen"&gt;Cyberangriffen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Kategorien lassen sich weiter nach verschiedenen Faktoren aufschlüsseln: Zahlen, Zeit oder Kosten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zahlen&lt;/strong&gt; könnten beispielsweise in Form des Prozentsatzes der ungepatchten Server gemessen werden. Eine weitere Möglichkeit: Sie messen die &lt;strong&gt;Zeit&lt;/strong&gt;, die benötigt wurde, um einen Sicherheitsvorfall zu identifizieren. Schließlich könnten &lt;strong&gt;Kosten&lt;/strong&gt; – zum Beispiel in Form von Wiederherstellungs- oder Ausfallkosten – Aufschluss über die finanziellen Auswirkungen von Security-Ereignissen geben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cybersicherheits-metriken-kpis-und-kris"&gt;Cybersicherheits-Metriken, -KPIs und -KRIs&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Security-Profis oder -Entscheider an Business Teams berichten, sollten sie dazu möglichst relevante Messerwerte wählen. Dabei konzentrieren sich die meisten Sicherheitsteams auf Metriken, die Low-Level-Messungen bezüglich Assets, Schwachstellen und Threat Events abbilden. Auf Führungs- und Vorstandsebene sind hingegen vor allem &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2795253/die-wichtigste-security-kpi.html" target="_blank" title="KPIs"&gt;KPIs&lt;/a&gt; (Key Performance Indicators) und KRIs (Key Risk Indicators) entscheidend, weil diese dazu beitragen können, spezifische Fragen in Bezug auf IT-Risiko, -Status und -Vorbereitung zu beantworten. Beispielsweise: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sind wir sicher?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liefern die Sicherheitsinvestitionen dem Unternehmen Mehrwert?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erfüllen wir aus Sicherheitsperspektive alle regulatorischen Anforderungen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wie gut sind wir auf Ransomware- oder Supply-Chain-Angriffe vorbereitet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deshalb sollten sich Security-Praktiker auch auf KPIs und KRIs konzentrieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio foundryde-block"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper youtube-video"&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cybersecurity-messen-in-5-schritten"&gt;Cybersecurity messen in 5 Schritten&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Aufbau des richtigen Messrahmens ist ein schrittweiser, iterativer Prozess. Im Folgenden die fünf wichtigsten Schritte, um einen Security Measurement Cycle aufzubauen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Anforderungen definieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sprechen Sie mit relevanten Stakeholdern, um deren Bedürfnisse zu definieren und zu verstehen. Diese haben zu diesem Zeitpunkt möglicherweise noch kein umfassendes Verständnis über IT-Risiken – oder ihre eigenen Anforderungen. Deshalb ist für Security-Praktiker ein Bottom-Up-Ansatz empfehlenswert, bei dem sie selbst die Initiative ergreifen und Fragen zu stellen, um die Anforderungen definieren zu können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Key Indicators auswählen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sobald die Anforderungen der Stakeholder definiert sind, sollten Sicherheitsexperten diejenigen Key Indicators auswählen, die auf diese einzahlen. Dabei sollten die Stakeholder konsultiert und über die beabsichtigten, späteren Messungen informiert werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn die Stakeholder die Key Indicators kennen, können sie Maßnahmen ergreifen oder Entscheidungen treffen. Die Schlüsselindikatoren sollten auf hoher Ebene angesiedelt sein – und ihre Anzahl überschaubar bleiben. Das Ziel besteht schließlich darin, die Entscheidungsfindung zu erleichtern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Metriken identifizieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nachdem Ziele und Key Indicators festgelegt sind, gilt es für die Sicherheitsteams, die Low-Level-Messgrößen zu fokussieren, die dabei unterstützen, die Indikatoren zu reporten. Das kann – je nach Art des Indikators – bedeuten, dass Dutzende von Metriken aus den verschiedenen oben beschriebenen Messkategorien erforderlich sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Metriken sammeln und analysieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Da die Anforderungen nun feststehen, die Schlüsselindikatoren ausgewählt und die Messgrößen festgelegt sind, können die Praktiker nun damit beginnen, Daten auf dieser Grundlage zu sammeln und zu analysieren. Metriken dürfen dabei nur aus Daten abgeleitet werden, die akkurat, aktuell, relevant und vertrauenswürdig sind. Anderenfalls kann es zu Entscheidungen kommen, die schwerwiegende Folgen für die Sicherheitslage des Unternehmens nach sich ziehen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es ist die Aufgabe der Security-Teams, Wege zu finden, Daten kontinuierlich zu sammeln (die meisten Messungen erfordern einen Überblick über Trends im Zeitverlauf) und den Prozess vorzugsweise so weit wie möglich zu automatisieren (ein manueller Prozess kann ermüdend und zeitaufwändig sein).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Key Indicators reporten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key Indicators müssen zeitnah an die Entscheidungsträger reported werden. Dabei sollten sich Security-Profis und Stakeholder auf einen zeitlichen Rhythmus einigen – ebenso wie über die Art der Berichterstattung: Sind Dashboards erforderlich oder reichen Powerpoint-Präsentationen aus? Die Schlüsselindikatoren sollten deutlich sichtbar und leicht verständlich sein, um zu Entscheidungen oder Maßnahmen zu führen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus ist es wichtig, nach jedem Berichtszyklus die Key Indicators zu überprüfen und sie (unter Einbeziehung der Stakeholder) neu zu bewerten. Haben sich die geschäftlichen Anforderungen tatsächlich geändert, müssen die Anforderungen erneut definiert und ein anderer Satz von Indikatoren und Messgrößen erarbeitet werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen, Stakeholder und Sicherheitsexperten sollten keine Angst vor Rückwärts- oder Vorwärtsschritten haben: Die Fähigkeit, nach einem schnellen Fail direkt weiterzumachen, zu improvisieren oder sich neu auszurichten sind entscheidende Fähigkeiten, wenn es darum geht, Cybersicherheit erfolgreich zu messen.

      <title>Cybercrime Inc.: When hackers are better organized than IT</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116508/cybercrime-inc-when-hackers-are-better-organized-than-it.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What once began in forums with self-written malware has evolved into a globally networked underground economy that surpasses many companies in efficiency, speed, and scalability. Hacker groups today divide labor, utilize distribution channels, provide support, share revenue with partners, and invest in research and development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The crucial question is no longer whether a company will be the target of an attack, but how long it remains at a standstill after an attack — and whether it is able to recover from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="structured-shadow-industry"&gt;Structured shadow industry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercrime has transformed from isolated incidents into an organized industry. The large groups operate according to the same principles as international corporations. They have departments, processes, management levels, and KPIs. They develop software, maintain customer databases, and evaluate their success rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attacks have long since adopted a business logic. Behind every phishing campaign, every data leak, and every extortion attempt lies a meticulously organized supply chain. Developers deliver malware, access brokers sell login credentials, logistics providers supply servers, and communications specialists negotiate ransoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This gave rise to an efficient shadow economy with enormous scalability. Sales take place via closed forums, payments via cryptocurrencies, and accounting via encrypted communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomware-as-a-service-the-amazon-of-crime"&gt;Ransomware-as-a-service: The Amazon of crime&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/559049/ransomware-as-a-service-fuels-explosive-growth.html"&gt;ransomware-as-a-service&lt;/a&gt; (RaaS) model has also revolutionized the cybercrime business. Criminal groups offer their malware like a software product. Attackers can license the code, select targets, and launch attacks — all without in-depth programming knowledge. The operator receives a commission for this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus, a marketplace developed where services, tools, and data are traded like products. Access costs a fee, but updates are included. There are manuals, discounts, and support forums. Even the marketing is professionally done: “Reliable decryption, fast response, fair distribution” — these are advertising slogans on the darknet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The parallels to the legitimate economy are striking. Partnerships, distribution networks, and bonus schemes exist. Ransomware is no longer an isolated incident, but a sophisticated business model with a clear profit strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attack-as-a-service"&gt;Attack as a service&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercrime now functions like a service chain. Anyone planning an attack today can purchase all the necessary components — from initial access credentials to leak management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access brokers sell access to corporate networks. Botnet operators provide computing power for attacks. Developers deliver turnkey exploits tailored to known vulnerabilities. Communication specialists handle contact with the victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this parallel economy, almost any role can be outsourced. The effect is the same scaling that has made legal platform companies strong — only operating in the shadow of the law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-role-of-states"&gt;The role of states&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, state-tolerated or actively controlled groups are interfering in this ecosystem. Attacks on energy suppliers, hospitals, and public administration institutions demonstrate that cybercrime has long since become part of geopolitical power strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lines between criminal and state actors are blurring. Certain groups operate under the protection of regimes or on their behalf. This creates hybrid structures that intertwine economic interests, political goals, and criminal profits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This development makes the situation particularly critical. Cyberattacks today not only threaten IT systems, but also supply chain, public order, and economic stability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="efficient-attackers"&gt;Efficient attackers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes cybercrime so dangerous today is not just the technology itself, but the efficiency of its use. Attackers are flexible, networked, and eager to experiment. They test, discard, and improve — in cycles that are almost unimaginable in a corporate setting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recruitment is handled like in startups. Job offers for developers, social engineers, or language specialists circulate in darknet forums. There are performance bonuses, training, and career paths. The work methods are agile, communication is decentralized, and financial motivation is clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These structures create a pressure for innovation that extends far beyond technical attacks. Cybercrime groups are investing in AI, automation, and machine learning. They analyze data to exploit vulnerabilities in a targeted manner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="slow-defenders"&gt;Slow defenders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation is different for those who are attacked. Many companies operate in defensive mode — slowly, bureaucratically, and often reactively. Security concepts are reviewed annually, but attacks are adapted daily. On average, over 200 days pass between an attack and its detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This lag doesn’t stem from ignorance, but from structures. While criminals operate independently, companies have to check compliance, approve budgets, and clarify responsibilities. The attackers profit from the inertia of their victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk is not a lack of technology, but a lack of responsiveness. This makes &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2111061/cyber-resilience-a-business-imperative-cisos-must-get-right.html"&gt;cyber resilience a crucial factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="humans-as-a-gateway"&gt;Humans as a gateway&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 80% of all successful attacks begin with human error. Phishing, social engineering, and manipulated chat messages remain the easiest ways to infiltrate networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the quality of these deception attempts has changed dramatically. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3850783/11-ways-cybercriminals-are-making-phishing-more-potent-than-ever.html"&gt;Thanks to AI advances&lt;/a&gt;, cybercriminals’ social engineering emails, voice recordings, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt; appear authentic. Even experienced employees can hardly detect attacks anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;Security awareness&lt;/a&gt; must therefore no longer be seen as a bothersome obligation. It must be part of the corporate culture. Only those who understand attacks as an everyday risk can react appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-as-weapons"&gt;Data as weapons&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware groups today rely on double and triple extortion. First, systems are encrypted, then data is stolen, and finally sensitive information is published if no ransom is paid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about money, but about reputational damage. Confidential communications, confidential research results, or personal data are deliberately published to generate maximum pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This mechanism makes cybercrime a modern form of industrial espionage. Any piece of information can become a weapon, any company a target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-ai-race"&gt;The AI ​​race&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is an accelerator on both sides. Criminals use AI to perfect phishing, optimize malicious code, and bypass security mechanisms. At the same time, defenders use AI systems to detect anomalies and automatically isolate incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the dynamics are asymmetrical. Attackers can experiment freely, without regulatory or ethical constraints. Defenders, on the other hand, must consider data protection, liability, and compliance. This imbalance gives cybercrime groups a constant speed advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is foreseeable: fully automated attack chains that make decisions in real-time based on machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-prevention-to-resilience"&gt;From prevention to resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given this development, absolute security is unattainable. The crucial factor is the ability to quickly regain operational capability after an attack. Cyber ​​resilience describes this competence — not only to survive crises but also to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A resilient company knows its critical processes, regularly tests recovery plans, and has a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3851840/prepared-for-cyberattacks-crisis-communication-according-to-plan.html"&gt;clear communication strategy&lt;/a&gt;. Incident response teams &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829684/how-to-create-an-effective-incident-response-plan.html"&gt;must be trained before an emergency occurs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about technology. Leadership, decision-making ability, and internal transparency are key success factors. Those who communicate during a crisis, instead of remaining silent, maintain control and trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-as-an-asset"&gt;Security as an asset&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, cybersecurity should no longer be seen as a cost factor, but rather as a strategic capability. It not only protects systems, but also safeguards competitiveness, customer data, and brand value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increasing professionalism of attackers forces companies to become more professional themselves — in structures, processes, and mindset. Only those who integrate security into the DNA of their organization can survive in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2026, cybercrime will no longer be a temporary risk, but a permanent part of the economic ecosystem. Companies that are prepared will survive. The others will become part of a statistic that grows year after year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercrime has adapted to the rules of the digital economy — efficiency, networking, automation. While many companies still think in outdated security paradigms, a global industry has long since formed underground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It acts faster, is more adaptable, and more uncompromising. The difference between victim and survivor no longer lies in defense, but in the ability to get back on their feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>US cybersecurity weakened by congressional delays despite Plankey renomination</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116477/us-cybersecurity-weakened-by-congressional-delays-despite-plankey-renomination.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/nominations-sent-to-the-senate-078c/"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; to restart an urgent stalled priority by renominating well-regarded Coast Guard and Energy Department cyber veteran Sean Plankey as CISA director. Experts say the step offers some relief but does not go far enough to resolve the broader congressional inaction still straining the nation’s cyber defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some have faulted the White House for a lack of engagement in cyber issues and their advancement through Congress, while others say congressional dysfunction is the larger problem. Referring to the Trump administration’s broader approach to cyber policy, &lt;a href="https://www.csis.org/people/james-andrew-lewis"&gt;Jim Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, SVP and director of the technology and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), tells CSO, “Cyber isn’t a priority for these guys.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.venable.com/professionals/s/ari-schwartz"&gt;Ari Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;, managing director of cybersecurity services at Venable, views Congress as the greater culprit. “It is very difficult to get bills passed in Congress, and it turns out it’s very difficult to get some of these nominees through as well, even when they have bipartisan support. That signals we cannot get stuff done and is extremely problematic,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Problems stemming from inaction across these areas could begin to emerge as soon as next month and compound thereafter if no further action is taken. Some experts are hopeful Congress or the administration will step in to address the lapses, although they warn solutions will not emerge quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cisa-leadership-swift-confirmation-needed-to-limit-damage"&gt;CISA leadership: Swift confirmation needed to limit damage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end of the year for Congress on Dec. 31 allowed &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3844343/trump-nominates-cyber-vet-sean-plankey-for-cisa-chief-amid-doge-cuts-and-firings.html"&gt;the nomination&lt;/a&gt; of Plankey &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/12/senate-adjourns-without-confirming-cisa-director/410345/"&gt;to lapse&lt;/a&gt;, requiring a new nomination process. Experts say the longer Plankey waits for confirmation, the more adrift CISA and US cyber policy will be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid budget cuts driven by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3844047/cisa-cybersecurity-workforce-faces-cuts-amid-shifting-us-strategy.html"&gt;sharply reduced CISA’s staffing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829710/firing-of-130-cisa-staff-worries-cybersecurity-industry.html"&gt;and institutional capacity&lt;/a&gt;, the ongoing lack of leadership at CISA accelerated the loss of invaluable expertise and created a three-level cybersecurity failure — internal, domestic, and international — for the US, according to &lt;a href="https://securityandtechnology.org/person/meganstifel/"&gt;Megan Stifel&lt;/a&gt;, chief strategy officer at the Institute for Security and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Not having confirmed leadership undermines CISA’s ability to meet its statutory obligations,” Stifel tells CSO. She adds that the lack of confirmed leadership complicates interagency coordination and weakens US credibility on critical infrastructure security abroad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with Plankey’s renomination, the damage caused by the prolonged leadership vacuum at the agency will still take time to rectify, according to CSIS’s Lewis. “They already hollowed out CISA, right? One CISA person who just left the agency told me that 40% of the career staff was gone. There’s not going to be a team to hand off to. They’ll need to do a lot of rebuilding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), Plankey’s renomination came none too soon. Speaking &lt;a href="https://mccraryinstitute.com/event/protecting-against-the-prc/"&gt;at an event&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the McCrary Institute on Dec. 16, Garbarino said he was disappointed that Plankey’s nomination had languished but that he would be confirmed “hopefully soon.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Confirmation holds on both sides of the aisle in the Senate played a significant part in the failure to confirm Plankey. Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) blocked Plankey’s nomination due to &lt;a href="https://cyberscoop.com/sean-plankey-cisa-nomination-stalled-senate-holds/"&gt;a Coast Guard issue&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) &lt;a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-places-hold-on-top-cybersecurity-nominee-to-force-release-of-important-details-on-security-threats-to-us-phone-networks"&gt;held up&lt;/a&gt; Plankey’s nomination to force CISA to release an unclassified report on telephone network security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2025-07-30/senate-committee-advances-trump-nominee-to-lead-cybersecurity-agency-that-protects-election-systems"&gt;promised in July&lt;/a&gt; that it would release the report, but has yet to do so. Keith Chu, a spokesperson for Wyden, tells CSO the senator will continue to object to confirming any CISA director until the telecommunications security report is released.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cisa-2015-reauthorization-likely-but-late-and-suboptimal"&gt;CISA 2015 reauthorization: Likely, but late and suboptimal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major cybersecurity bill called the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4065998/cisa-2015-cyber-threat-info-sharing-law-lapses-amid-government-shutdown.html"&gt;Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015&lt;/a&gt; (CISA 2015), which expired on Sept. 30, was &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr5371/BILLS-119hr5371eas.pdf#page=26"&gt;temporarily revived&lt;/a&gt; on Nov. 13 and given a two-month lease on life through Jan. 30, 2026. The law provides critical legal liability protections that enable cyber threat information sharing among organizations and the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The short-term extension seemed to ensure a longer-term renewal of the legislation, as lawmakers, the administration, and industry broadly agree that failure to extend the legal liability protection under CISA 2015 is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important,” US Representative Garbarino said at the McCrary event. “It is imperative that it gets passed, and it gets extended. I don’t know how it gets done on its own. I feel like we have to attach it to another must-pass piece as legislation, whether that’s government funding, but we need it passed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, CISA Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy tells CSO, “Reauthorizing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 is vital to sustaining this progress — enabling industry and government to share information, respond to incidents, and mitigate cyber risks with speed and precision.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;White House National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross has &lt;a href="https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/cybersecurity/national-cyber-director-outlines-vision-for-new-cybersecurity-strategy/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “I just want to be abundantly clear that we are for, and the White House is for, a 10-year clean reauthorization of CISA 2015.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this tight level of agreement and support, odds are good that Congress will eventually reauthorize the legislation, although it is likely to be less than the 10-year renewal period advocates of the bill’s reauthorization seek.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our colleagues in the Senate have different ideas,” Garbarino said. “Some of them want to do a 10-year clean reauthorization. I don’t know if I can get that passed in the House with concerns from the Freedom Caucus chairman,” &lt;a href="https://clayhiggins.house.gov/2025/09/03/higgins-leads-freedom-caucus-letter-urging-house-leadership-not-to-rush-cisa-reauthorization/"&gt;Andy Harris&lt;/a&gt; (R-MD), who has urged a go-slow approach to CISA 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if Garbarino gets CISA 2015 through the House, some experts say a clean reauthorization would likely still be opposed by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Rand Paul (R-KY), who &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/10/rand-paul-blocks-senate-extension-of-cyber-information-sharing-law-00597017"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; the Senate from passing a bill to extend the law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="state-and-local-cyber-grants-effectively-dead-for-now"&gt;State and local cyber grants: Effectively dead for now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A murky picture emerges for another piece of unfinished business in Congress: a state and local cybersecurity grant program (SLCGP) &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybergrants/slcgp"&gt;administered&lt;/a&gt; by CISA. Most of the remaining funds in the $1 billion program were hollowed out via Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency in early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In November, the House of Representatives passed the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/5078"&gt;PILLAR Act,&lt;/a&gt; which extended the program until 2033, but did not specifically allocate a dollar amount for future grants. Chairman Garbarino thinks there’s a good chance that the SLCGP could get funded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I have a great partner on appropriations, Chairman Amodei,” he said at the McCrary event, referring to Mark Amodei (R-NV), who is Chairman of the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee. “We’re trying to find a vehicle to attach it to and get it done.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experienced Washington hands, such as CSIS’s Lewis, are skeptical. “I don’t think they’re [the state and local grants] ever coming back,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-will-washington-move-forward"&gt;When will Washington move forward?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether or when the remaining unresolved issues might move forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think the Congress is probably going to do the right thing, but it will take longer because you don’t have executive branch leadership,” Lewis says. “Then they still have to [understand where] the White House is coming from, which is no money, no new authorities, and smaller agencies, before they can get anything in place. If we’re lucky, we’ll see it before the summer break, but it’s going to be a slow process.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that &lt;a href="https://cyberscoop.com/trump-national-cybersecurity-strategy-2025-release/"&gt;an upcoming&lt;/a&gt; White House cybersecurity strategy might touch on some of these programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some experts say the bipartisan nature of cybersecurity gives them hope. “Cybersecurity and, particularly, protecting critical infrastructure and defending US networks, remain a bipartisan issue,” Schwartz says. “That makes me feel better about the possibility of getting to a point where we are moving forward again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The White House’s March 2025 Executive Order (EO) on “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/achieving-efficiency-through-state-and-local-preparedness/"&gt;Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness&lt;/a&gt;” raised an issue of utmost importance for national security and our critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As noted in the order, “federal policy must rightly recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the state, local and even individual levels, supported by a competent, accessible and efficient federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite claims from various cybersecurity leaders that the March EO is a federal retreat on information technology security, has funding gaps and lacks implementation clarity and expertise at the local level, the president is correct: Local jurisdictions are best positioned to anticipate their electronic security needs, understand their unique weaknesses, vulnerabilities and risks, and are best suited to develop and implement an incident response, mitigation and recovery plan based on their unique circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Congress is right, too. In 2021, it established the State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP) to “award grants to eligible entities to address cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity threats to information systems owned or operated by, or on behalf of, state, local or tribal governments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SLCGP authorizes $1 billion over four years to help state, local, tribal and territorial governments reduce systemic cyber risks and requires a pass-through of at least 80 percent of those funds to local governments, while reserving 25 percent of those funds for rural jurisdictions. A key component of the SLCGP ties any disbursement of funds to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency’s (CISA) approval of a state’s cybersecurity plan. That proposal must meet the requirements set forth in the SLCGP, such as implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This September, the Homeland Security Committee — with bipartisan support — introduced the Protecting Information by Local Leaders for Agency Resilience Act(PILLAR Act, H.R. 5078), which seeks to not only extend SLCGP for 10 years, but also provide long‑term stability and funding, strengthen milestone‑based accountability, expand its scope to AI and operational technology, and clarify cost‑sharing between federal and state governments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combined, the March 2025 EO and the SLCGP create a framework that will succeed if implemented in tandem. Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. In January 2025, the Office of Management and Budget directed all federal agencies to “temporarily pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all federal financial assistance.” This effectively ended all SLCGP disbursements and left it and the EO as unfunded mandates. But that’s not quite where this story ends. As part of the re-opening of the government in November, the SLCGP was potentially resurrected when its authorization was extended to January 30. This is a crucially important development. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to act and bring SLCGP fully back to life through the PILLAR Act. With our adversaries already embedded in our critical infrastructure (see Salt and Volt Typhoon, advanced persistent threat actors tied to China’s government), and the recent deployment of AI as a cyber-super-weapon — as demonstrated by Anthropic’s recent announcement of how its Claude AI was manipulated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers to conduct a large-scale attack executed almost entirely by AI agents — states and local jurisdictions are even more vulnerable. This is not simply a matter of funding; it’s a matter of national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There should not be much debate as to whether states will utilize SLCGP effectively; they already have the data. As of August 1, 2024, according to the Government Accountability Office, “the Department of Homeland Security provided approximately $172 million in grants to 33 states and territories” and “[t]he grants are funding 839 state and local cybersecurity projects that align with core cybersecurity functions as defined by [NIST],” including developing cybersecurity plans and policies, employing cybersecurity contractors, upgrading equipment and implementing multi-factor authentication. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The passage of the PILLAR Act will also enhance CISA’s reach, even with its reduced workforce and limited resources, by making it a force multiplier because it can now focus on oversight — approving state cybersecurity tactics, setting standards and guiding and monitoring priorities — while state, local and tribal governments execute the day-to-day implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not mentioned in the PILLAR Act, but something practical and easily executed as part of the SLCGP, is local governments partnering with private and public universities to tap into a pipeline of students trained in cybersecurity strategy (e.g., law, policy, risk management, governance) and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, resulting in lower costs for the local governments, hands-on experience for students and community building and outreach between local governments and universities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PILLAR Act has bipartisan support, and the president’s March 2025 EO reinforces everything contained within it. We now have the framework for securing our state, local and tribal governments. Let’s get this done immediately, as the stakes have never been higher and our national security depends on it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CrowdStrike to add browser security to Falcon with Seraphic acquisition</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116703/crowdstrike-to-add-browser-security-to-falcon-with-seraphic-acquisition.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike has agreed to acquire Israel-based Seraphic Security, a browser runtime security company, to extend its Falcon platform to browser-native enterprise security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Expected to close by April, the acquisition will allow CrowdStrike to integrate Seraphic’s browser-native protection with its Falcon endpoint telemetry and threat intelligence capabilities. The move comes just days after CrowdStrike announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114957/crowdstrike-to-acquire-sgnl-for-740m-expanding-real-time-identity-security.html" target="_blank"&gt;acquire&lt;/a&gt; SGNL, a continuous identity authorization company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="browser-as-attack-surface"&gt;Browser as attack surface&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With web browsers increasingly serving as the primary interface for enterprise work, communication, SaaS applications, and AI tools, they are emerging as one of the most exposed layers in corporate IT environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Traditional endpoint controls like EDR focus on the OS level and miss in-session browser activity, while network tools like firewalls can’t inspect HTTPS-encrypted sessions or user actions within apps. They lack visibility into browser telemetry, shadow IT, malicious extensions, and data flows, leaving gaps that attackers exploit via phishing, session hijacking, and zero-days,” said &lt;a href="https://ankura.com/experts-and-advisors/amit-jaju" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amit Jaju&lt;/a&gt;, global partner/senior managing director – India at Ankura Consulting. He added that web browsers pose risks even in controlled environments because they inherently process untrusted internet code, enabling zero-day exploits, malicious extensions acting as supply chain attacks, and credential theft that bypasses perimeter defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike &lt;a href="https://ir.crowdstrike.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crowdstrike-acquire-seraphic-turning-any-browser-secure" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Seraphic acquisition will allow it to extend the Falcon platform deeper into in-browser activity.  With Seraphic, the company aims to transform the SOC by correlating trillions of endpoint signals with deep, in-session browser telemetry. This will allow the Falcon platform to understand user intent, application context, and data flow in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seraphic’s true USP lies in its ability to make the browser session itself a governable security surface, rather than treating the browser as a passive extension of the endpoint,” said &lt;a href="https://greyhoundresearch.com/svg/"&gt;Sanchit Vir Gogia&lt;/a&gt;, chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “Most enterprise security stacks stop at device health and identity validation. They confirm who logged in and from what device, but they lose visibility once the user begins interacting inside SaaS applications. Seraphic addresses this by enforcing policy inside the live browser session, covering user actions, session behaviour, and data movement that never touches disk and never triggers network anomalies. When integrated into CrowdStrike Falcon, it moves from detecting threats around user activity to governing behaviour during it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gen-ai-altering-browser-risk"&gt;Gen AI altering browser risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative AI has fundamentally altered the browser risk profile. Gogia noted that the browser is now a bidirectional data exchange, where employees routinely feed sensitive context into AI systems. Most of this activity happens outside formal enterprise governance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copying internal data into AI prompts, uploading files for summarisation, or using AI-enhanced browser features has become one of the fastest-growing data leakage paths in organisations. As a result, browser-level enforcement is one of the few practical ways to address this without resorting to unrealistic bans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike will also integrate SGNL’s continuous authorization technology, enabling permissions to be dynamically granted or revoked on a per-session and risk-level basis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two solutions combined will create what the company described as a unified security fabric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The integration will be designed to secure how generative AI applications and agents are accessed, to prevent shadow AI tools from scraping or exfiltrating sensitive enterprise data. It will also aim to prevent the copying, uploading, or screen-grabbing of sensitive data using AI-based content filtering and granular execution-layer controls, stop session hijacking, sophisticated phishing, and man-in-the-browser attacks at the point of execution by randomizing the browser’s JavaScript engine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, CrowdStrike will extend protection to unmanaged and BYOD devices by securing the browser session without requiring a full endpoint agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>SpyCloud Launches Supply Chain Solution to Combat Rising Third-Party Identity Threats</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116536/spycloud-launches-supply-chain-solution-to-combat-rising-third-party-identity-threats.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SpyCloud&lt;/a&gt;, the leader in identity threat protection, today announced the launch of its &lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain Threat Protection&lt;/strong&gt; solution, an advanced layer of defense that expands identity threat protection across the extended workforce, including organizations’ entire vendor ecosystems. Unlike traditional third-party risk management platforms that rely on external surface indicators and static scoring, &lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/products/supply-chain-threat-protection/?utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_source=cybernewswire&amp;amp;utm_campaign=supply-chain-launch-2026" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SpyCloud Supply Chain Threat Protection&lt;/a&gt; provides timely access to identity threats derived from billions of recaptured breach, malware, phished, and combolist data assets, empowering organizations – from enterprise security teams to public sector agencies – to act on credible threats rather than simply observe and accept risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supply Chain Threat Protection addresses a critical gap in enterprise security: the inability to maintain real-time awareness of identity exposures affecting third-party partners and vendors. According to the 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, &lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/blog/verizon-2025-data-breach-report-insights/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;third-party involvement in breaches&lt;/a&gt; doubled year-over-year, jumping from 15% to 30% primarily due to software vulnerabilities and weak security practices. As supply chain compromises continue to escalate, security teams need intelligence that goes beyond questionnaires and external scans to reveal active threats like phishing campaigns targeting their trusted partners, confirmed credential theft, and malware-infected devices exposing critical business applications to criminals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wo7MqWbUCZ4?utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_source=cybernewswire&amp;amp;utm_content=video&amp;amp;utm_campaign=supply-chain-launch-2026"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper youtube-video"&gt;
 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For government agencies and critical infrastructure operators, supply chain threats present national security risks that demand heightened vigilance. Public sector organizations managing sensitive data and critical services increasingly rely on contractors and technology vendors whose compromised credentials could provide adversaries with pathways into classified systems or essential infrastructure. Last year alone, the top 98 &lt;a href="https://engage.spycloud.com/rs/713-WIP-737/images/spycloud-2025-infographic-DIB.pdf?_gl=1*29lkhl*_gcl_au*MzgxMTg0NjkyLjE3NjE5MjE3NTg." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Defense Industrial Base suppliers&lt;/a&gt; had over 11,000 dark web exposed credentials – an 81% increase from the previous year. SpyCloud Supply Chain Threat Protection enables federal, state, and local agencies to identify when suppliers or contractors have been compromised – allowing them to take proactive measures before an identity exposure escalates into a matter of national security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Third-party threats have evolved far beyond what traditional vendor assessment tools can detect,” said Damon Fleury, Chief Product Officer at SpyCloud. “Public and private sector organizations need to know when their vendors’ employees are actively compromised by malware or phishes, when authentication data is circulating on the dark web, and which partners pose the greatest real downstream threat to their business. Our new solution delivers those signals by transforming raw underground data into clear, prioritized actions that security teams use to protect their organization.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supply Chain Threat Protection enables organizations and agencies to continuously monitor thousands of suppliers, with each company’s threats enumerated in detail, and also represented in an at-a-glance Identity Threat Index. The Index is a comprehensive and continuously updated analysis that quantifies vendor security posture through the lens of identity exposure, from both active and historical phishing, breach, and malware sources, and surfaces which partners pose the most significant risk based on verified dark web intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Capabilities Include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Evidence of Compromise:&lt;/strong&gt; Timely recaptured identity data from breaches, malware, and successful phishes collected continuously from the criminal underground, with context that gives security teams enhanced visibility into the identity threats facing suppliers today.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity Threat Index:&lt;/strong&gt; Aggregates multiple verified data sources weighted by the recency, volume, credibility, and severity of compromise, emphasizing verified identity data over static breach records for more robust and real-time visibility into vendor risk.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compromised Applications&lt;/strong&gt;: Identifies the internal and third-party business applications exposed on malware-infected supplier devices to support deeper investigation and risk assessment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Vendor Management and Communications:&lt;/strong&gt; Facilitates sharing of actionable evidence and detailed executive-level reports directly with vendors to collaboratively improve security posture, transforming vendor relationships from adversarial scoring to collaborative protection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Response: &lt;/strong&gt;Leveraging SpyCloud’s console, teams now have access to identity threat protection beyond the traditional employee perimeter with this extension to suppliers, allowing analysts to respond to workforce identity threats within a single tool. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SpyCloud Supply Chain Threat Protection is designed to support multiple use cases across Security Operations, Infosec, Vendor Risk Management, and GRC teams. Organizations can leverage the solution for vendor due diligence during procurement and onboarding, continuous risk reviews to strengthen vendor relationships, and accelerated incident response when vendor exposures threaten their own environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security teams and their counterparts across the business are overwhelmed with vendor assessments, questionnaires, and risk scores that often don’t translate to real prevention,” said Alex Greer, Group Product Manager at SpyCloud. “Our customers have often reported that when they’re evaluating doing business with a new vendor, they lack the actionable data their legal and compliance teams need for evidence-based decision making. That’s where SpyCloud stands out. Surfacing verified identity threats tied directly to vendor compromise, letting teams escalate to leadership when to restrict data access and prioritize efforts for the greatest impact on reducing organizational risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike existing solutions that rely on external surface indicators and static scoring, SpyCloud provides threat data derived from underground sources – the same recaptured darknet identity data that criminals actively use to target organizations and agencies. This fundamental difference enables SpyCloud customers to move from passive risk acceptance to proactive and holistic identity threat protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To learn more about defending organizations from the exposures of vendors and suppliers, registration is open for SpyCloud’s upcoming Live Virtual Event, &lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/events/how-to-solve-the-hidden-identity-crisis-in-your-supply-chain/?utm_medium=pr&amp;amp;utm_source=cybernewswire&amp;amp;utm_campaign=supply-chain-launch-2026" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Vendor Risk Scores: How to Solve the Hidden Identity Crisis in Your Supply Chain, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, January 22, 2026, at 11 am CT&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About SpyCloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SpyCloud transforms recaptured darknet data to disrupt cybercrime. Its automated identity threat protection solutions leverage advanced analytics and AI to proactively prevent ransomware and account takeover, detect insider threats, safeguard employee and consumer identities, and accelerate cybercrime investigations. SpyCloud’s data from breaches, malware-infected devices, and successful phishes also powers many popular dark web monitoring and identity theft protection offerings.
