      <title>10 promising cybersecurity startups CISOs should know about</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080699/10-promising-cybersecurity-startups-cisos-should-know-about.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming up with an accurate head count for cybersecurity startups is virtually impossible, with a new ventures popping up seemingly every day. And there’s no industry standard for how many years it takes before a startup should cease being called a startup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, industry veteran Richard Stiennon, who tracks cybersecurity vendors on his &lt;a href="https://dashboard.it-harvest.com/"&gt;IT-Harvest dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, lists more than 4,000 companies in the cybersecurity sector, startup or not, including more than 170 AI security vendors alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this article, we have set 2020 as a cutoff for defining a startup, so any vendor founded before then has been excluded from consideration. Because there are dozens of startups worthy of note, we’ve also decided that highlighting a cross-section of vendors with different areas of focus is worthwhile given the range of cyber work undertaken by cyber startups today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In otherwise determining this list, criteria include the amount of venture capital raised, acquisitions (if any), management team, awards recognition, and the company’s ability to articulate a clear strategic vision that resonates with enterprise security professionals, CISOs particularly. Virtually all these vendors are privately held, but those that announce strong revenue growth and customer wins get extra points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-astrix-security"&gt;1. Astrix Security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-human identity (NHI) security&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: For every human user in an enterprise, there could be dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2132294/what-are-non-human-identities-and-why-do-they-matter.html"&gt;non-human identities executing machine-to-machine interactions&lt;/a&gt;. These include API keys, service accounts, and AI agents making autonomous decisions. Astrix argues that these &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3476130/nhis-may-be-your-biggest-and-most-neglected-security-hole.html"&gt;NHIs constitute a blind spot&lt;/a&gt; in most enterprise security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astrix provides visibility into non-human identities, and automatically detects and remediates overprivileged, unnecessary, and malicious access to prevent supply chain attacks and data leaks. Founded in 2021 by two veterans of the Israel Defense Force military intelligence unit, CEO Alon Jackson and CTO Idan Gour, Astrix has raised $85M in funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://menlovc.com/team/rama-sekhar/"&gt;Rama Sekhar&lt;/a&gt;, a partner at Menlo Ventures, says, “Astrix is tackling the challenge of securing non-human identities head-on by addressing the full lifecycle of NHIs, ensuring that enterprises can automate confidently and securely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-chainguard"&gt;2. Chainguard&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Software supply chain security&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 2021 by Dan Lorenc (formerly at Microsoft and Google), Chainguard offers a Linux-based platform for securely building applications. The company has raised more than $600M and is valued at $3.5B. In fiscal year 2025, Chainguard reached a $40M annual run rate and by the end of fiscal 2026, expects to hit $100M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chainguard automated build system, Chainguard Factory, includes Chainguard OS, which it describes as “zero-trust immutable infrastructure.” The platform includes libraries, as well as more than 1,700 trusted container images. Chainguard recently extended the platform to virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/investors/mamoon-hamid/"&gt;Mamoon Hamid&lt;/a&gt;, partner at Kleiner Perkins, says, “The speed at which Chainguard has established itself as the go-to provider for trusted open-source software is remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-cyera"&gt;3. Cyera&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category: &lt;/strong&gt;Data security posture management (DSPM)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 2021 by Israeli military veterans Yota Segev (CEO) and Tamar Bar-Ilan (CTO), New York-headquartered Cyera has raised an astounding $1.3B, including $540M in Series E funding in June. The company is valued at $6B.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyera is taking a platform approach to data security in the age of AI. The company just bought Israeli data loss prevention (DLP) startup Trail Security for $162M to help fill out its portfolio.  On top of its core products, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3518733/ai-spm-buyers-guide-artificial-intelligence-security-posture-management-tools-compared.html"&gt;AI-SPM&lt;/a&gt;, which inventories AI assets, and AI Runtime Protection, which monitors and responds to AI risks in real-time, Cyera recently launched AI Guardian, aimed at securing any type of AI, as well as DataWatcher, a managed SPM service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickbackhouse/"&gt;Patrick Backhouse&lt;/a&gt;, partner at Greenoaks, “We believe Cyera has built the world’s best data security platform, with a classification engine that is dramatically better than the rules-based paradigm, and which has earned genuine love from CISOs across industries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-drata"&gt;4. Drata&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; AI-powered governance, risk, compliance (GRC)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Drata has achieved 60% year-over-year growth and hit $100M in annual recurring revenue with its security compliance automation platform. Drata says it has attracted more than 7,000 global customers since its founding in 2020. Earlier this year, Drata acquired SafeBase, which automates software security reviews, for $250M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drata’s vision is a trust management platform that not only changes GRC from a manual to an automated process, but also transforms GRC from a cost center to a business accelerator. The company has launched an AI agent as well as the Drata Model Context Protocol (MCP). The goal is a fully agentic platform where AI agents act on behalf of end users to evaluate risks, validate evidence, trigger workflows, and manage trust autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-island"&gt;5. Island&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Secure enterprise browser&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Browsers might not be as exciting as AI, but a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573875/secure-web-browsers-for-the-enterprise-compared-how-to-pick-the-right-one.html"&gt;secure enterprise browser&lt;/a&gt; is becoming an important element in a layered defense. Gartner predicts that “by 2028, 25% of organizations will augment existing secure remote access and endpoint security tools by deploying at least one secure enterprise browser.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter Island, which launched its Chromium-based Enterprise Browser in 2022. The browser is designed to provide a safe workspace for users as they access SaaS and other web apps, with its built-in safe browsing, web filtering, web isolation, exploit prevention, and zero-trust network access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Dallas-based company, founded by industry veterans Mike Fey and Dan Amiga, has raised $730M and is valued at $4.8B. Island says it has more than 450 enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-mimic"&gt;6. Mimic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware defense&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto-based Mimic was founded in 2023 by Derek Smith, former CEO of Shape Security. Mimic bills itself as the last line of defense against ransomware with its kernel-level approach to detecting and deflecting attacks. The company also provides a rapid recovery feature that helps organizations spin up critical assets that “mimic” the enterprise’s original data stores so they can avoid paying a ransom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mimic’s ability to detect and deflect ransomware so much faster than traditional defenses is unique in the market,” says Google Ventures General Partner &lt;a href="https://www.gv.com/team/karim-faris"&gt;Karim Faris&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe Mimic’s capabilities, combined with their use of AI, will become part of every CISO’s minimum required defense strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimic recently announced the launch of Mimic Signal Generator, a new capability that enables customers to simulate the impact of ransomware attacks in a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-noma-security"&gt;7. Noma Security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; AI security/AI agent security&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognized by Gartner as a “Cool Vendor” in AI security, Noma provides an AI and agent security and governance platform that includes discovery for AI asset and agent attack surfaces, AI security posture management and risk prioritization, runtime controls for blocking malicious prompts and destructive agent actions; automated AI red teaming and compliance support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://evolutionequity.com/team/richard-seewald/"&gt;Richard Seewald&lt;/a&gt;, Evolution Equity Partners founder, said, “We chose to invest in Noma Security based on two main factors. First, the Noma Security founding team had the foresight to build a comprehensive AI security and governance platform to address all CISO challenges related to AI security. Second, as evidenced by rapid customer growth, Noma Security quickly found product-market fit within the enterprise CISO’s organization with a solution for agentic AI security and governance.” Noma was founded in 2023 and has already raised $135M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-reality-defender"&gt;8. Reality Defender&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Deepfake detection&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Reality Defender was selected as a winner in the 2024 SINET16 Innovator Awards and was named the most innovative company at the 2024 RSA Innovation Sandbox. Founded in 2021 by Ben Colman, Reality Defender is a detection platform designed to spot deepfakes across audio, video, images, and text. Investors include Booz Allen Ventures, IBM Ventures, Accenture, DCVC, and Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reality Defender trains its algorithms on massive datasets of both authentic and generated media. This enables it to “analyze pixel-level traces in video and frequency patterns in audio to find signals invisible to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Reality Defender has swiftly established itself as the industry leader in deepfake detection,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dcvc.com/team/ali-tamaseb/"&gt;Ali Tamaseb&lt;/a&gt;, a general partner at DCVC&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; “It offers vitally needed protection against emerging digital threats against enterprises, governments, and the world’s largest banks and financial institutions.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-upwind"&gt;9. Upwind&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:  &lt;/strong&gt;Cloud native application protection platform (CNAAP)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; San Francisco-based Upwind has raised $180M, reported 4,000% year-over-year revenue growth in 2024, 40% customer expansion, and more than 30 product updates. Upwind is challenging &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573629/cnapp-buyers-guide-top-tools-compared.html"&gt;legacy CNAPP vendors&lt;/a&gt; with a runtime-first detection and protection platform that covers every layer of the cloud stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upwind’s unified CNAPP platform integrates &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/657138/how-to-choose-the-best-cloud-security-posture-management-tools.html"&gt;cloud security posture management (CSPM)&lt;/a&gt;, cloud workload protection, cloud detection and response, vulnerability management, and identity security, and grounds it in live runtime activity. Customers report up to 95% fewer alerts and faster time-to-remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, there were reports that Datadog was in talks to buy Upwind; however, no acquisition has taken place. Upwind was founded in 2022 by Amiram Shachar, who founded Spot, a &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/189652/top-13-cloud-cost-management-tools.html"&gt;cloud cost optimization platform&lt;/a&gt;, and sold it to NetApp for $450M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-zenity"&gt;10. Zenity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; AI trust, risk, and security management (AITRiSM)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Zenity was selected as the “Agentic AI Security Solution of the Year” by the &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zenity-named-agentic-ai-security-140300911.html"&gt;CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards&lt;/a&gt; program, and was also cited as a “Cool Vendor” by Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zenity offers a comprehensive platform that governs how AI agents are built, what they can access, and what they can do, in real-time. The platform includes discovery of all agents across SaaS, cloud, and endpoints; governance in the form of applying policies; and continuous monitoring of agent behavior to detect malicious intent. The company, founded by Ben Kliger, a former Microsoft employee, has raised $38M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/global-experts-advance-joint-fight-against-crypto-enabled-crime</link>
      <description>The criminal use of cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly professionalised, but so too is the global response. Participants at the 9th Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptoassets emphasised three priorities: developing common standards, deepening cooperation and investing in capacity. These are essential if authorities and industry are to keep pace with evolving threats and recover illicit cryptoassets at scale.</description>

&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Louvre Museum broken window burglary" class="wp-image-4084014" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Louvre_Museum_broken_window_burglary_shutterstock_2692082701.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Windows-Sicherheitsprobleme haben beim Louvre-Museum scheinbar Tradition.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a class="imageCredit" href="https://enterprise.shutterstock.com/image-photo/paris-october-19-2025-french-police-2692082701" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterstock / Phil Pasquini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Louvre-Museum in Paris wurde im Oktober 2025 bekanntlich von Einbrechern heimgesucht und auf &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/louvre-thieves-slow-motion-getaway-caught-on-video" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ziemlich dreiste Art und Weise&lt;/a&gt; um Juwelen im Wert von circa 88 Millionen Euro erleichtert. Die Diebe nutzten für ihren Raubzug einen Möbelaufzug (&lt;a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/regional/nordrheinwestfalen/wdr-moebelaufzug-von-juwelen-raub-kommt-aus-werne-firma-wirbt-damit-100.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made in Germany&lt;/a&gt;), um durch ein Fenster im zweiten Stock des Louvre einzusteigen und die historischen Schmuckstücke aus ihren Vitrinen zu stehlen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sowohl die Alarmsysteme am betroffenen Fenster als auch an den Vitrinen haben dabei laut &lt;a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/presse/communiques-de-presse/informations-relatives-au-vol-par-effraction-survenu-ce-dimanche-19-octobre-au-musee-du-louvre" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dem französischen Kulturministerium&lt;/a&gt; wie vorgesehen funktioniert. Der Einbruch führte zu einer umfassenden Überprüfung der Sicherheitsvorkehrungen des Louvre. In einer &lt;a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/presse/communiques-de-presse/enquete-administrative-confiee-a-l-igac-a-la-suite-du-vol-survenu-au-musee-du-louvre-premieres-conclusions-et-mesures-d-urgence" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ersten Reaktion&lt;/a&gt; empfahl die französische Behörde für kulturelle Angelegenheiten kürzlich:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neue Governance-Regeln und Security-Richtlinien einzuführen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;zusätzliche Sicherheitskameras rund um den Gebäude-Perimeter zu installieren, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;sämtliche Sicherheitsprotokolle und -prozesse bis Jahresende zu aktualisieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist laut einem &lt;a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/louvre-en-mot-de-passe-logiciels-obsoletes-mises-a-jour-impossibles-dix-ans-de-failles-dans-la-securite-informatique-du-premier-musee-au-monde-20251101_RD5YGV6WMVAXLL6U3SRGVFBIBY/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aktuellen Bericht&lt;/a&gt; der französischen Tageszeitung Libération auch dringend nötig – nicht nur mit Blick auf den Millionenraub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="wer-braucht-schon-updates"&gt;“Wer braucht schon Updates?”&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denn die Journalisten von Libération konnten diverse vertrauliche &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492356/security-standard-wie-sie-sich-auf-ein-soc-2-audit-vorbereiten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Audits&lt;/a&gt; der Sicherheitssysteme des Louvre-Museums einsehen. Demnach gab es bereits 2014 und 2017 eklatante IT-Sicherheitsprobleme. So sei bei einem Audit durch die französische Cybersicherheitsbehörde ANSSI im Jahr 2014 festgestellt worden, dass das Office-Automation-Netzwerk des Louvre auf Windows 2000 lief – drei Jahre nachdem Microsoft die Security-Updates für sein Legacy-Betriebssystem eingestellt hatte. Ein weiteres haarsträubendes Highlight des Berichts: Ein Videoüberwachungssystem, dessen Server mit Passwort LOUVRE “abgesichert” war. Laut dem Bericht von Libération wurde den Louvre-Verantwortlichen damals seitens ANSSI empfohlen, komplexe &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492356/security-standard-wie-sie-sich-auf-ein-soc-2-audit-vorbereiten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Passwörter&lt;/a&gt; einzusetzen, Schwachstellen zu patchen und seine Software zu aktualisieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dass man diesen Empfehlungen offenbar nicht nachgekommen ist, zeigt der zweite Audit-Report aus dem Jahr 2017 – diesmal durchgeführt von der dem französischen Innenministerium unterstellten Behörde &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_national_des_hautes_%C3%A9tudes_de_la_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_et_de_la_justice" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;INHESJ&lt;/a&gt;. Diese Prüfer stellten laut Libération drei Jahre später ebenfalls fest, dass Arbeitsplätze mit veralteten Betriebssystemen wie Windows 2000 und XP (Support seitens Microsoft 2014 eingestellt) ausgestattet waren und beanstandeten eine laxe Passworthygiene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Und die Windows-Probleme des Louvre setzten sich auch danach weiter fort – mindestens bis zum Jahr 2021. So wurde etwa ein Videoüberwachungssystem des französischen Unternehmens Thales im Jahr 2003 eingeführt. Dokumenten zufolge lief dieses bis zum Jahr 2021 auf einem Rechner mit Windows Server 2003 (erweiterter Support 2015 ausgelaufen) – obwohl die Applikation schon seit 2019 keinen Support und damit auch keine Sicherheits-Updates mehr erhielt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es gibt zwar keine Anzeichen dafür, dass die langjährigen Softwareprobleme des Louvre mit dem Millionenraub aus dem Oktober 2025 in Zusammenhang stehen. Dennoch lassen die nun bekannt gewordenen Umstände erkennen, dass die Verantwortlichen des Museums wohl nicht nur die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493920/10-essenzielle-masnahmen-fur-physische-sicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;physische Security&lt;/a&gt; vernachlässigt haben.

      <title>Fake number, real damage: Europol urges action against caller ID spoofing</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/fake-number-real-damage-europol-urges-action-against-caller-id-spoofing</link>
      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <title>Office sandbox file security to disappear from enterprise Windows by late 2027, Microsoft confirms</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085172/office-sandbox-file-security-to-disappear-from-enterprise-windows-by-late-2027-microsoft-confirms-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windows enterprise administrators will have until December 2027 at the latest to put in place alternatives to the security protection offered by Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG) for Office, the company has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MDAG’s purpose is to protect customers from the threat of boobytrapped Office documents sent via email. The feature was added to some Office subscription tiers from 2019 onwards, but Microsoft announced in &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;November 2023&lt;/a&gt; that the feature was nearing the end of the road, since when customers have been waiting for more detail on how and when this would happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1182696" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s new timeline&lt;/a&gt; on its customer portal, removal will begin with Office version 2602 for the Current Patch Tuesday Channel in February 2026, the Monthly Enterprise Channel in April 2026, and the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel in July 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Full removal will happen for Office version 2612 by December 2026 for the Current Channel, February 2027 for the Monthly Enterprise Channel, and July 2027 for the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ambiguously, the timeline also lists December 2027 as the final date for removal, although it’s likely that the later date is a final cut-off for customers with extended support licenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="isolation-overhead"&gt;Isolation overhead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of opening files in main memory, MDAG opens files in a Hyper-V sandbox, thereby isolating any malware executed from the operating system. The concept is sound, but it comes with the inconvenience of much slower document load times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It could also be undermined by occasional vulnerabilities in the isolation layer, an example of which would be &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26706" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2022-26706&lt;/a&gt;, a sandbox escape flaw &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/13/uncovering-a-macos-app-sandbox-escape-vulnerability-a-deep-dive-into-cve-2022-26706/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;affecting macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is replacing MDAG with two security layers it claims do the same job: &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)&lt;/a&gt; rules and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/wdac" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ASR is a rules-based mechanism for blocking malicious scripts, executables, or code injection. While the performance is much improved, one potential downside is that it relies on behavioral analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens if attackers use a novel technique not yet picked up by ASR? Microsoft’s view is that they rarely do because most malicious document attacks exploit predictable techniques. Backed by cloud-based machine learning, the chances of an innovative attack getting past ASR are claimed to be small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, WDAC analysis, which executes at kernel level, blocks applications by monitoring digital signatures, file hashes, and other reputation signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="admin-workload"&gt;Admin workload&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that the removal process happens automatically, what’s left for administrators to do?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although many enterprise IT teams are probably not hugely aware of MDAG, there could still be hidden work caused by its removal. Microsoft, for its part, recommends that administrators do the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ASR&lt;/a&gt; rules to block risky Office file behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/wdac" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)&lt;/a&gt; to ensure only trusted, signed code runs on devices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Review internal documentation and helpdesk guidance if your organization previously relied on Application Guard for Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, MDAG’s deprecation could still cause problems for customers that have built it into automated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A generic example of this would be an automated workflow script that will only allow an Office document to be opened once it has passed through MDAG. If MDAG is no longer present, that script will need to be re-written — and procedures changed if the logs from isolation security testing were being sent into SIEMs as part of compliance rules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although primarily affecting organizations with a cautious approach to Office documents such as critical infrastructure or government, this re-scripting could still turn into a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s not in doubt is the stress induced by the regular churn of new and deprecated features on a Windows platform that has gradually become byzantine in its complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, Computerworld has published a &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1682225/windows-10-a-guide-to-the-updates.html"&gt;regularly updated guide to Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; and 11 components and features as they appear, or disappear. Meanwhile, the arrival of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3996290/securing-windows-11-and-server-2025-what-cisos-should-know-about-the-latest-updates.html"&gt;Windows 11 has introduced&lt;/a&gt; several changes to the operating system’s underlying security architecture, many built around &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2121652/microsoft-amps-up-focus-on-windows-11-security-to-address-evolving-cyberthreats.html"&gt;Security Copilot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cisco fixes critical flaws in Unified Contact Center Express</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086396/cisco-fixes-critical-flaws-in-unified-contact-center-express.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco released patches for two critical vulnerabilities in its Unified Contact Center Express (CCX) that could allow attackers to bypass authentication and execute commands as root on the underlying system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company also warned today about a new attack variation targeting two previously patched vulnerabilities in its Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) software. The flaws were exploited in the wild by a cyberespionage group tracked as UAT4356 or Storm-1849.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two vulnerabilities in Unified CCX impact version 15.0, as well as versions 12.5 SU3 and earlier, regardless of configuration. The company released versions 15.0 ES01 and 12.5 SU3 ES07 to address these flaws and urged customers to install them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco Unified CCX is a contact center solution for midsize businesses with up to 400 agents. It performs automated call routing and interactive voice response, and it enables agents to interact with customers through multiple channels, including voice, web chat, email, and social media through a unified desktop client.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="authentication-bypass-and-remote-code-execution"&gt;Authentication bypass and remote code execution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the flaws, tracked as CVE-2025-20354, is located in the Editor application and allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain the ability to create and execute scripts with administrative privileges. This vulnerability received a CVSS rating of 9.4 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This vulnerability is due to improper authentication mechanisms in the communication between the CCX Editor and an affected Unified CCX server,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cc-unauth-rce-QeN8h7mQ"&gt;its advisory&lt;/a&gt;. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by redirecting the authentication flow to a malicious server and tricking the CCX Editor into believing the authentication was successful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-20354, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to upload a specially crafted file to a vulnerable Cisco Unified CCX server through the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) process. This attack could result in the execution of commands on the underlying OS with root privileges. The CVSS severity rating for this flaw is 9.8.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Cisco is not aware of any malicious exploitation of these flaws, users should deploy the patches as soon as possible as these are the type of flaws that attackers tend to adopt very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has &lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cc-mult-vuln-gK4TFXSn"&gt;also patched four medium severity flaws&lt;/a&gt; in Unified CCX, Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise (CCE), Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (CCE) and Cisco Unified Intelligence Center (UIC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracked as CVE-2025-20374, CVE-2025-20375, CVE-2025-20376, and CVE-2025-20377, these flaws can lead to sensitive information disclosure, arbitrary file download, arbitrary command execution, and privilege escalation to root. However, to be exploited, they require authentication as a valid user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-attack-variant-for-asa-and-ftd"&gt;New attack variant for ASA and FTD&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Separately, Cisco warned that hackers have developed a new attack variant for &lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-webvpn-z5xP8EUB"&gt;CVE-2025-20333&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-webvpn-YROOTUW"&gt;CVE-2025-20362&lt;/a&gt;, two actively exploited flaws in Cisco ASA and FTD originally patched in September. While the flaws were initially exploited for unauthorized access to VPN endpoints and remote code execution, the new attack variation can only lead to unexpected device reboots and denial-of-service conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Russian APT abuses Windows Hyper-V for persistence and malware execution</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085272/russian-apt-abuses-windows-hyper-v-for-persistence-and-malware-execution.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberespionage groups are always looking for novel ways to establish covert and long-term persistent access to compromised systems. The latest example comes from a Russian APT group known as Curly COMrades, which deploys Linux-based virtual machines on compromised Windows 10 machines to hide their malware tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The attackers enabled the Hyper-V role on selected victim systems to deploy a minimalistic, Alpine Linux-based virtual machine,” researchers from Bitdefender wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-gb/blog/businessinsights/curly-comrades-evasion-persistence-hidden-hyper-v-virtual-machines"&gt;a report on Curly COMrades’ activity&lt;/a&gt;. “This hidden environment, with its lightweight footprint (only 120MB disk space and 256MB memory), hosted their custom reverse shell, CurlyShell, and a reverse proxy, CurlCat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V is a bare-metal hypervisor included in Windows 10 and 11 Pro and Enterprise editions, as well as Windows Server. When the feature is enabled, users can create virtual machines with different operating systems that run on the same hardware as the Windows host.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Curly COMrades is a Russia-aligned APT group first documented by Bitdefender in August after &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4039318/russian-apt-group-curly-comrades-employs-novel-backdoor-and-persistence-tricks.html"&gt;it targeted key government and judicial organizations from EU-hopefuls Moldova and Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The name comes from the group’s heavy usage of the curl.exe tool and its hijacking of Component Object Model (COM) objects for persistence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group is known for other novel techniques, such as inserting malware into the CLSID and COM handler associated with a Windows scheduled task that is enabled and executed by the system periodically when .NET applications are installed or updated. The obscure scheduled task corresponds to a Microsoft tool called NGEN (Native Image Generator).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group’s Hyper-V abuse came to light after Bitdefender researchers continued their forensic investigation of the group’s activities and compromises with the help of the Georgian government’s CERT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By isolating the malware and its execution environment within a VM, the attackers effectively bypassed many traditional host-based EDR detections,” the researchers concluded. “EDR needs to be complemented by host-based network inspection to detect C2 traffic escaping the VM, and proactive hardening tools to restrict the initial abuse of native system binaries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enabling-hyper-v-covertly"&gt;Enabling Hyper-V covertly&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Logs extracted from a compromised system revealed that the attackers first used the Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command-line tool to enable the Hyper-V hypervisor itself, while also disabling its graphical management interface, Hyper-V Manager.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group then downloaded a RAR archive masquerading as an MP4 video file and extracted its contents. The archive contained two VHDX (virtual hard disk) and VMCX (virtual machine configuration) files corresponding to a pre-built Alpine Linux VM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers then used the Import-VM and Start-VM PowerShell cmdlets to import the virtual machine into Hyper-V and start it with the name WSL — a deception tactic given that WSL on Windows stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, another feature that allows running Linux containers under the Windows kernel. More popular than Hyper-V for virtualization on Windows, WSL is widely used by developers, making its presence less likely to receive scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Alpine Linux VM is very small and hosts only two custom implants that Bitdefender has dubbed CurlyShell and CurlCat. They are both built using libcurl, an open-source network transfer library that supports a large variety of protocols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CurlyShell uses libcurl to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server and set up a reverse shell, meaning it listens for commands issued by the server, passes them to the Linux command line, and returns the output. Meanwhile, CurlCat acts as a proxy for tunneling SSH traffic as HTTP requests, making that traffic harder to detect by network monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-malware-tools"&gt;Other malware tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found additional malware payloads left by the attackers on systems, including a custom PowerShell script used to inject a Kerberos ticket into LSASS to enable authentication and command execution on remote systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another PowerShell script was pushed to multiple systems via domain Group Policy to change the password of an account called user or to create it if it didn’t exist. A variant of this script targeted an account called camera instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of the Georgian CERT who seized one of the group’s C2 servers, the researchers were also able to analyze how attackers had set up their infrastructure, which proved equally sophisticated. The attackers had disabled certificate revocation in CurlCat, which allowed them to deploy custom certificates on their C2 server and still use encrypted HTTPS traffic. A proxy server listening to incoming traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) then decrypted and relayed that traffic to an SSH server with a custom configuration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sophistication demonstrated by Curly COMrades confirms a key trend: as EDR/XDR solutions become commodity tools, threat actors are getting better at bypassing them through tooling or techniques like VM isolation,” the researchers said. “To counter this, organizations must move beyond relying on a single security layer and implement defense-in-depth, multilayered security. It is critical to start designing the entire environment to be hostile to attackers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bitdefender &lt;a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/malware-ioc/blob/master/2025_11_04-curlycomrades-iocs.csv"&gt;published indicators of compromise&lt;/a&gt; related to this attack campaign on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Operation Chargeback: 4.3 million cardholders affected, EUR 300 million in damages</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-chargeback-43-million-cardholders-affected-eur-300-million-in-damages</link>
      <description>On 4 November 2025, an international coordinated action day targeted three major fraud and money laundering networks as part of Operation “Chargeback.” Led by the Cybercrime Department (Landeszentralstelle Cybercrime) of the General Prosecutor's Office (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) in Koblenz, Germany, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the operation has been investigating these networks since December 2020. More than 60 house searches were conducted and a total of 18 arrest warrants executed. The criminal networks are suspected of misusing credit card data from over 4.3 million cardholders across 193 countries. In total, the estimated damage from the fraud scheme exceeds EUR 300 million, with attempted damages amounting to over EUR 750 million.</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

      <title>9 top bug bounty programs launched in 2025</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/657751/top-bug-bounty-programs.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/560279/why-you-need-a-bug-bounty-program.html"&gt;Bug bounty programs&lt;/a&gt; remain a crucial component of cybersecurity strategies in 2025, offering organizations the ability to draw in help from a diverse pool of cybersecurity professionals and researchers. The schemes offer continuous testing against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are bug bounty programs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bug bounty programs are structured systems for individuals to identify and report &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619312/software-bugs-that-bug-me-and-how-to-swat-them-down.html"&gt;security vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; and other bugs. They are offered by organizations, websites, and software developers. These programs are designed to leverage the skills of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/644922/hackrate-releases-ethical-hacking-monitoring-platform-hackgate.html"&gt;ethical hackers&lt;/a&gt; to enhance the security of software and systems before malicious parties can exploit these vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants, often referred to as bug bounty hunters, earn financial rewards or other forms of recognition for successfully reporting vulnerabilities in assets covered by bug bounty programs. Exploits achieved through social engineering trickery such as phishing are typically excluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bug bounty programs focus in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For ethical hackers, best practice for bug bounty hunting in 2025 involves thorough reconnaissance of a target organization’s technology stack, rather than just running automated tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leading bug bounty platforms such as Bugcrowd, HackerOne, Synack, YesWeHack, and Intigriti offer rewards for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities. Platforms connect ethical hackers with organizations, providing a structured framework for vulnerability disclosure and resolution — managing bug bounty rewards on behalf of their corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology providers and government organizations run stand-alone bug bounty programs as part of a broader security testing strategy that also includes penetration tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months bug bounties have begun offering increased payouts and broader scope. Traditional web and mobile categories are being supplemented by an &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082265/ai-powered-bug-hunting-shakes-up-bounty-industry-for-better-or-worse.html"&gt;increased focus on AI systems&lt;/a&gt; and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the past year, Accenture has seen bug bounty go AI-assisted at scale: Researchers lean on AI, programs incorporate AI systems in bounty scope, and prompt-injection findings have surged,” Ryan Whelan, Accenture global cyber intelligence lead, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vendors now pay for full exploit chains, not one-off bugs,” Whelan says, adding that this shows how the bug bounty market has matured to reward researchers for vulnerabilities that have “real-world impact and reproducibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the notable programs launched or expanded in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="apple-increases-rewards-and-expands-bounty-program"&gt;Apple increases rewards and expands bounty program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071044/apple-bumps-rce-bug-bounties-to-2m-to-counter-commercial-spyware-vendors.html"&gt;Apple doubled the maximum reward for zero-click iPhone remote exploits&lt;/a&gt; from $1 million to $2 million, with additional bonuses for uncovering complex exploit chains pushing potential payouts up to $5 million or more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apple also significantly increased rewards in other categories to encourage more intensive research. This includes $100,000 for a complete macOS Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vendor also added WebKit browser and wireless proximity exploits into the scope of its revamped Apple Security Bounty program. The most severe One-click WebKit sandbox escapes can earn up to $300,000. Payouts of up $1 million are payable for wireless proximity exploits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The updates — which come into effect in November 2025 — are in response to a febrile threat environment, exemplified by sophisticated exploit chains historically associated with state actors that are being harnessed by spyware vendors in targeted attacks, &lt;a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/"&gt;Apple warns in a blog post on its revamped program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-launches-dedicated-ai-related-bug-bounty-program"&gt;Google launches dedicated AI-related bug bounty program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6116887259840512/announcing-google-s-new-ai-vulnerability-reward-program"&gt;Google launched a dedicated AI Vulnerability Reward Program in October 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The scheme aims to incentivize security researchers to focus on uncovering previously undiscovered flaws in the vendor’s AI-based product and services, such as Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eligible exploits include those that lead to unauthorized account or data modifications, data exfiltration, model theft, or phishing enablement. Rewards operate in tiers from $5,000 up to $30,000. Prompt injections or jailbreaks are out of scope and not eligible for any rewards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tech giant also increased the rewards offered through its core bug bounty program, increasing the highest category rewards for researchers who discover flaws in Google Chrome to $250,000. Expanded categories and higher rewards pushed the total amount paid out by &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/03/vulnerability-reward-program-2024-in.html"&gt;Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program&lt;/a&gt; to $12 million throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-continues-zero-day-quest"&gt;Microsoft continues Zero Day Quest&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-ai"&gt;Microsoft expanded its AI Copilot bug bounty&lt;/a&gt;, with rewards up to $30,000 for code injection and other severe vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technology giant also announced plans for its largest hacking event, “&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/08/zero-day-quest-join-the-largest-hacking-event-with-up-to-5-million-in-total-bounty-awards/"&gt;Zero Day Quest&lt;/a&gt;,” due to take place in spring 2026 and focused on uncovering cloud and AI vulnerabilities in products such as Microsoft Azure, Copilot, Identity, and M365.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next year’s event follows the successful conclusion of an inaugural event in April, which focused on high impact vulnerabilities in Copilot and cloud and led to payouts of more than $1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/08/microsoft-bounty-program-year-in-review-17-million-in-rewards"&gt;Microsoft paid out a total of $17 million&lt;/a&gt; to 344 security researchers this year, the company announced in August.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="samsung-puts-a-premium-on-mobile-security"&gt;Samsung puts a premium on mobile security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/rewardsProgram.smsb"&gt;Samsung launched a new bug bounty for mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;, offering up to $1 million for ethical hackers who discover and report critical flaws in core mobile systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highest awards are on offer for high-impact bugs that present an arbitrary code execution risk on highly privileged targets or that bypass in-built security protections such as the Knox Vault or the TEEGRIS OS security platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The program covers vulnerabilities in Samsung’s smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, personal computers, services, and applications. Potential rewards vary depending on product as well as the severity of uncovered flaws.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="anthropic-offers-rewards-for-jailbreaking-claude"&gt;Anthropic offers rewards for jailbreaking Claude&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/testing-our-safety-defenses-with-a-new-bug-bounty-program"&gt;Anthropic launched a new bug bounty initiative&lt;/a&gt;, run through HackerOne, to stress-test advanced safety classifiers protecting Claude models. The invite-only trial program offered rewards of up to $25,0000 for vulnerabilities that reliably bypass AI safety constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scheme ran for a few weeks before it was replaced by a &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/policy_scopes"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; focused on stress-testing &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-classifiers"&gt;Constitutional Classifiers system&lt;/a&gt; on the new Claude Opus 4 model. In August the scheme was further refined to offer &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-safety-bug-bounty"&gt;rewards of up to $15,000 to pre-invited researchers who identify AI safety mitigation shortcomings&lt;/a&gt; in early pre-release versions of Anthropic’s Claude AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="openai-levels-up-bug-bounty-reward-program"&gt;OpenAI levels up bug bounty reward program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://opentools.ai/news/openai-cranks-up-bug-bounty-rewards-to-dollar100k-why-its-a-winning-move-for-ai-security"&gt;OpenAI dramatically increased the potential payouts for those who discovered critical vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; in its AI models and infrastructure from $20,000 to $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assets that are in scope include ChatGPT, Open AI’s APIs, Open API corporate information and website, as explained in much more depth in &lt;a href="https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/openai"&gt;Open AI’s program page on Bugcrowd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nvidia-scales-up-security-defenses"&gt;Nvidia scales up security defenses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chip giant &lt;a href="https://www.intigriti.com/blog/business-insights/intigriti-teams-with-nvidia-to-launch-bug-bounty-vulnerability-disclosure-program"&gt;Nvidia has teamed up with bug bounty platform Intigriti&lt;/a&gt; to launch a bug bounty and no financial reward vulnerability disclosure program (VDP), which is due to go live early in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nvidia products will be covered by a private bug bounty program. An additional private bug bounty package will cover core AI assets. The VDP extends to all other Nvidia assets, such as its website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="shields-up"&gt;Shields up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Belgian higher eduction and healthcare tech provider &lt;a href="https://www.intigriti.com/blog/news/intigriti-partners-with-shield-to-empower-security-within-healthcare"&gt;Shield has partnered with Intigriti to launch a vulnerability disclosure program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[The] partnership provides essential support and services on vulnerability disclosure programs for critical national infrastructure (CNI) organizations such as hospitals, that now need to comply with NIS2 [EU cybersecurity regulation],” Intigriti said in a statement about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last December virtual assets platform &lt;a href="https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/cryptocom-launches-landmark-usd-2-million-bug-bounty-program-hackerone"&gt;Crypto.com upgraded its existing bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/crypto?type=team"&gt;HackerOne&lt;/a&gt;, providing up to $2 million in rewards for the reporting of critical security vulnerabilities. The boost made the vendor’s technology the most lucrative target for bug bounty hunters before recent enhancement to Apple’s program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[For a look at last year’s top announcements, see “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085288"&gt;12 notable bug bounty programs launched in 2024&lt;/a&gt;.”]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cybercrime-as-a-service takedown: 7 arrested</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros.

      <title>What past ERP mishaps can teach CISOs about security platformization</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080709/what-past-erp-mishaps-can-teach-cisos-about-security-platformization.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research studies indicate that the average enterprise has between 40 and 80 separate security tools, a broad inventory that often leads to multiple security data silos, integration challenges, constant maintenance and tuning, and alert fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the challenges of this situation and the potential market for unified solutions, cybersecurity technology vendors like Cisco, CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, and Trend Micro have been cobbling together security technology “platforms” —integrated product bundles that aggregate areas such as cloud security, email security, endpoint security, network security, SIEM, threat intelligence, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Moving from independent tools to an integrated architecture with a centralized database acting as the single point of truth. Where have we heard this before?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="erp-migrations-set-the-stage-for-platform-challenges"&gt;ERP migrations set the stage for platform challenges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We older technologists may remember a similar migration to &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/272362/what-is-erp-key-features-of-top-enterprise-resource-planning-systems.html"&gt;enterprise resource planning (ERP)&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, large organizations had independent departmental applications in areas such as finance, inventory management, supply chain management, HR, and manufacturing, resulting in disparate processes, separate teams, and no centralized view of the business.  ERP systems promised a “central nervous system” for the business, aggregating departmental data into a single, shared database and providing a unified, real-time view of the company’s operations. Driven by Y2K, enterprises raced toward ERP nirvana throughout the decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alas, it wasn’t so easy. ERP migrations were fraught with challenges like incompatible data formats requiring massive ETL and data transformation efforts. Many firms faced long and arduous efforts to customize ERP for their industry and organizational needs. Some organizations &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/284312/10-common-erp-mistakes-to-avoid.html"&gt;botched project planning&lt;/a&gt; leading to lengthy implementations and cost overruns. And in their focus on a hasty technology transition, many firms forgot to execute necessary &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/272222/change-management-change-management-definition-and-solutions.html"&gt;organizational changes&lt;/a&gt; like gaining employee buy-in, modifying processes, and training technicians. This led to political strife and even outright project sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there’s no Y2K-like sword of Damocles hanging over CISOs’ heads, many security executives are considering security platforms for security efficacy, operational efficiency, and/or financial rationalization. Those still sitting on the fence are frequently persuaded by CFOs to at least consider this option. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-tips-for-getting-security-platformization-right"&gt;5 tips for getting security platformization right&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current trending suggests that in many enterprises, security platform migration is inevitable in the short- or long-term. Given this, CISOs would be well served by carefully studying the mistakes made with ERP and plan accordingly with proven best practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on my research, here are a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get executive buy-in and vocal leadership.&lt;/strong&gt; Successful ERP migrations were driven by clearly defined business goals and passionate executive teams. Similarly, security platform migration should go beyond limited security and/or financial benefits alone. CISOs should prepare a business case demonstrating how a security platform will improve business-critical system protection and deliver cyber resilience to the organization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the board of directors and executives are committed, they should oversee project implementation objectives, provide organizational and employee incentives for meeting success metrics, and visibly cheerlead the effort. For their part, CISOs should continually communicate project progress in business — not just technical — terms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus first on the security team, not the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; ERP migrations were often impaired by doubtful IT employees myopically focused on their pet technologies or limited responsibilities. Correspondingly, some security professionals will be reluctant to give up their favored tools (i.e., “server huggers”) and individual tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs must win over these naysayers by refocusing them on the overall mission of protecting the organization, and then carefully educate them on how a security platform aligns with this objective. Make sure to support the team with the services and training they’ll need for a successful technology transition and offer team and individual incentives to do so. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs would also be wise to think about folding career development opportunities into their security platform planning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for project phases, not ‘big bang’ implementations.&lt;/strong&gt; ERP implementation challenges were often associated with overly aggressive project timelines. This led to project delays, cost overruns, and ultimately business impact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one famous example, &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/284312/10-common-erp-mistakes-to-avoid.html"&gt;Hershey’s had an ERP-related system outage&lt;/a&gt; during the Halloween season and couldn’t ship products to its distributors. This led to lost market share, quarterly revenue impact, and a decrease in its share price. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To deliver value through a phased approach, organizations should start with a dependency map to understand &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;all the idiosyncrasies and connections of the existing architecture&lt;/a&gt;.  Clearly map out the future state, including data and workflows, and use this to determine how and where to start replacing tools. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Build an overlay implementation that mirrors the existing infrastructure. Create a test and rollback plan. Determine technical and business metrics — and executive reports — for each phase of the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should follow the adage and consider patience a virtue throughout the project. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start the technology journey with a modern data pipeline.&lt;/strong&gt; Once IT teams rolled up their sleeves toward ERP projects, they discovered data inconsistency everywhere. Finance systems referred to a major supplier as Acme Inc., CRM systems used ACME Incorporated, and each system used different customer numbers and billing addresses. This led to lengthy ETL processes to gain data reliability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should overcome similar issues by focusing on data pipelining for achieving data quality, consistency, and accessibility. This will help break down data silos and build a single source of cybersecurity truth. A scalable data pipeline will ultimately accelerate the delivery of trustworthy data for analytics and decision-making. Again, this will deliver security &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; business benefits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the transition for process re-engineering.&lt;/strong&gt; Too often, organizations tried to force fit existing business and technology processes into new ERP systems, leading to complex customization and political dissent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To avoid a similar fate, CISOs should use platformization as an opportunity to modernize and automate inefficient and/or manual processes using baked-in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567745/soapa-vs-soar-how-these-security-terms-differ.html"&gt;security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)&lt;/a&gt; and AI functionality. Make sure to find ways for removing security bottlenecks to business processes, such as onboarding new users or providing timely reports to business managers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, CISOs should make process re-engineering part of the planning, testing, and implementation aspects of the project. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="inflection-point-for-cisos"&gt;Inflection point for CISOs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the migration to ERP systems is often cited as an inflection point, when CIOs went from technical administrators to critical business executives. Prudent CISOs may benefit from platformization in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Chinese hackers target Western diplomats using hard-to-patch Windows shortcut flaw</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082701/chinese-hackers-target-western-diplomats-using-hard-to-patch-windows-shortcut-flaw.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chinese hackers have been spotted targeting European diplomats using a longstanding Windows shortcut vulnerability that’s been popular with threat groups as far back as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to security company &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/unc6384-weaponizes-zdi-can-25373-vulnerability-to-deploy-plugx/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arctic Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, whose researchers uncovered the latest campaign, the latest attacks saw spear phishing emails sent to officials working for the governments of Hungary, Belgium, Serbia, Italy, and The Netherlands during September and October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government-operated group suspected of being behind the campaign is named UNC6384 by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). The same group is believed to have targeted diplomats of several Asian countries earlier in 2025, which might give the impression that UNC6384 is a recently discovered threat actor, hence its UNC (“uncategorized”) status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Arctic Wolf said it believed the group’s tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) strongly resemble those of a known Chinese threat group, “Mustang Panda,” which has been around since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, this looks like just another Chinese cyber-espionage campaign against foreign governments. But there is a deeper story: the Windows vulnerability used in the campaign, which Microsoft has so far been unwilling — or unable — to patch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ghost-flaw"&gt;Ghost flaw&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Arctic Wolf, the latest campaign used spear phishing emails with diplomatic themes to lure targets into executing malicious Windows .LNK shortcut files. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Windows UI parsing that allows command-line instructions to be hidden in &lt;a href="https://detection.fyi/sigmahq/sigma/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_susp_lnk_exec_hidden_cmd/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;.LNK format whitespace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows the attackers to launch a sequence of malicious actions while displaying a decoy PDF showing the agenda for a genuine European Commission meeting scheduled to have been held in Brussels on September 26. The result is the deployment of the PlugX remote access Trojan, which has been popular since 2008 as a tool for opening backdoors into Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trend Micro told Microsoft about the weakness in September 2024, after which it was given a &lt;a href="https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9491" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-9491&lt;/a&gt; identifier. However, it turns out that the company’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) had noticed the same issue in 2017, when it was given a separate internal ‘candidate’ identifier, &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ZDI-CAN-25373&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The vulnerability has been exploited by state-sponsored APT groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China,” said Trend Micro in a &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2018 blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite there being a formal CVE, Microsoft appears reluctant to address the issue. As Trend Micro noted in a more recent blog from 2025, “We submitted a proof-of-concept exploit through Trend ZDI’s bug bounty program to Microsoft, who declined to address this vulnerability with a security patch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That reluctance probably stems from the fact that CVE-2025-9491/ZDI-CAN-25373 would be difficult to patch without breaking legacy applications that depend on its current design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On November 1, the day after this article was first published, Microsoft released an &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV25258226" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advisory notice on Windows LNK file UI behavior&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the company reiterated that it does not consider this a vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advisory noted that .lnk files cannot be delivered via browser unless packaged in a .zip file that is then opened by the user. “Attempting to open a .lnk file downloaded from the Internet automatically triggers a security warning advising users not to open files from unknown sources, and we strongly recommend heeding this warning,” Microsoft said in the advisory. “Double-clicking on a .lnk file produces a warning stating that the file format is not trusted; a victim must click through this prompt,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Due to the user interaction involved and the fact that the system already warns users that this format is untrusted, Microsoft does not consider this a vulnerability” it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation"&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a patch, organizations worried about .LNK attacks should consider blocking .LNK files or disabling their execution in Windows Explorer, Arctic Wolf advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This should be put in place across all Windows systems, prioritizing endpoints used by personnel with access to sensitive diplomatic or policy information. While this vulnerability was disclosed in March 2025, adoption by threat actors within months of disclosure necessitates urgent monitoring and countermeasures,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations could also block the command and control (C2) domains used by attackers, although these will change over time. In addition, Arctic Wolf recommends that IT teams search for the presence of Canon printer assistant utilities such as &lt;em&gt;cnmpaui.exe&lt;/em&gt;, which are part of the campaign’s exploit chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “The breadth of targeting across multiple European nations within a condensed timeframe suggests either a large-scale coordinated intelligence collection operation or deployment of multiple parallel operational teams with shared tooling but independent targeting,” Arctic Wolf noted, adding that the fact that UNC6384 had jumped on the flaw so quickly since it was made public earlier in 2025 suggested that the group had access to advanced capabilities and resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not as if attacks exploiting Windows shortcut files in different ways are terribly new or innovative. During 2025, they’ve been abused in different ways by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3987073/after-helping-russia-on-the-ground-north-korea-targets-ukraine-with-cyberespionage.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russian cyber-campaigns&lt;/a&gt; against Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3986671/stealth-rat-uses-a-powershell-loader-for-fileless-attacks.html" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese attacks&lt;/a&gt; using the Remcos RAT, and to target companies in the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3837964/polyglot-files-used-to-spread-new-backdoor.html" target="_blank"&gt;United Arab Emirates (UAE)&lt;/a&gt;. In June the technique was used to hide payloads in attacks abusing the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009636/phishing-campaign-abuses-cloudflare-tunnels-to-sneak-malware-past-firewalls.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloudflare Tunnel service&lt;/a&gt;. The issue is really that this type of flaw, which exploits an otherwise useful feature, is simply difficult to patch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated on November 6 with information about a new advisory notice from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital health can’t scale if cybersecurity falls behind</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085072/digital-health-cant-scale-if-cybersecurity-falls-behind.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the world faced COVID-19, I watched something remarkable happen. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which I had once viewed as tools of research and efficiency, suddenly became instruments of survival. They modelled outbreaks, predicted surges and accelerated vaccine research. Yet at the same time, I witnessed another silent battle unfold a digital one. Health organizations, research institutions and even vaccine supply chains became targets of cyberattacks. For me, it was a turning point that reinforced a simple truth: AI cannot strengthen public health without cybersecurity at its core&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, working at the intersection of data, AI and cloud security for healthcare and life sciences organizations, I’ve seen how transformative intelligent systems can be. But I’ve also seen how fragile they are when trust, data integrity and governance are not built into their foundation. Today, as countries prepare for future pandemics, we must treat cybersecurity not as a support function but as a critical enabler of readiness.  The success of future pandemic preparedness will depend on whether we build trustworthy, secure and ethical AI systems from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-expanding-digital-frontline"&gt;The expanding digital frontline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI-driven pandemic preparedness depends on vast data ecosystems from genomic sequencing labs and hospital networks to connected sensors that monitor population health trends. These systems exchange millions of data points each hour, enabling faster decisions. But every connected device, every model training pipeline and every data integration point expands the attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one of my engagements, public health models were trained using de-identified patient data, IoT feeds and cloud-based analytics. The security challenge was immediate: multiple entry points, distributed teams and differing compliance standards. In such ecosystems, a small misconfiguration an unsecured API or an outdated firmware could expose entire datasets. During the pandemic, these vulnerabilities were exploited at scale. Cybercriminals targeted vaccine research, contact tracing platforms and national health dashboards. It became clear that pandemic preparedness now has a digital dimension as critical as epidemiological preparedness itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-unique-vulnerabilities-of-ai-systems"&gt;The unique vulnerabilities of AI systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional security frameworks are not enough for AI. Attacks on algorithms take subtler forms. I often explain to my clients that when you corrupt data, you corrupt intelligence. Data poisoning occurs when malicious data is inserted into the training process, teaching the AI to make wrong decisions later. Imagine an outbreak prediction model fed with falsified data that underestimates transmission in one region, this could delay interventions and cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another subtle but dangerous threat is model inversion, where attackers reverse-engineer AI outputs to infer private information about patients or study participants. In healthcare, this isn’t just a technical issue, it’s an ethical one. People trust that their health data will never re-identify them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then there are adversarial attacks carefully crafted manipulations that cause AI models to misclassify or ignore patterns. A small perturbation in sensor data could make an outbreak detection algorithm miss early warning signals. These are not theoretical risks, they are realities that cybersecurity teams are already mitigating daily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="designing-trustworthy-ai-ecosystems"&gt;Designing trustworthy AI ecosystems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The systems I help design today for pharmaceutical analytics or public health modeling follow one guiding principle: security by design, not as an afterthought. This begins with a zero-trust architecture assuming every connection, user or system could be compromised until proven otherwise. Role-based access controls, network segmentation and identity verification are now foundational practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also emphasize data provenance, maintaining a traceable chain of custody for every piece of data that enters or leaves a pipeline. This allows us to validate sources, detect tampering and maintain confidence in the insights AI produces. Encryption (both at rest and in transit) is standard, but we also implement differential privacy and homomorphic encryption when dealing with highly sensitive medical or genomic data. These methods allow analysis without exposing personal details an elegant balance between innovation and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model governance is another pillar. Every AI model must have version control, validation sandboxes and rollback capabilities. Before any deployment, we simulate possible adversarial attacks and test recovery procedures. I’ve learned that cybersecurity in AI is not just about defense; it’s about resilience, the ability to detect, isolate and recover without losing functionality during crises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ethics-governance-and-the-elements-of-human-trust"&gt;Ethics, governance and the elements of human trust&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology alone cannot protect public health. Trust is built through ethics and transparency. I often remind data teams that behind every dataset lies a patient, a family or a community. In pandemic situations, public trust determines whether people comply with digital contact tracing, share health information or follow AI-guided advisories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why ethical governance must go hand-in-hand with cybersecurity. AI systems should be explainable, auditable and accountable. Stakeholders from governments to citizens deserve to know how models make decisions, how data is protected and who has access. Regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR and emerging AI governance frameworks are not hurdles; they are guardrails that preserve integrity in moments of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;International cooperation also plays a defining role. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/ehealth/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health&lt;/a&gt; calls for digital solidarity, while the &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST AI Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt; offers a structured approach to assessing and mitigating AI-related risks. Aligning with these standards helps harmonize cybersecurity practices across borders a necessity, since pandemics and cyber threats recognize none.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lessons-from-the-pandemic-era-cybersecurity-as-preparedness"&gt;Lessons from the pandemic era: Cybersecurity as preparedness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 was a wake-up call in more ways than one. Alongside the biological virus, we faced a wave of ransomware, phishing and misinformation attacks that disrupted hospitals and vaccine logistics. I remember reviewing security reports where health data breaches increased by nearly 50% in the early months of 2021. Those of us working on cloud architecture and analytics pipelines suddenly had to think beyond performance, we had to think about resilience under attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experience reshaped my approach to digital health. We now conduct joint drills between epidemiology teams and cybersecurity engineers, simulating not only outbreak scenarios but also cyber incidents. This multidisciplinary collaboration ensures that both biological and digital emergencies are met with preparedness, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts at the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/covid-19-pandemic-teaches-us-about-cybersecurity-cyberattack-cyber-pandemic-risk-virus/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; describe the growing risk of a “cyber pandemic,” where digital contagion spreads faster than any biological one. I share this concern. Our increasing dependence on AI-based systems means a well-coordinated cyberattack could paralyze response operations during an actual health emergency. It is not enough to develop smart systems; we must make them secure and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="moving-forward-the-road-ahead-security-by-intelligence"&gt;Moving forward: The road ahead – security by intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, I believe the next phase of pandemic preparedness must embrace a security-by-intelligence mindset where AI protects itself using AI. Machine learning can detect anomalies, identify suspicious access patterns and predict potential vulnerabilities before exploitation. We are beginning to see cybersecurity evolve from a reactive function into an intelligent, adaptive shield for public health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Training healthcare professionals to recognize phishing attempts, securing endpoint devices and conducting cyber hygiene education must become as routine as infection-control drills. Every clinician, data engineer and policymaker has a role to play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My advice to organizations embarking on digital health transformation is simple: embed cybersecurity from day one. Treat your data pipeline as a clinical asset, it deserves the same rigor as a vaccine trial or a diagnostic protocol. The systems that save lives must be resilient against those who would exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-as-the-true-measure-of-readiness"&gt;Resilience as the true measure of readiness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pandemic preparedness in the age of AI is no longer about who develops the fastest algorithm but who builds the most trustworthy ecosystem. As a data and cybersecurity architect in healthcare, I have witnessed that true innovation lies in resilience systems that continue to protect and perform even when threatened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next global health emergency will test not only our biological defences but also our digital fortifications. To succeed, cybersecurity must evolve from being a compliance checkbox to becoming the moral and operational foundation of digital health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the next outbreak comes and it will, our response must be dual: biological immunity and digital integrity. The AI that protects humanity must never be turned against it. That is the essence of preparedness — and the promise of a safer, smarter and more secure future for global health.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malicious npm packages contain Vidar infostealer</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086415/malicious-npm-packages-contain-vidar-infostealer-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malicious code continues to be uploaded to open source repositories, making it a challenge for responsible developers to trust what’s there, and for CISOs to trust applications that include open source code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest example comes from researchers at Datadog Security, who said that last month they found 17 packages (23 releases) in the &lt;a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/mut-4831-trojanized-npm-packages-vidar/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;npm repository that contained downloader malware&lt;/a&gt; for Windows systems that executes via a postinstall script.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The associated packages masquerade as Telegram bot helper packages, icon libraries, or legitimate-seeming forks of preexisting projects such as Cursor and React. They provide legitimate functionality, but their actual goal is to execute the Vidar infostealer malware on the victim system. Datadog believes this is the first public disclosure of Vidar malware being delivered via npm packages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of the accounts offering these packages (aartje and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;saliii229911 ) have since been banned. However, they were on the registry for about two weeks, and the malicious packages were downloaded at least 2,240 times. However, the researchers believe many of those downloads were likely by automated scrapers, with some occurring after the packages had been removed and replaced with empty security holding packages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="all-sorts-of-nasty-things"&gt;All sorts of nasty things&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malicious compromise of open source components can lead to all sorts of nasty things. First, threat actors can steal developers’ credentials and insert backdoors into their code. Second, the malicious code in the downloaded component itself could spread around the world to the developer’s customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Datadog discovery is just another in a long list of malicious code uploaded to npm, PyPI, GitHub, and other open source repositories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082195/malicious-packages-in-npm-evade-dependency-detection-through-invisible-url-links-report.html" target="_blank"&gt;Last week, Koi Security reported&lt;/a&gt; finding 126 malicious packages in npm, and in September, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4058059/warning-hackers-have-inserted-credential-stealing-code-into-some-npm-libraries.html" target="_blank"&gt;researchers at Step Security reported&lt;/a&gt; that dozens of npm libraries had been replaced with credential stealing code. The same month, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053725/massive-npm-supply-chain-attack-hits-18-popular-packages-with-2b-weekly-downloads.html" target="_blank"&gt;researchers at Aikido reported&lt;/a&gt; that 18 highly popular and highly downloaded npm packages had been contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how to easily solve this problem without requiring a full security view of any newly submitted code, and that’s not fast, cheap, or easy,” commented &lt;a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/roger-grimes-joins-knowbe4-as-data-driven-defense-evangelist" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roger Grimes&lt;/a&gt;, digital defence CISO advisor at KnowBe4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But it really is the only answer if you want reliable, safe, open source code.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ironically, he said, one of the biggest reasons given for the world to use open source code is that it’s readily reviewable, so anyone can look at it to see and stop vulnerabilities. “But the reality is that almost no one security reviews any of the tens of millions of lines of open source code,” he pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There have been dozens of open source projects that attempted to implement more default code review and all have failed,” he said. “One of my favorite related quotes of all time is, ‘Asking for users to review open source code before using is like asking passengers of an airliner to step outside the jet and review it for flight safety before they fly.’ I’m not sure who said that first, but it’s a brilliant summary of why volunteer open source code review really doesn’t work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="typosquatting"&gt;Typosquatting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One favorite tactic of threat actors trying to infect the open source software supply chain is typosquatting, the creation of packages with names similar to those of legitimate ones to trick unwitting developers searching for a particular library. For example, in 2018 a researcher found that &lt;a href="https://bertusk.medium.com/detecting-cyber-attacks-in-the-python-package-index-pypi-61ab2b585c67" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;threat actors had created phony libraries in the Python repository&lt;/a&gt; called ‘diango,’ ‘djago,’ ‘dajngo,’ to dupe developers seeking the popular ‘django’ Python library.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should ensure that employees are educated about the issue of typosquatting and learn what to look for. IT departments should keep a comprehensive inventory of what components are used by all approved software against which audits can be conducted, to ensure only approved components are in place. This inventory and audit should be performed to validate any new components that are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-more-to-do"&gt;What more to do?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of advice for developers and IT and infosec leaders to help them avoid being victimized by malicious packages in open source repositories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One tactic is to include a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573185/what-is-an-sbom-software-bill-of-materials-explained.html" target="_blank"&gt;software bill of materials&lt;/a&gt; in every application an IT department acquires. With it, the DevOps/DevSecOps teams can track software components, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) published an advisory, &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/defending_against_software_supply_chain_attacks_508.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defending Against Software Supply Chain Attacks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;providing advice for creating secure open source apps. It starts with the creation of a formal supply chain risk management program to ensure that supply chain risk receives attention across the organization, even among executives and managers within operations and personnel across supporting roles, such as IT, acquisitions, legal, risk management, and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An organization can reduce its software attack surface through configuration management, the advisory says, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;placing configurations under change control;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;conducting security impact analyses;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;implementing manufacturer-provided guidelines to harden software, operating systems, and firmware;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;• maintaining an information system component inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Open Source Web Application Security Project (OWASP) offers this advice to developers using npm:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always vet and perform due diligence on third-party modules that you install to confirm their health and credibility;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;hold off on immediate upgrades to new versions; allow new package versions some time to circulate before trying them out.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;before upgrading, make sure to review changelogs and release notes for the upgraded version.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;when installing packages, make sure to add the &lt;em&gt;ignore-scripts&lt;/em&gt; suffix to disable the execution of any scripts by third-party packages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;consider adding &lt;em&gt;ignore-scripts&lt;/em&gt; to the .npmrc project file, or to the global npm configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.andrewkrug.com/bio/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Krug&lt;/a&gt;, Datadog’s head of security advocacy, offered these additional tips:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give developers the ability to install real-time package scanning at installation;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;guard against typosquatting and dependency confusion by prioritizing the use of internal package repositories as a guardrail for approved packages;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;maintain software bills of materials;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Deploy SCA (software composition analysis) at every phase of the software development lifecycle. Traditional SCA tools only periodically analyze code snapshots, he said, but effective detection must be complemented with real-time visibility into deployed services, including production, to reprioritize issues and focus on those exposed in sensitive environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Data Security Posture Management: Die besten DSPM-Tools</title>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Data Security Posture Management erfordert nicht nur die richtigen Tools, sondern auch eine entsprechende Vorbereitung." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3376718/1200x.jpg" title="Data Security Posture Management erfordert nicht nur die richtigen Tools, sondern auch eine entsprechende Vorbereitung." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Data Security Posture Management erfordert nicht nur die richtigen Tools, sondern auch eine entsprechende Vorbereitung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: Rawpixel.com | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Computing ist von Natur aus dynamisch und flüchtig: Daten können schnell und einfach erstellt, gelöscht oder verschoben werden. Das sorgt dafür, dass auch die Cloud-Angriffsfläche sehr dynamisch ist – was &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495736/cloud-security-strategie-in-die-cloud-aber-mit-sicherheit.html" target="_blank" title="Schutzmaßnahmen erschwert"&gt;Schutzmaßnahmen erschwert&lt;/a&gt;. Ein lästiges Problem stellt dabei insbesondere dar, sensible Daten innerhalb von Cloud-Umgebungen aufzuspüren. An dieser Stelle kommt Data Security Posture Management – kurz DSPM – ins Spiel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-ist-data-security-posture-management"&gt;Was ist Data Security Posture Management?&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich DSPM wurden in den vergangenen Jahren diverse Tools entwickelt, die dabei unterstützen, sowohl bekannte als auch unbekannte Daten zu erkennen, zu strukturieren und mit Blick auf Security und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494359/der-grose-ki-risiko-guide.html" target="_blank" title="Datenschutzrisiken"&gt;Datenschutzrisiken&lt;/a&gt; zu managen. Data Security Posture Management Tools können Sicherheitsentscheidern und ihren Teams dabei einen umfassenden Blick auf den Datenbestand des Unternehmens ermöglichen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das könnte Ihnen eventuell bekannt vorkommen – dennoch handelt es sich bei DSPM nicht um einen Abkömmling von &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2797438/was-sie-ueber-dlp-wissen-muessen.html" target="_blank" title="Data Loss Prevention"&gt;Data Loss Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (DLP). Der wesentliche Unterschied besteht darin, dass DSPM-Tools nicht darauf “warten”, dass Daten gestohlen oder exfiltriert werden. DSPM-Produkte sind darauf ausgerichtet, Daten zu finden – unabhängig davon, wo sie sich befinden und ob diese Speicherorte gut dokumentiert oder unstrukturiert sind. Dabei zielen Data Security Posture Management Tools insbesondere darauf ab, sogenannte “Schattendaten” aufzuspüren. Dabei handelt es sich zum Beispiel um Datenelemente, die von Entwicklern oder Backup-Prozessen erstellt wurden oder veraltete &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492659/datenlecks-finden-so-verhindern-sie-repository-leaks.html" target="_blank" title="Repositories"&gt;Repositories&lt;/a&gt;, die in längst vergessenen, nicht mehr aktualisierten Cloud-Containern schlummern. DSPM-Tools übernehmen dabei eine “Locator”-Funktion. Gefundene Probleme zu beheben, fällt eigentlich in den Bereich traditionellerer Toolsets – beispielsweise &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494258/threat-intelligence-datenbanken-in-einem-soar-die-richtigen-spielzuge-gegen-hacker.html" target="_blank" title="SOAR"&gt;SOAR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492608/was-ist-siem.html" target="_blank" title="SIEM"&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt; oder &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/de_de/what-is/cloud-native/cnapp.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="CNAPP"&gt;CNAPP&lt;/a&gt;. Inzwischen werden solche “Fix it”-Tools jedoch zunehmend von den Anbietern im Bereich Data Security Posture Management integriert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daten aufzuspüren, ist allerdings nur der erste Schritt des DSPM-Prozesses: Sobald diese gefunden sind, müssen sie katalogisiert, ausgewertet und in verschiedenen Dashboards zusammengefasst werden. Das kann schwierig sein, wenn keine strikten Sicherheitskontrollen vorhanden sind. Deshalb werben die meisten DSPM-Anbieter auch damit, dass Kundendaten immer in der Umgebung des Kunden bleiben – was in der Regel bedeutet, dass nicht die eigentlichen Daten, sondern Metadaten gesammelt werden. Das heißt bei den Anbietern “agentenloser” oder API-Zugriff und hat den Vorteil, dass große Datenmengen schnell gescannt werden können, um die Art ihrer Nutzung und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495397/gehackte-konten-verlorene-datendie-15-dicksten-datenschutzverletzungen-unseres-jahrhunderts.html" target="_blank" title="potenzielle Risikofaktoren"&gt;potenzielle Risikofaktoren&lt;/a&gt; zu verstehen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sobald die Daten entdeckt und die Metadaten gesammelt sind, besteht der nächste Schritt darin, regelmäßige Scans durchzuführen, um festzustellen, welche Änderungen vorgenommen werden. Die Betonung liegt dabei auf “regelmäßig”. Ergänzend hinzu kommt schließlich auch noch das Thema &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2803961/was-ist-data-governance.html" target="_blank" title="Data Governance"&gt;Data Governance&lt;/a&gt;: DSPM-Tools klassifizieren nach Risiken und können im Zusammenspiel mit anderen Security-Tools Richtlinien durchsetzen und Probleme beheben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Grundsätzlich bestehen DSPM-Tools aus mehreren Komponenten, darunter:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agenten und “agentless Collectors” (nützlich, um On-Premises-Daten zu tracken),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ein zentralisiertes Management-Dashboard,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scanner, die Datensammlungen erkennen und priorisieren,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-Lineage- und Usage-Karten sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance Assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das übergeordnete Ziel von DSPM-Produkten besteht darin, umfassendere &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495818/cloud-risiken-verwalten-so-wahlen-sie-das-passende-cspm-tool-aus.html" target="_blank" title="Cloud Security Posture Management"&gt;Cloud Security Posture Management&lt;/a&gt; (CSPM)-Tools zu ergänzen. Dabei fokussieren die DSPM-Werkzeuge jedoch nicht auf Cloud-Infrastrukturen selbst, sondern ausschließlich auf Daten sowie darauf, wie diese durch die verschiedenen Services genutzt werden. In vielen Fällen haben DSPM-Anbieter deswegen auch CSPM-Offerings im Portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="dspm-produkte-evaluieren"&gt;DSPM-Produkte evaluieren&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools im Bereich Data Security Posture Management zu evaluieren, erfordert erheblichen Personalaufwand, da viele verschiedene Aspekte der IT-Infrastruktur eines Unternehmens davon betroffen sind. Das ist allerdings auch gut so, schließlich wollen Sie ja auch alle relevanten Daten identifizieren. Hilfreich ist zu diesem Zweck insbesondere ein Plan, der die wichtigsten Daten nach Priorität ordnet. Ein weiterer Tipp: Dokumentieren Sie, wie die einzelnen DSPM-Tools ihre Data Map erstellen und wie diese – und die darauf basierenden Dashboards – zu interpretieren sind. Schließlich ist es bei der Entscheidung über ein DSPM-Tool essenziell zu wissen, welche spezifischen Cloud Services abgedeckt sind und welche (noch) nicht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Was die Preisgestaltung von DSPM-Tools angeht, ist diese im Regelfall flexibel gestaltet und hängt von diversen Faktoren ab. Das Gros der Anbieter setzt auf entsprechende Abo-Modelle. Sicher ist, dass das teuer wird: Sie dürfen pro Jahr mit einer sechsstelligen Summe rechnen. Eine weitere Vorwarnung: Es wird Sie einiges an Zeit und Mühe kosten, den Umfang, das Integrationsniveau und die enthaltenen Schutzfunktionen der einzelnen DSPM-Angebote bis ins letzte Detail zu durchdringen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-besten-dspm-tools"&gt;Die besten DSPM-Tools&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden haben wir die aktuell wichtigsten DSPM-Anbieter und ihre Offerings für Sie zusammengestellt. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nikkei’s Slack breach leaks sensitive data from more than 17,000 users</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086100/nikkeis-slack-breach-leaks-sensitive-data-from-more-than-17000-users.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japanese media company Nikkei has confirmed that a security breach of its Slack accounts has potentially leaked highly sensitive information from more than 17,000 of its users. Consultants point to the incident as yet another reminder of the dangers when non-corporate devices are allowed to access confidential corporate data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An employee’s personal computer was infected with a virus, leading to the leakage of Slack authentication credentials. It is believed that this information was used to gain unauthorized access to employee accounts,” Nikkei said in &lt;a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/news/announcements/1394.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a published statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The incident was identified in September and countermeasures such as changing passwords were implemented. Potentially leaked information includes the names, email addresses, and chat histories for 17,368 individuals registered on Slack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei statement added “Considering the incident’s significance and to ensure transparency, we voluntarily reported it to [Japan’s] &lt;a href="https://www.ppc.go.jp/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Personal Information Protection Commission&lt;/a&gt;. No leakage of information related to sources or reporting activities has been confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity consultant &lt;a href="https://formergov.com/directory/brianlevine" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, a directory of former government and military specialists, stressed that this is part of an ongoing trend of Slack breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is often increased risk when employees or contractors access company resources from non-company-managed devices. Recent attacks against Okta, MGM Resorts, and others have been linked to such unmanaged access,” Levine said, adding that last year, “an attacker exfiltrated more than [1 terabyte] of internal data from Disney’s Slack environment when a contractor had accessed Slack from an unmanaged device, bypassing monitoring tools.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/erik-avakian" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group, noted that one of the most concerning things about attacks similar to the Nikkei breach is that the attackers are often able to easily bypass MFA defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An employee’s computer gets hit by malware designed to steal credentials. The malware grabs Slack session tokens and cookies, then sends them to attacker command and control servers,” Avakian said. “With those stolen and likely active tokens, the attacker is able to log into Slack from their own device and access private channels and chat history without even triggering a multi-factor authentication prompt, since they reused an already-authenticated session.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avakian said that the nature of these attacks suggests that enterprise CISOs should consider procedural changes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This kind of attack would give threat actors “broad access to channels and integrations, which made the impact worse. Weaknesses around this incident shine a light on unmanaged or poorly protected devices, long-lived tokens, and not enough logging or alerts for suspicious sessions,” Avakian said. “Organizations can learn from these types of incident, and those using Slack, or any other widely used communications platform similar to Slack, should maintain a policy for revoking active sessions and refreshing tokens for affected users routinely, forcing password resets and rotating API tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyeman/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Man&lt;/a&gt;, a senior information security consultant with Online Business Systems, pointed out, “the larger discussion should be on the failings of the Nikkei IT/IS program to protect against some sort of attack that targeted its employees. Why are employees allowed to use Slack on personal devices?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So this is really an issue of risk management,” Man said. “In the case of Nikkei, it appears the exploitation was elsewhere [on the system]. The initial access allowed the miscreants to use credentials to gain access to Slack. That’s not a compromise of Slack itself, that’s a compromise of employee account authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thecyberdr.com/#about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Boyce&lt;/a&gt;, security consultant and CEO of The Cyber Dr., said the Nikkei incident represents “what happens when someone uses a personal device to get into work systems. Once that device gets hit with malware, it’s game over for the credentials. The part that worries me is this could happen anywhere. People forget how much sensitive stuff ends up in Slack: messages, files, links, sometimes even credentials. Once someone has that, they can poke around pretty freely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, it’s just another reminder that zero trust has to go all the way out to the edge, not just the network. You’ve got to know the device, use MFA tied to managed hardware, and control what data lives in those SaaS tools,” Boyce said. “You may be also asking ‘Well, do we do away with BYOD all together?’ And the short answer is ‘no’ but we do need to look at ways we can secure the workforce beyond company issued assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
