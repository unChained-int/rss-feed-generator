      <title>Six more vulnerabilities found in n8n automation platform</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128998/six-more-vulnerabilities-found-in-n8n-automation-platform.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six more vulnerabilities have been discovered in the n8n workflow platform used for building LLM-powered agents to connect business processes. Four of the six are rated as critical, carrying CVSS severity scores of 9.4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These vulnerabilities span multiple attack classes, from remote code execution and command injection to arbitrary file access and cross-site scripting, all targeting a platform that is frequently deployed with access to secrets, credentials, internal APIs, and business-critical logic,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-genkin-48075b213/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amit Genkin&lt;/a&gt;, a security researchers at Israel-based cloud security provider Upwind,&lt;a href="https://www.upwind.io/feed/six-n8n-cves-one-day-workflow-security" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; who blogged about the vulnerabilities this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute, said the vulnerabilities affect how n8n sandboxes the processes created by different users, and how the host is protected from users with access to n8n.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is less of an issue for a single user system,” he said in an email, “but n8n is often installed in shared environments. Given the number and severity of the vulnerabilities, it is fair to assume that this is more or less just the ‘tip of the iceberg’. At this point, multi user n8n deployments should be treated with care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery is the second major revelation of issues in the n8n platform this year. Four weeks ago, researchers at Cyera &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4113980/critical-rce-flaw-allows-full-takeover-of-n8n-ai-workflow-platform.html" target="_blank"&gt;published details of a critical vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, after it had been patched, that would allow unauthenticated attackers to completely take over n8n deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also last month, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115417/malicious-npm-packages-target-n8n-automation-platform-in-a-supply-chain-attack.html" target="_blank"&gt;it was learned that threat actors are targeting n8n&lt;/a&gt; by planting malicious packages on the npm registry that claim to be legitimate n8n add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs with n8n in their environments and developers using the platform should update to the latest version of the application to close the newly-found holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerabilities are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21893" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-21893&lt;/a&gt;, a command injection hole in the community edition of n8n. An unauthenticated user with administration permission could execute arbitrary system commands on the n8n host.&lt;br /&gt;“The risk is amplified by the trust typically placed in community extensions,” Upwinds said in its commentary, “making this a high-impact attack path that directly bridges application-level functionality with host-level execution.&lt;br /&gt;It carries a CVSS vulnerability score of 9.4;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25049" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25049&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse crafted expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system command execution on the host running n8n.&lt;br /&gt;“Because workflow expressions are a core and commonly used feature in n8n, this flaw significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation and enables full compromise of the underlying host,” commented Upwind in its blog;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25052" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25052&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. A vulnerability in the file access controls allows authenticated users with permission to create or modify workflows to read sensitive files from the n8n host system. This can be exploited to obtain critical configuration data and user credentials, leading to complete account takeover of any user on the instance;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25053" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25053&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. This is a vulnerability in the Git node that allows execution of system commands or arbitrary file access;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25051" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25051&lt;/a&gt;, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the handling of webhook responses and related HTTP endpoints. It carries a CVSS score of 8.5. &lt;br /&gt;Under certain conditions, the n8n Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox protection intended to isolate HTML responses may not be applied correctly. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this to execute malicious scripts with same-origin privileges when other users interact with the crafted workflow. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61917" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-61917&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 7.7. This is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by unsafe buffer allocation in n8n task runners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During an interview, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshe-hassan-82290a155/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moshe Hassan&lt;/a&gt;, Upwind’s vice-president of research and innovation, estimated that 83% of his firm’s customers use the n8n platform. But, he added, less than 25% use it in production and/or may have it exposed to the web. The rest, he said, are testing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he said those who are evaluating the platform could be at risk if the users enter identity tokens for cloud platforms such as AWS and others as part of their testing. And the fact that large numbers of developers are testing the latest AI-related applications makes it hard for security pros to contain the blast radius of potential vulnerabilities in IT environments, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally, to contain vulnerabilities, CSOs have to understand the business logic and data flow of any applications in their environments, Hassan noted. However, risk can be lowered through network segregation, he said, and in addition, engineering should be allowed to create sandboxes for thorough testing of applications before they go into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/large-migrant-smuggling-operation-in-bulgaria-leads-to-16-arrests</link>
      <description>A Bulgarian-led investigation, carried out in close cooperation with the Hellenic Police and supported by Europol, has led to the dismantlement of an organised criminal network involved in smuggling of migrants from Türkiye via Bulgaria and onward through Serbia or Romania towards Western European countries. The investigation was conducted within the framework of a regional Operational Taskforce established to target migrant smuggling networks using Bulgaria as a transit country.</description>

      <title>Substack data breach leaks users’ email addresses and phone numbers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128287/substack-data-breach-leaks-users-email-addresses-and-phone-numbers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Substack, a high-profile publishing platform widely used by academics, journalists, subject matter experts, and controversialists, has suffered a data breach affecting an unknown number of its creators and subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to emails sent out this week to some users, on February 3 the company “identified evidence” that a third party had exploited an unspecified weakness in the company’s systems to gain access to user email addresses, phone numbers and, more vaguely, “other internal metadata.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach happened in October 2025, which means that data, which the company said did not include credit card numbers, passwords, or financial information, has been exposed for up to four months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen. We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,” &lt;a href="https://lorichristian.substack.com/p/notice-of-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said the email&lt;/a&gt; from Substack CEO Chris Best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails you receive that may be suspicious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-passwords-to-lose"&gt;No passwords to lose&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time of publication, Substack had not yet made a web announcement about the breach, limiting itself to sending emails to users. This implies that the breach only affects a subset of its estimated 35 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the language of the email alert downplays the incident, describing the exposed data as merely being “shared without your permission.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that the breach was only discovered this week, after a four-month delay, raises the possibility that its scope could yet grow as Substack conducts deeper forensics. A &lt;a href="https://dailydarkweb.net/substack-data-breach-leads-to-leak-of-nearly-700000-records/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dark web source claimed&lt;/a&gt; the breach compromised 697,313 records, although this remains unconfirmed. It also reported that IDs from payment system Stripe, used by creators to receive payment from their subscribers, were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the wording of the email alert sent by the company, the breach only affects users who have Substack accounts; anyone who subscribes to a Substack creator’s newsletter directly using an email address shouldn’t be affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full extent of what was exposed is less clear. In addition to email addresses and phone numbers, the company mentioned “metadata,” a catch-all term. In its &lt;a href="https://substack.com/privacy#:~:text=What%20Information%20does%20Substack%20collect" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, Substack describes a wide range of data this might include, depending on how the site is used, including user IDs, profile pictures, biographies, and IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How should Substack users react? Normally, the advice after any data breach is to change the account password. However, Substack’s default access method is &lt;a href="https://faq.substack.com/p/logging-in-to-substack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;via email address&lt;/a&gt;, with authentication confirmed by sending a “magic link” to the user’s email address. This removes the problem of password compromise and phishing attacks by not having a password to phish. If optional multi-factor authentication is turned on, the user must additionally enter a onetime code from an app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passwords are still possible — users who signed up before 2023 might have one — but in 2026, the user must actively choose to create one. The company doesn’t mention whether this subset of users should consider changing their passwords as a precaution, but did offer the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We cannot share specifics about our security systems and processes, but we can confirm that the issue has been resolved and safeguards have been put in place to help prevent this issue from happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Substack’s only other known security incident happened in 2020 when it &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack#:~:text=On%20July%2028%2C%202020%2C" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accidentally exposed&lt;/a&gt; user email addresses by adding them to the “cc” (carbon copy) field instead of the “bcc” (blind carbon copy) of an email when sending out a policy update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>New APT group breached gov and critical infrastructure orgs in 37 countries</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128378/new-apt-group-breached-gov-and-critical-infrastructure-orgs-in-37-countries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new cyberespionage group that operates out of Asia has compromised 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year using a sophisticated toolset that combines phishing, exploitation kits, custom malware, Linux rootkits, web shells, and a variety of other tunneling and proxy tools. Researchers believe the group is expanding its activities and is conducting active reconnaissance on even more targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Between November and December 2025, we observed the group conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries,” researchers from security firm Palo Alto Networks said in &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/shadow-campaigns-uncovering-global-espionage/"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto tracks the group as TGR-STA-1030 (aka UNC6619) and believes it is based in Asia based on language settings, its preference for regional tooling, GMT+8 operating hours, and targeting that aligns with events in the region. The researchers, who have been tracking the group since February 2025, believe it has ties to a nation state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group’s confirmed victims include national-level law enforcement and border control entities; ministries and departments of interior, foreign affairs, finance, trade, economy, immigration, mining, justice, and energy; elected officials and even a parliament’s infrastructure. The group has also targeted national telecommunications companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets, and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services,” Palo Alto’s researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-phishing-to-exploits"&gt;From phishing to exploits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto started tracking the group a year ago following a series of phishing campaigns directed at European governments that the company dubbed the Shadow Campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing emails posed as announcements about organizational changes in official institutions and were written in the language of their intended targets. The messages contained links that led to the download of a ZIP archive with a custom malware loader the researchers now call Diaoyu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This loader performs various checks to detect the presence of certain antivirus programs and to ascertain whether it is running in a sandbox. It then proceeds to download the Cobalt Strike implant from a GitHub repository. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has grown popular among attackers over the years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the group hasn’t been observed exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities to gain access to networks, it has used exploits for known vulnerabilities (N-days) in a large number of software products, operating systems, and libraries, including: SAP Solution Manager, Microsoft Open Management Infrastructure, Microsoft Exchange Server, Pivotal Spring Data Commons, Struts2, Eyou Email System, Beijing Grandview Century eHR Software, Weaver Ecology-OA, Commvault CommCell CVSearchService, Zhiyuan OA, Microsoft Windows, networking products from Ruijieyi Networks and D-Link, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On one occasion, we observed the actor connecting to e-passport and e-visa services associated with a ministry of foreign affairs,” the researchers said. “Because the server for these services was configured with Atlassian Crowd software, the actor attempted to exploit CVE-2019-11580, uploading a payload named rce.jar.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-complex-toolset-of-implants"&gt;A complex toolset of implants&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Cobalt Strike, the group uses various other malware payloads and command-and-control (C2) frameworks, including VShell, Havoc, SparkRat, and Sliver. On compromised web servers, the attackers deploy a variety of web shells, including Behinder, Neo-reGeorg, and Godzilla.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Linux servers the group has been seen deploying a rootkit dubbed ShadowGuard, which leverages the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), a powerful feature for running sandboxed code inside the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“eBPF backdoors are notoriously difficult to detect because they operate entirely within the highly trusted kernel space,” the researchers said. “eBPF programs do not appear as separate modules. Instead, they execute inside the kernel’s BPF virtual machine, making them inherently stealthy. This allows them to manipulate core system functions and audit logs before security tools or system monitoring applications can see the true data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ShadowGuard appears to be a tool that’s unique to this group and allows them to hide processes, files, and directories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conceal outgoing network traffic from victim networks, the attackers use a variety of relay and proxy servers running tunneling software like the GO Simple Tunnel (GOST), Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS), and IOX, but their C2 servers are typically hosted on virtual private servers (VPS) from the US, UK, and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="increase-in-targeting"&gt;Increase in targeting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto believes the group is expanding its operations because it has scanned networks of organizations from 155 countries for known vulnerabilities since October. The scans appear to be targeted on IP addresses belonging to government infrastructure and specific targets of interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, during the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4066008/government-shutdown-deepens-us-cyber-risk-exposing-networks-to-threat-actors.html"&gt;US government shutdown that began in October&lt;/a&gt;, the group started scanning the infrastructure of governments in the Americas, including in Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. The researchers believe the group has already compromised entities in Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group seems to time its targeting to certain events. For example, when the president of Czechia met with the Dalai Lama in August, the group immediately started scanning the computer infrastructure belonging to the Czech Army, police, parliament, and presidency, as well as its ministries of interior, finance, and foreign affairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TGR-STA-1030 remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide,” Palo Alto said. “The group primarily targets government ministries and departments for espionage purposes. We assess that it prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s report includes indicators of compromise, including IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes for the implants used by the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
