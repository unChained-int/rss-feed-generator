      <title>Substack data breach leaks users’ email addresses and phone numbers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128287/substack-data-breach-leaks-users-email-addresses-and-phone-numbers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Substack, a high-profile publishing platform widely used by academics, journalists, subject matter experts, and controversialists, has suffered a data breach affecting an unknown number of its creators and subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to emails sent out this week to some users, on February 3 the company “identified evidence” that a third party had exploited an unspecified weakness in the company’s systems to gain access to user email addresses, phone numbers and, more vaguely, “other internal metadata.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach happened in October 2025, which means that data, which the company said did not include credit card numbers, passwords, or financial information, has been exposed for up to four months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen. We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,” &lt;a href="https://lorichristian.substack.com/p/notice-of-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said the email&lt;/a&gt; from Substack CEO Chris Best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails you receive that may be suspicious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-passwords-to-lose"&gt;No passwords to lose&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time of publication, Substack had not yet made a web announcement about the breach, limiting itself to sending emails to users. This implies that the breach only affects a subset of its estimated 35 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the language of the email alert downplays the incident, describing the exposed data as merely being “shared without your permission.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that the breach was only discovered this week, after a four-month delay, raises the possibility that its scope could yet grow as Substack conducts deeper forensics. A &lt;a href="https://dailydarkweb.net/substack-data-breach-leads-to-leak-of-nearly-700000-records/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dark web source claimed&lt;/a&gt; the breach compromised 697,313 records, although this remains unconfirmed. It also reported that IDs from payment system Stripe, used by creators to receive payment from their subscribers, were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the wording of the email alert sent by the company, the breach only affects users who have Substack accounts; anyone who subscribes to a Substack creator’s newsletter directly using an email address shouldn’t be affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full extent of what was exposed is less clear. In addition to email addresses and phone numbers, the company mentioned “metadata,” a catch-all term. In its &lt;a href="https://substack.com/privacy#:~:text=What%20Information%20does%20Substack%20collect" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, Substack describes a wide range of data this might include, depending on how the site is used, including user IDs, profile pictures, biographies, and IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How should Substack users react? Normally, the advice after any data breach is to change the account password. However, Substack’s default access method is &lt;a href="https://faq.substack.com/p/logging-in-to-substack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;via email address&lt;/a&gt;, with authentication confirmed by sending a “magic link” to the user’s email address. This removes the problem of password compromise and phishing attacks by not having a password to phish. If optional multi-factor authentication is turned on, the user must additionally enter a onetime code from an app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passwords are still possible — users who signed up before 2023 might have one — but in 2026, the user must actively choose to create one. The company doesn’t mention whether this subset of users should consider changing their passwords as a precaution, but did offer the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We cannot share specifics about our security systems and processes, but we can confirm that the issue has been resolved and safeguards have been put in place to help prevent this issue from happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Substack’s only other known security incident happened in 2020 when it &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack#:~:text=On%20July%2028%2C%202020%2C" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accidentally exposed&lt;/a&gt; user email addresses by adding them to the “cc” (carbon copy) field instead of the “bcc” (blind carbon copy) of an email when sending out a policy update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>New APT group breached gov and critical infrastructure orgs in 37 countries</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128378/new-apt-group-breached-gov-and-critical-infrastructure-orgs-in-37-countries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new cyberespionage group that operates out of Asia has compromised 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year using a sophisticated toolset that combines phishing, exploitation kits, custom malware, Linux rootkits, web shells, and a variety of other tunneling and proxy tools. Researchers believe the group is expanding its activities and is conducting active reconnaissance on even more targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Between November and December 2025, we observed the group conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries,” researchers from security firm Palo Alto Networks said in &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/shadow-campaigns-uncovering-global-espionage/"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto tracks the group as TGR-STA-1030 (aka UNC6619) and believes it is based in Asia based on language settings, its preference for regional tooling, GMT+8 operating hours, and targeting that aligns with events in the region. The researchers, who have been tracking the group since February 2025, believe it has ties to a nation state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group’s confirmed victims include national-level law enforcement and border control entities; ministries and departments of interior, foreign affairs, finance, trade, economy, immigration, mining, justice, and energy; elected officials and even a parliament’s infrastructure. The group has also targeted national telecommunications companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets, and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services,” Palo Alto’s researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-phishing-to-exploits"&gt;From phishing to exploits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto started tracking the group a year ago following a series of phishing campaigns directed at European governments that the company dubbed the Shadow Campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing emails posed as announcements about organizational changes in official institutions and were written in the language of their intended targets. The messages contained links that led to the download of a ZIP archive with a custom malware loader the researchers now call Diaoyu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This loader performs various checks to detect the presence of certain antivirus programs and to ascertain whether it is running in a sandbox. It then proceeds to download the Cobalt Strike implant from a GitHub repository. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has grown popular among attackers over the years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the group hasn’t been observed exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities to gain access to networks, it has used exploits for known vulnerabilities (N-days) in a large number of software products, operating systems, and libraries, including: SAP Solution Manager, Microsoft Open Management Infrastructure, Microsoft Exchange Server, Pivotal Spring Data Commons, Struts2, Eyou Email System, Beijing Grandview Century eHR Software, Weaver Ecology-OA, Commvault CommCell CVSearchService, Zhiyuan OA, Microsoft Windows, networking products from Ruijieyi Networks and D-Link, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On one occasion, we observed the actor connecting to e-passport and e-visa services associated with a ministry of foreign affairs,” the researchers said. “Because the server for these services was configured with Atlassian Crowd software, the actor attempted to exploit CVE-2019-11580, uploading a payload named rce.jar.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-complex-toolset-of-implants"&gt;A complex toolset of implants&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Cobalt Strike, the group uses various other malware payloads and command-and-control (C2) frameworks, including VShell, Havoc, SparkRat, and Sliver. On compromised web servers, the attackers deploy a variety of web shells, including Behinder, Neo-reGeorg, and Godzilla.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Linux servers the group has been seen deploying a rootkit dubbed ShadowGuard, which leverages the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), a powerful feature for running sandboxed code inside the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“eBPF backdoors are notoriously difficult to detect because they operate entirely within the highly trusted kernel space,” the researchers said. “eBPF programs do not appear as separate modules. Instead, they execute inside the kernel’s BPF virtual machine, making them inherently stealthy. This allows them to manipulate core system functions and audit logs before security tools or system monitoring applications can see the true data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ShadowGuard appears to be a tool that’s unique to this group and allows them to hide processes, files, and directories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conceal outgoing network traffic from victim networks, the attackers use a variety of relay and proxy servers running tunneling software like the GO Simple Tunnel (GOST), Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS), and IOX, but their C2 servers are typically hosted on virtual private servers (VPS) from the US, UK, and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="increase-in-targeting"&gt;Increase in targeting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto believes the group is expanding its operations because it has scanned networks of organizations from 155 countries for known vulnerabilities since October. The scans appear to be targeted on IP addresses belonging to government infrastructure and specific targets of interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, during the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4066008/government-shutdown-deepens-us-cyber-risk-exposing-networks-to-threat-actors.html"&gt;US government shutdown that began in October&lt;/a&gt;, the group started scanning the infrastructure of governments in the Americas, including in Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. The researchers believe the group has already compromised entities in Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group seems to time its targeting to certain events. For example, when the president of Czechia met with the Dalai Lama in August, the group immediately started scanning the computer infrastructure belonging to the Czech Army, police, parliament, and presidency, as well as its ministries of interior, finance, and foreign affairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TGR-STA-1030 remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide,” Palo Alto said. “The group primarily targets government ministries and departments for espionage purposes. We assess that it prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s report includes indicators of compromise, including IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes for the implants used by the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Customer Identity &amp;amp; Access Management (CIAM) bildet eine Unterkategorie von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495114/identity-access-managementdie-9-besten-iam-tools.html" target="_blank" title="Identity &amp;amp; Access Management"&gt;Identity &amp;amp; Access Management&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495781/identity-access-management-umsetzen-6-anzeichen-dass-ihre-iam-strategie-nichts-taugt.html" target="_blank" title="IAM"&gt;IAM&lt;/a&gt;). CIAM wird dazu eingesetzt, die Authentifizierungs- und Autorisierungsprozesse von Applikationen zu managen, die öffentlich zugänglich sind, beziehungsweise von Kunden bedient werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geht es darum, die für Ihr Unternehmen passende CIAM-Lösung zu ermitteln, gilt es, die Benutzerfreundlichkeit mit einer langen Liste von Geschäftszielen und -anforderungen ins Gleichgewicht zu bringen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketingverantwortliche&lt;/strong&gt; wollen Daten über Kunden und deren Geräte sammeln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Datenschutzbeauftragte&lt;/strong&gt; wollen sicherstellen, dass alle Prozesse mit den Datenschutzbestimmungen in Einklang stehen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security- und Risiko-Entscheider&lt;/strong&gt; wollen die Integrität der Konten sicherstellen und die betrügerische Nutzung von Anmeldedaten so weit wie möglich verhindern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Sie bei diesem heiklen Balanceakt zu unterstützen, haben wir die derzeit besten Lösungen, die der Markt für Customer Identity &amp;amp; Access Management zu bieten hat, für Sie zusammengestellt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="empfehlenswerte-customer-identity-access-management-tools"&gt;Empfehlenswerte Customer Identity &amp;amp; Access Management Tools&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die folgenden CIAM-Plattformen und -Lösungen werden von Analysten und Kunden aufgrund ihres Funktionsumfangs, ihrer Erweiterbarkeit und ihrer Benutzerfreundlichkeit bevorzugt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-identity" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="IBM Security Verify"&gt;IBM Security Verify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Enterprise-Bereich erhält IBMs Security Verify gute Noten für seine robuste Infrastruktur, die durch eine containersierte Multi-Cloud-Architektur gestützt wird. Diese ist nicht nur skalierbar, sondern bietet Unternehmen auch die Möglichkeit, isolierte Kundeninstanzen zu managen. Dabei bietet die IBM-Lösung Support für eine Vielzahl von Authentifizierungsstandards, inklusive FIDO 2 Server-Zertifizierung. Um Marketing-Analysen oder BI-Funktionen zu integrieren, können die Kunden entweder das IBM-eigene Ökosystem oder Drittanbieter über ein ausgedehntes Konnektoren-Portfolio ins Boot holen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein wichtiges Alleinstellungsmerkmal des IBM-Produkts: Während viele andere CIAM-Produkte in Sachen risikobasierte Authentifizierung und Betrugsbekämpfung nur Integrationsoptionen anbieten können, bringt Security Verify diese Funktionen nativ mit: Die “Trusteer”-Funktionen nutzen Analysefunktionen, um Betrug mit Hilfe von KI-gestütztem, adaptivem Zugriff zu reduzieren. Das System nutzt eine Kombination aus Anomalieerkennung, Erkennung von Betrugsmustern und anderen passiven Verhaltensanalysen, um die Vertrauenswürdigkeit eines Kontos zu bewerten und die Authentifizierungsanforderungen entsprechend anzupassen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus bietet die IBM-Lösung auch ein Self-Service-Portal für die Benutzer, um Einwilligungen zu managen sowie eine &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495562/4-security-aspekte-low-code-heist-nicht-low-risk.html" target="_blank" title="Low-Code/No-Code"&gt;Low-Code/No-Code&lt;/a&gt;-Management-Funktion, die Datenschutzbeauftrage und Business-Entscheidern ermöglicht, Datenschutzrichtlinien und -anforderungen ohne die Hilfe von Softwareentwicklern festzulegen und zu optimieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.loginradius.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="LoginRadius"&gt;LoginRadius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Sie in Sachen CIAM eine schlüsselfertige Lösung suchen, die für ihre einfache Implementierung und Bedienung bekannt ist, sollten Sie einen Blick auf das Angebot von LoginRadius werfen: Sie bringt umfassenden API-Support mit und lässt sich in vielfacher Hinsicht an ihre Bedürfnisse anpassen. Allerdings handelt es sich hierbei nicht um eine Plattform, die für umfangreiche Code-Anpassungen unter der Haube gedacht ist. Vielmehr adressiert sie als &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2802722/was-sie-ueber-no-code-plattformen-wissen-muessen.html" target="_blank" title="No-Code-Lösung"&gt;No-Code-Lösung&lt;/a&gt; Unternehmen, die wenig bis gar keine Entwicklungsarbeit leisten wollen oder können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Onboarding-Workflows werden über eine grafische Benutzeroberfläche abgewickelt, Richtlinien über Dropdown-Listen erstellt. Zu Integrationszwecken steht ein Marktplatz mit vordefinierten Konnektoren zur Verfügung. Darüber hinaus enthält die CIAM-Plattform auch eine integrierte Analyse-Engine mit Dutzenden von Reportings für Marketing- und Identitätsanalysen. Um Datenschutz- und Compliance-Anforderungen gerecht zu werden, stehen grundlegende Consent-Management- und Self-Service-Funktionen zur Verfügung – zudem wird etwa Social Login unterstützt. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für die einfache Bedienung und die Deployment-Vorzüge opfern Unternehmen ein gewisses Maß an Kontrolle: So verfügt das Tool zwar über eine Authentifizierungs-Risiko-Engine, bietet aber nur wenig Kontrolle über dessen Priorisierung. Für Betrugserkennungs-Funktionen von Drittanbietern stehen nicht besonders viele Konnektoren zur Verfügung und Geräteattribute werden für Risikobewertungen und -analysen zwar untersucht, allerdings nur in begrenztem Umfang.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/security/business/microsoft-entra" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Microsoft Entra"&gt;Microsoft Entra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft ist zwar ein wichtiger Akteur auf dem breiteren IAM-Markt, arbeitet sich in Sachen CIAM aber immer noch auf der Reifegradskala nach oben. Im Rahmen ihrer letzten großen Access-Management-Analyse argumentierten die Marktforscher von Gartner, die CIAM-Funktionen von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495134/neue-angriffsmoglichkeitenwie-azure-ad-neue-authentifizierungsrisiken-eroffnet.html" target="_blank" title="Azure AD"&gt;Azure AD&lt;/a&gt; seien im Vergleich zu den Konkurrenzangeboten unausgereift, weswegen die meisten Kunden das Produkt nur für Workforce-Szenarien verwendeten. Seitdem ist allerdings viel passiert: Microsoft hat mit Nachdruck in sein gesamtes Identity-Portfolio investiert und sich mit einer neuen Produktlinie namens Entra positioniert. Diese umfasst nun das komplette Azure-AD-Paket, inklusive der CIAM-Funktionalitäten von Azure AD External Identities – zudem wurde auch die Open-Standard-Plattform Verified ID in den Mix aufgenommen. Microsoft setzt auf dieses dezentrale Identitätsnachweis-Ökosystem in erster Linie für Mitarbeiterszenarien und setzt damit einen langfristigen strategischen Schwerpunkt, der sich vermutlich auch auf externe Anwendungsfälle erstrecken wird.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trotz einiger großer Funktionslücken – etwa fehlende Consumer Privacy Dashboards oder der eher rudimentären Adaptive-Authentication-Policy-Konstruktion – hat Azure AD External Identities Vorteile: Es ist extrem skalierbar, einfach zu bedienen und verfügt über einige starke Account-Takeover-Schutzmechanismen. Zudem lässt es sich gut mit Microsofts BI- und CRM-Plattformen für erweiterte Analysen integrieren und bietet ein kontinuierlich wachsendes Integrations-Ökosystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://auth0.com/ciam" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Okta / Auth0"&gt;Okta / Auth0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nach der Übernahme von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492807/interview-mit-jameeka-green-aarondie-gefahrenlage-aus-sicht-einer-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="Auth0"&gt;Auth0&lt;/a&gt; will Okta das CIAM-Produkt von Auth0 als eigenständiges Angebot neben den hauseigenen CIAM-Funktionen beibehalten, um Kunden maximale Flexibilität bei der Implementierung zu bieten. Nichtsdestotrotz wird es zu Überschneidungen und Integrationen kommen – Okta hat bereits mehrere Funktionen kombiniert, um die Fähigkeit zu Zusammenarbeit und Innovation zu beschleunigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auth0 bietet zwar einige Workforce-IAM-Funktionen an, aber diese Plattform ist mit CIAM-Anwendungsfällen groß geworden – entsprechend stark ausgeprägt ist der Fokus auf diesen Bereich. Laut den Analysten von Gartner eignet sich die CIAM-Lösung von Auth0 vor allem dann, wenn Entwickler Access Management für Verbraucher in individuell entwickelte, API-lastige Anwendungen einbauen müssen. Dazu kombiniert die Plattform “großartige UX-Flows und UI-Anpassungsfähigkeiten” mit “umfassenden Entwickler-Tools und vollständiger API-Unterstützung”, heißt es in Gartners Magic Quadrant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das gesamte Okta-CIAM-Portfolio verfügt über eine Reihe von Konnektoren für Business Intelligence, CRM, Marketing-Analytics und -Automatisierung, andere IAM-Plattformen, beliebte SaaS-Anwendungen und Plattformen zur Betrugsbekämpfung. Raum nach oben gibt es bei diesem Produkt, wenn es darum geht, Geräteintelligenz und Verhaltensbiometrie in die nativen Funktionen der Plattform zu integrieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.onelogin.com/solutions/ciam" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="OneLogin"&gt;OneLogin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Identity-as-a-Service (IdaaS)-Anbieter OneLogin gehört in Gartners Magic Quadrant für Access Management zur Spitzengruppe und bietet einige abgespeckte, entwicklerfreundliche CIAM-Funktionen. Die könnten speziell für Unternehmen, die eine erschwingliche Option für den Aufbau einer stärkeren Kundenauthentifizierung suchen, hilfreich sein. Laut Gartner liegt die Stärke von OneLogin auch in den erschwinglichen Preisen, die das Unternehmen für externe Zugriffsmanagement-Anwendungen aufruft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Lösung selbst zeichnet sich dabei durch seine flexible Erweiterbarkeit mit umfangreicher Entwicklerunterstützung und seine robusten APIs aus. Die Serverless Smart-Hooks-&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2790525/was-sie-ueber-application-programming-interfaces-wissen-muessen.html" target="_blank" title="API"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;-Funktion soll Entwickler dabei unterstützen, CIAM-Workflows und -Richtlinien anzupassen, um möglichst nahtlose und sichere Benutzererfahrungen während der Anmeldung zu gewährleisten. Entlastung gibt es auch, wenn es um Single-Sign-On geht – auch hier unterstützt das Tool dabei, entsprechende Funktionen in Consumer-Apps einzubauen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen CIAM-Lösungen in dieser Übersicht, gehören allerdings keine Out-of-the-Box-Funktionen für Consent Management oder geschäftsorientierte Funktionen wie Marketing-Analysen und Automatisierung zum Paket – es handelt sich in erster Linie um eine Authentifizierungs- und Autorisierungslösung.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nach der Übernahme durch One Identity war erwartet worden, dass sich das Portfolio stärker in Richtung Workforce IAM entwickeln wird. Davon ist ein Jahr später allerdings noch nichts zu sehen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/de/platform/solutions/pingone-for-customers.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ping Identity"&gt;Ping Identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492443/iam-deal-thoma-bravo-kauft-ping-identity.html" target="_blank" title="Ping Identity"&gt;Ping Identity&lt;/a&gt; ist einer der ersten Enterprise-IAM-Anbieter, der in CIAM-Gewässer abtaucht. Dabei überzeugt er vor allem in Sachen Identitäsnachweise, -orchestrierung und Analytics-Funktionen – auch der Umfang der unterstützten Authentifikatoren sowie die Dokumentation und Sicherheit der API-Konnektoren sind positiv hervorzuheben. Ein “Fraud”-Modul spürt darüber hinaus mit Hilfe von Echtzeit-Verhaltensnavigation, Verhaltensbiometrie, Geräte- und Netzwerkattributen potenzielle, betrügerische Angriffe auf. Auch die Integration mit externen Betrugserkennungs-Plattformen ist möglich. Ping Identity hebt sich von anderen Anbietern zudem dadurch ab, dass es den FIDO-2-Standard nicht nur unterstützt, sondern einen entsprechend zertifizierten Server betreibt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die &lt;a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80466/ciam-platforms" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Analysten von KuppingerCole"&gt;Analysten von KuppingerCole&lt;/a&gt; sehen auch Schwachpunkte, etwa die nur rudimentäre Verwaltung von Berechtigungen für Verbraucher, die in den meisten Fällen zusätzliche Entwicklungs- und Integrationsarbeit erfordern. Auch die noch in der Entwicklung befindlichen Out-of-the-Box-Konnektoren für erweiterte Business Intelligence, Customer Relationship Management und Marketing-Analytics bemängeln die Analysten – bewerten das Ping-Identity-Offering aber dennoch sehr positiv. Laut Gartner gehört Ping Identity zu den “erschwinglicheren Optionen auf dem CIAM-Markt”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im August 2023 übernahm der Ping-Identity-Mutterkonzern Thoma Bravo &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-of-forgerock-combines-forgerock-into-ping-identity-301908059.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="den Sicherheitsanbieter Forge Rock"&gt;den Sicherheitsanbieter Forge Rock&lt;/a&gt; – und integrierte dessen Potfolio in Ping Identity.

      <title>Software developers: Prime cyber targets and a rising risk vector for CISOs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4127693/software-developers-prime-cyber-targets-and-a-rising-risk-vector-for-cisos.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threats against corporate software developers are increasing and diversifying, challenging security leaders to develop more agile defenses against this growing attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers are increasingly targeting the tools, access, and trusted channels used by software developers rather than simply exploiting application bugs. The threats blend technical compromise — malicious packages, development pipeline abuse, etc. — with social engineering and AI-driven attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Attackers are no longer just trying to break into the network; they are trying to break into the workflow,” says &lt;a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/author/chris-wood"&gt;Chris Wood&lt;/a&gt;, principal application security SME at cybersecurity firm Immersive. “By compromising the tools developers trust implicitly, like extensions and package registries, they can poison the well before a single line of code is written.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tokens, API keys, cloud credentials, and CI/CD secrets held by software developers unlock far broader access than a typical office user account, making software engineers a prime target for cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They [developers] hold the keys to the kingdom, privileged access to source code and cloud infrastructure, making them a high-value target,” Wood adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts quizzed by CSO said the threat against software developers can be broken into several categories, including: malicious extensions, IDE plugins, and tools; supply chain and dependency attacks; credential theft and environment compromise; social engineering; and AI risks in software development workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malicious utilities poison the ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darren Meyer, security research advocate at application security firm Checkmarx, sees most attacks targeting developers as “low-effort” and untargeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, attackers plant tainted open-source packages on &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570173/what-is-typosquatting-a-simple-but-effective-attack-technique.html"&gt;typosquatting&lt;/a&gt; domains to trick developers into installing malicious versions of popular utilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But spray-and-pray efforts are only part of the story. More targeted attacks are also in play, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095578/new-shai-hulud-worm-spreading-through-npm-github.html"&gt;Shai-Hulud worm hack against GitHub and other software development platforms&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://checkmarx.com/zero-post/chalk-and-17-other-npm-packages-compromised-in-supply-chain-attack/"&gt;recent assault against npm package Chalk&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to compromise the Visual Studio Code plugin ecosystem, Meyer warns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meyer’s warning about tainted open-source packages is backed up by recent study by DevSecOps firm Sonatype that identified 1.233 million malicious packages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Known vulnerable components also pose a massive risk. Four years after the vulnerability was patched, versions of Log4j vulnerable to the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574261/log4shell-remains-a-big-threat-and-a-common-cause-for-security-breaches.html"&gt;Log4Shell vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; were downloaded 42 million times last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/Introduction"&gt;Sonatype’s latest State of the Software Supply Chain&lt;/a&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credential theft &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; environment compromise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers aren’t just looking for flaws in code — they’re looking for access to software development environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common security shortcomings, including overprivileged service accounts, long-lived tokens, and misconfigured pipelines, offer a ready means for illicit entry into sensitive software development environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Improperly stored access credentials are low-hanging fruit for even the most amateur of threat actors,” says Crystal Morin, senior cybersecurity strategist at cloud-native security and observability vendor Sysdig.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="malicious-insider-threats"&gt;Malicious insider threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers are also looking for ways to infiltrate targeted enterprises by posing as software development contractors or remote hire workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fake worker schemes, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4033022/how-not-to-hire-a-north-korean-it-spy-3.html"&gt;a popular tactic spearheaded by North Korean threat actors&lt;/a&gt;, rely on using technically skilled individuals with falsified identities who use social engineering trickery to fool victims into hiring them. Once inside, these moles steal data and sensitive secrets that serve as collateral for blackmail scams, among other ruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve also seen threat actors pretend to be maintainers and commit malicious code to open-source projects with the goal of infecting users of popular packages, which was the case with the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2077692/dangerous-xz-utils-backdoor-was-the-result-of-years-long-supply-chain-compromise-effort.html"&gt;XZ Utils backdoor&lt;/a&gt; (CVE-2024-3094),” says Sysdig’s Morin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="software-supply-chain-risks"&gt;Software supply chain risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A compromised dependency such as a shared software library can taint the code of any developer that relies on it, leading to a large and growing &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4081492/modern-supply-chain-attacks-and-their-real-world-impact.html"&gt;software supply chain risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tenable.com/profile/gavin-millard"&gt;Gavin Millard&lt;/a&gt;, VP of intelligence at exposure management company Tenable, says threats from the software supply chain have supplanted exploits to become the greatest systemic cybersecurity risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Software supply chain risks mean the attack surface has expanded beyond traditional vulnerabilities and stolen credentials to the hijacking of maintainer accounts on platforms such as npm or PyPI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As evidenced by the recent &lt;a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/4047739/wave-of-npm-supply-chain-attacks-exposes-thousands-of-enterprise-developer-credentials.html"&gt;S1ngularity and npm maintainer hijacks&lt;/a&gt;, a single poisoned update in a common library can achieve more in minutes than a year spent sending targeted phishing messages or scanning the internet for exposed systems,” Millard tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Abusing the supply chain offers a “force multiplier” for any adversary, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For a mainstream user, a breach is a data leak, but for a developer, it’s a poisoned well that could infect every application they develop and every user of their products downstream,” Millard explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the resilience of supply chains against cyberattacks are growing. The &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-cybersecurity-outlook-2026/digest/"&gt;World Economic Forum’s latest annual Global Cybersecurity Outlook report&lt;/a&gt; shows that 65% of large enterprises report that third-party and supply chain vulnerabilities are their greatest challenge, a figure that has risen from 54% in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Developers routinely pull code from public registries, install third-party dependencies, grant automation broad permissions and publish artefacts that downstream systems implicitly trust,” says Christopher Jess, senior R&amp;amp;D manager at application security firm Black Duck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Attackers are exploiting that reality by shifting left into the developer toolchain by poisoning open-source packages, typosquatting popular libraries, publishing malicious extensions into IDE marketplaces, and targeting build systems where a single compromised pipeline can affect every environment,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="blended-threat-model"&gt;Blended threat model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers have also begun blending technical compromise with social engineering to increase the potency of their attacks, Jess notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A malicious package may be seeded with subtle backdoors, then amplified through convincing outreach with fake maintainer messages, urgent security-fix pull requests, or impersonation of trusted collaborators to accelerate adoption,” Jess explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI is raising the scale and precision of these attacks: phishing and pretexting can be more contextual — matching repo names, commit history, and team roles — and adversaries can generate plausible code changes or documentation that reduce suspicion during review,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-assisted development increases exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI-assisted development and “vibe coding” are increasing exposure to risk, especially because such code is often generated quickly without adequate testing, documentation, or traceability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/beckland/"&gt;Jamie Beckland&lt;/a&gt;, chief product officer at cybersecurity firm APIContext, warns that as software development teams adopt AI agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, a new, growing risk is &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015222/mcp-uses-and-risks.html"&gt;tool sprawl with opaque permissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“MCP servers can be modified by adding tools designed to exfiltrate data from internal APIs, data stores, or SaaS systems,” Beckland says. “The risk isn’t just the LLM model, it’s the tooling surface area and what those tools can reach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Monitoring MCP servers for changes in the tool infrastructure, and the data access rights of the server, is critical to verify changes in tools and requests.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.securecodewarrior.com/about-us/pieter-danhieux"&gt;Pieter Danhieux&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and co-founder of cybersecurity education firm Secure Code Warrior, adds that MCPs and AI agents are fertile ground for attackers because it is easy to “purposely introduce an insecure prompt or insert AI-augmented malicious code.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we’ve seen threat actors exploit user identity in new ways, namely with the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109123/managing-agentic-ai-risk-lessons-from-the-owasp-top-10.html"&gt;confused deputy vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; where threat actors will fool AI agents into taking unauthorized actions on behalf of the user,” Danhieux says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sonatype’s analysis of 37,000 recommendations shows that GPT-5 hallucinated 27.8% of component versions and even suggested actual malware packages in some cases, a statistic that emphasises the need for human code review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://baxbench.com/"&gt;BaxBench&lt;/a&gt;, 62% of the solutions generated even by the best large language model (LLMs) are either incorrect or contain a security vulnerability, highlighting that LLMs cannot yet generate deployment-ready code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs need to “stop obsessing over individual vulnerabilities and start mastering their total exposure, including the provenance of the shared libraries automatically pulled in via AI code assistants,” Tenable’s Millard says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="countermeasures"&gt;Countermeasures&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs, hardening software development environments requires a blend of technical controls, security education and creating a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;security-aware culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tighter identity verification checks, credential hygiene and least-privilege access to data offer steps to building greater security maturity into software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Well-known solutions to these problems include isolating workspaces in containers, centralizing image and secret management, and enforcing regular audits and procedure logging, all of which can effectively reduce the danger,” says &lt;a href="https://ericpaulsen.io/"&gt;Eric Paulsen&lt;/a&gt;, CTO for EMEA at software development platform provider Coder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Best practice has always been to pin workflow actions against immutable SHA hashes stored on tamper-proof hardware modules, according to David Sugden, head of engineering at digital transformation consultancy Axiologik.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Similarly, allow lists, secrets scanning, and software composition analysis continue to form DevSecOps baselines that increase protection,” Sugden says. “Gating direct access to external dependencies offers protection against malicious packages and versions, as well as preventing downloads for older, insecure packages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeljayburch/"&gt;Michael Burch&lt;/a&gt;, application security advocate at cybersecurity training firm Security Journey, emphasizes the importance of offering software developers continuous, hands-on training.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Developers need realistic exercises that demonstrate impact. Allow them to see how systems fail and empower them to fix issues themselves,” Burch advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many companies today invest significant resources to secure their internal IT. Firewalls, monitoring, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829684/how-to-create-an-effective-incident-response-plan.html" target="_blank"&gt;incident response plans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;awareness programs&lt;/a&gt; are well-established. At the same time, a dangerous illusion is growing: the assumption that risks can be controlled within the boundaries of one’s own system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reality is quite different. Modern business models are virtually inconceivable without external IT service providers, cloud services, software vendors, and specialized subcontractors. This is precisely where the greatest uncertainties arise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568787/eus-nis2-directive-for-cybersecurity-resilience-enters-full-enforcement.html"&gt;NIS2&lt;/a&gt; addresses this development and clarifies that cybersecurity doesn’t end at the company’s own firewall. The guideline compels companies to reassess their supply chains not only technically, but also strategically. It makes external dependencies an integral part of the security architecture and thus a management responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nis2-shifts-the-focus-of-systems-to-dependencies"&gt;NIS2 shifts the focus of systems to dependencies.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At its core, NIS2 follows a clear approach: Risks should be addressed where they originate. Statistics and incident analyses have shown for years that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4051668/71-of-cisos-hit-with-third-party-security-incident-this-year.html"&gt;attacks are increasingly carried out via third parties&lt;/a&gt;. Software updates, maintenance access, or outsourced services serve as entry points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 addresses this by explicitly including supply chains in its scope. Companies are obligated to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4119475/13-cyber-questions-to-better-vet-it-vendors-and-reduce-third-party-risk.html"&gt;assess risks related to their direct service providers as well as downstream subcontractors&lt;/a&gt;. The decisive factor is no longer whether an incident originates internally or externally, but rather its impact on critical services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This marks a departure from a purely technical understanding of security in the regulatory framework. It demands a structured management of dependencies that makes risks visible and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-supply-chains-are-particularly-vulnerable"&gt;Why supply chains are particularly vulnerable&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The supply chain is an attractive target for attackers for several reasons. External partners often have privileged access, work with sensitive data, or are deeply integrated into operational processes. At the same time, they are often not subject to the same security standards as large organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there is a structural lack of transparency. Companies often don’t know which other service providers their partners use or how access is technically implemented. This lack of visibility leads to a fragmented security landscape in which risks are known but remain unquantifiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 addresses this issue directly and requires transparent processes for identifying, assessing, and monitoring these risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-break-with-traditional-compliance"&gt;The break with traditional compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations are accustomed to formally fulfilling regulatory requirements. Questionnaires are sent out, certificates are filed, checklists are ticked off. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4002765/third-party-risk-management-is-broken-but-not-beyond-repair.html"&gt;This approach generates documentation, but not security&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 makes it clear that formal compliance is not enough. The directive requires the effective implementation of security measures and verifiable monitoring of their effectiveness. This also applies to, and especially applies to, external partners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A security concept that relies solely on self-reported information no longer meets the requirements. A realistic picture of the actual security maturity along the supply chain is needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-nis2-specifically-expects-from-companies"&gt;What NIS2 specifically expects from companies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 does not specify detailed technical requirements but defines clear objectives. Companies must identify, prioritize, and appropriately manage risks. For supply chains, this entails several key tasks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, dependencies must be systematically identified. Which service providers are essential for operations? What data do they process? What access rights do they have?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Secondly, appropriate security requirements must be defined. These must be commensurate with the risk and contractually stipulated.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Third, NIS2 requires continuous monitoring. Risks change. Business models, threat landscapes, and technical architectures evolve. Security assessments must therefore not be a one-off project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-role-of-the-ciso-under-nis2"&gt;The role of the CISO under NIS2&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs, NIS2 represents a significant expansion of their responsibilities. Technical excellence alone is no longer sufficient. Communication skills, risk assessment, and the ability to enforce security requirements across the organization are now essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO becomes the intermediary between technology, management, procurement, and legal. They must explain why certain requirements are necessary, what risks exist, and what the consequences of inaction might be. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3845430/nis2-the-time-for-compliance-has-come-but-the-race-for-cios-is-not-over.html"&gt;NIS2 strengthens this role&lt;/a&gt; by defining clear responsibilities and anchoring the importance of cybersecurity at the board level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-many-supply-chain-assessments-go-wrong"&gt;Why many supply chain assessments go wrong&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, supply chain assessments often fail for the following three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of prioritization:&lt;/strong&gt; Companies try to treat all partners equally and lose focus on the truly critical dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of enforceability:&lt;/strong&gt; Safety requirements are formulated but not checked or consistently enforced in case of deviations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational silos:&lt;/strong&gt; Purchasing, IT, and legal departments operate separately. As a result, security risks are viewed in a fragmented way and not managed holistically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 makes it clear that these approaches are no longer sufficient. An integrated risk management system is required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="control-mechanisms-with-substance"&gt;Control mechanisms with substance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective control &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4108294/implementing-nis2-without-ending-up-in-a-paper-war.html"&gt;does not mean maximum bureaucracy&lt;/a&gt;. The quality of the measures is crucial. For critical partners, this could include regular technical assessments, structured audits, or clearly defined escalation processes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is important that companies retain the ability to assess risks independently and do not completely outsource them to third parties. NIS2 requires taking responsibility, not delegating it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Control mechanisms must also be scalable. Not every partner requires the same level of effort. The potential impact of a security incident is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chains-as-a-strategic-resilience-factor"&gt;Supply chains as a strategic resilience factor&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies that view NIS2 as a purely compliance-related task are missing out on potential. A realistic assessment of supply chains not only strengthens their regulatory position but also increases operational stability. Transparent dependencies, clear security requirements, and effective control processes reduce the risk of disruption and improve responsiveness in emergencies. Supply chains are thus transformed from a weak point into a strategic resource.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion-nis2-forces-honesty"&gt;Conclusion: NIS2 forces honesty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 confronts companies with an uncomfortable truth: Cybersecurity doesn’t end at the boundaries of their own systems. Those who outsource critical processes remain responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The directive calls for an honest assessment of dependencies, risks, and the ability to control them. For CISOs, this presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Supply chains are no longer a side issue under NIS2. They are the touchstone for effective cybersecurity and sustainable resilience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
