      <title>Government considered destroying its data hub after decade-long intrusion</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074876/government-considered-destroying-its-data-hub-after-decade-long-intrusion.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Chinese-sponsored cyber attack was so damaging that it was briefly proposed that an entire data hub be destroyed, according to &lt;a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/here-be-dragons-the-truth-about-chinese-espionage/"&gt;British news magazine The Spectator&lt;/a&gt;. It observed that the attack accessing confidential UK government data was just one manifestation of a continuing series of threats to British IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That breach is but one example of the risks faced not only by the UK, but by governments and organizations everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-15/china-accessed-classified-uk-systems-for-a-decade-officials-say"&gt;news service Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;, two former senior security officials and other government officials familiar with the matter revealed that China has routinely accessed low- and medium-level classification information on UK government servers for at least a decade. This included information marked “official-sensitive” and “secret,” in addition to some material on the government’s secure IT networks, although no information designated “top secret” was compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chinese threats to the UK infrastructure are very much at the forefront of government thinking right now, given the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgd5jgzdweo"&gt;collapse of the trial&lt;/a&gt; of two Britons accused of passing secret documents to Chinese authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack on the data hub, through which classified government information was exchanged, came about following the sale of the company controlling it to a Chinese entity. While the destruction of the data hub was considered, the government found alternative ways to protect the data, according to Bloomberg. However, the breach was serious enough for then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to commission a report on threats, including digital surveillance and cyber attacks, posed by China. That report was never publicly released and, The Spectator said, technical details of the attack on the hub remain classified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-hub-attack-particularly-critical"&gt;Data hub attack ‘particularly critical’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack on the data hub is seen as particularly critical. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakemooreuk/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Jake Moore&lt;/a&gt;, global cybersecurity advisor with software company ESET said,  “The fact that ministers once considered destroying a data hub holding sensitive government data after it was sold to a China-aligned entity shows how seriously the UK views control over critical infrastructure. Physically destroying the site would have stopped services and wiped forensic evidence, yet it underscores the depth of concern about potential foreign control of national assets”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grjk83/"&gt;Gavin Knapp&lt;/a&gt;, cyber threat intelligence lead at &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bridewell, a supplier to the UK government critical network infrastructure, endorsed the severity of this approach. He said, “it’s like when a device is compromised, the only way to truly be sure there are no remnants, or unidentified backdoors is to restore the asset to a known good state. In the physical realm, in particular a data centre, to sweep and verify there is no enduring threat actor / spy presence is much more difficult, and at a state secrets level the required effort to treat or terminate the risk requires a huge amount of effort and cost to bring risks down to an acceptable level.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it’s not clear exactly how the data hub had been compromised, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinariley/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Martin Riley&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Bridewell, said, “The main point of entry may have been a VPN, as is common with Chinese actors, but if they have already moved across the environment and escalated privileges, then the impact would be wider.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Riley noted that when the government said it had discovered another way to protect the data, it was likely that it had patched a vulnerability “after performing incident response to understand the breadth of the breach and how it was initially accessed.”                                                                                                                    &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="organizations-cant-ignore-the-supply-chain"&gt;Organizations can’t ignore the supply chain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the constant threat from state-backed attackers, organizations everywhere need to be on constant alert, said Knapp, adding, “CISOs across government must assume they’re already being targeted, particularly by state-linked advanced persistent threats (APTs). These groups are difficult to detect because they prioritize stealth and long-term access over disruption. This raises key questions around how well organizations detect insider threats and hunt for compromises on edge devices, especially where vendors manage the hardware, making forensics more complex.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knapp warned that it was not sufficient to make government infrastructure more secure while ignoring the supply chain. “Even the most secure networks can be breached when attackers exploit users, contractors, or third-party systems to gain a foothold. They often compromise edge devices or exploit misconfigurations to move laterally within environments,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Remember, state-backed attackers play a long game, embedding themselves within critical networks for months or years,” he said. “Techniques such as &lt;a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/post/an-introduction-to-operational-relay-box-orb-networks-unpatched-forgotten-and-obscured" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Operational Relay Boxes&lt;/a&gt; (ORBs) allow them to mask their activity and bypass endpoint detection tools, making attribution extremely difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Between 1 and 2 October, the Colombian Police (Policia Nacional de Colombia) and the Spanish Guardia Civil, supported by Europol, targeted five key suspects, linked to the so-called Clan del Golfo, allegedly responsible for whole-sale cocaine trafficking operations from South America to Europe. In particular, the criminal network oversaw first-hand the production, transportation and distribution of cocaine throughout the entire logistics chains. To support field activities on the action day, Europol deployed two experts to Colombia and Spain.</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>Network security devices endanger orgs with ’90s era flaws</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074945/network-security-devices-endanger-orgs-with-90s-era-flaws.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have long relied on firewalls, routers, VPN servers, and email gateways to protect their networks from attacks. Increasingly, however, these network edge devices are becoming security liabilities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every few weeks, another crisis plays out: Security teams scramble to patch and scan their network appliances for malware implants after another zero-day attack is newly reported. Vendors emphasize that sophisticated nation-state actors carry out these attacks, but critics question why the basic flaws being exploited — buffer overflows, command injections, SQL injections — remain prevalent in mission-critical codebases maintained by companies whose core business is cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers constantly evolve their techniques. Security engineering, inherently challenging, can’t fix everything. All software products have vulnerabilities, even security tools. These would be valid responses if we were dealing with complex flaws, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-harris-sg/"&gt;Benjamin Harris&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of cybersecurity and penetration testing firm watchTowr. “But these are vulnerability classes from the 1990s, and security controls to prevent or identify them have existed for a long time. There is really no excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="network-edge-devices-the-new-battleground"&gt;Network edge devices: The new battleground&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google’s Threat Intelligence Group &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3973769/enterprise-specific-zero-day-exploits-on-the-rise-google-warns.html"&gt;tracked 75 exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly one in three targeted network and security appliances, a strikingly high rate given the range of IT systems attackers could choose to exploit. That trend has continued this year, with similar numbers in the first 10 months of 2025, targeting vendors such as Citrix NetScaler, Ivanti, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, SonicWall, and Juniper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Network edge devices are attractive targets because they are remotely accessible, fall outside endpoint protection monitoring, contain privileged credentials for lateral movement, and are not integrated into centralized logging solutions. Yet researchers have reported vulnerabilities in these systems for over a decade with little attacker interest beyond isolated incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That shifted over the past few years with a rapid surge in attacks, making compromised network edge devices one of the top initial access vectors into enterprise networks for state-affiliated cyberespionage groups and ransomware gangs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this shift, as organizations rapidly expanded remote access capabilities by deploying more VPN gateways, firewalls, and secure web and email gateways to accommodate work-from-home mandates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The declining success rate of phishing is another factor. Once the top initial access vector, phishing has become less effective thanks to defense efforts over the past 10 years. For 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970097/the-state-of-intrusions-stolen-credentials-and-perimeter-exploits-on-the-rise-as-phishing-wanes.html"&gt;Mandiant reported that 33% of intrusions resulted from exploits&lt;/a&gt;, 16% from stolen or weak credentials, and only 14% from phishing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Attackers are not trying to do the newest and greatest thing every single day,” watchTowr’s Harris explains. “They will do what works at scale. And we’ve now just seen that phishing has become objectively too expensive or too unsuccessful at scale to justify the time investment in deploying mailing infrastructure, getting domains and sender protocols in place, finding ways to bypass EDR, AV, sandboxes, mail filters, etc. It is now easier to find a 1990s-tier vulnerability in a border device where EDR typically isn’t deployed, exploit that, and then pivot from there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that attack campaigns against network-edge devices are becoming more visible to security teams because they are looking into what’s happening on these appliances more than they did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ten years ago, I was professionally doing exploit development for these types of routers,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-baines-1490a7189/"&gt;Jacob Baines&lt;/a&gt;, CTO and head of research at vulnerability intelligence company VulnCheck, tells CSO. “I know there were many groups that were interested in it, but the security industry itself was more interested in desktop endpoints. And I think the industry has gotten better at protecting those types of endpoints. They’ve gotten better at protecting against phishing, so this is the next area that we’re trying to improve upon. So, there are a lot more eyes on it from the security field, but not necessarily attackers. I think they’ve always been there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="basic-flaws-persist-in-network-device-codebases"&gt;Basic flaws persist in network device codebases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harris of watchTowr doesn’t want to minimize the engineering effort it takes to build a secure system. But he feels many of the vulnerabilities discovered in the past two years should have been caught with automatic code analysis tools or code reviews, given how basic they have been.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some VPN flaws were “trivial to the point of embarrassing for the vendor,” he says, while even the complex ones should have been caught by any organization seriously investing in product security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, despite the basic nature of some of these vulnerabilities, most do not directly allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands on the underlying OS with root privileges. Instead, attackers often must find and chain together vulnerabilities across multiple components, requiring them to understand how those components interact and identify a path to remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t necessarily call them complex exploit chains, but I think it’s a little unfair to call them simple as well,” VulnCheck’s Baines says. “Something like a Cisco ASA router or a PAN-OS system are very complicated systems. It takes a lot of knowledge of those systems to be able to write code in them and identify bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bishopfox.com/authors/caleb-gross"&gt;Caleb Gross&lt;/a&gt;, director of capability development at offensive security firm Bishop Fox, also notes the reverse-engineering skill required to find these bugs, as firmware images for these devices aren’t readily available, like open-source applications, and their file systems are often encrypted. Even after decryption, researchers or attackers must then learn how various components communicate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identifying a command injection that is looking for a command string being passed to a system in some C or C++ code is not a terribly difficult thing to find,” Gross says. “But I think the trouble is understanding a really complicated appliance like these security network appliances. It’s not just like a single web application and that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This can also make it difficult for product developers themselves to understand the risks of a feature they add on one component if they don’t have a full understanding of the entire product architecture. In large product organizations, it’s not unusual for different development teams to handle different codebases for different parts of one product’s system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Harris offers a counterargument: The product security team only has to recognize a code bug with potential security implications and fix it. They don’t have to develop a working exploit, like an attacker does.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a product security team, your job is not really exploitation, like getting a shell,” he says. “Your aim is to work out how many of these vulnerabilities that you identify are exploitable. Can you remove the low-hanging fruit — the things that are trivial that someone is going to find — and then you can invest your efforts in finding more and more complex things.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harris adds: “In our opinion, again, looking at what we’ve seen the last 12 months, there’s no evidence that those efforts being made by those vendors are having an effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-debt-and-prioritization-challenges"&gt;Security debt and prioritization challenges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another problem? These appliances have a lot of legacy code, some that is 10 years or older. Plus, products and code bases inherited through acquisitions often means the developers who originally wrote the code might be long gone. For example, Ivanti, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3954735/ivanti-warns-customers-of-new-critical-flaw-exploited-in-the-wild.html"&gt;more frequently targeted vendors&lt;/a&gt; over the past two years, acquired Pulse Secure in 2020, and the Pulse Connect Secure SSL VPN has since become &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3652369/ivanti-warns-critical-rce-flaw-in-connect-secure-exploited-as-zero-day.html"&gt;Ivanti Connect Secure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.veracode.com/leadership/chris-wysopal/"&gt;Chris Wysopal&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and chief security evangelist at application security testing company Veracode, tackling vulnerabilities in old code, known as security debt, is expensive and hard. And developers are more reluctant to fix certain issues, particularly those in C and C++ code, such as buffer and integer overflows, due to concern that they might break something they don’t fully understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a modern process of application security testing and flaws are detected soon after code is written, the developer can go in and fix it,” Wysopal says. “But when you’re dealing with legacy code — we’ve actually seen some C++ applications where you have literally thousands of overflow issues and the original developers are long gone — it’s very difficult to get a new developer to look at it, and they don’t really want to touch the code. They get to a point where it’s like: Well, prove to me it’s exploitable, because this is a critical old piece of code that no one understands and it’s dangerous to touch it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, some flaws require more proof of impact than others, and proving that a buffer overflow can result in arbitrary code execution is not straightforward; it requires also bypassing exploit mitigations on the OS, such as ASLR, which randomizes memory addresses. Command injection issues, on the other hand, are much easier to fix, according to Wysopal, even in old code bases. Then authorization bypasses usually require manual penetration testing to find.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Each one of these flaw categories is a little different and this is why application security is hard,” he says. “But these are all top 10 issues. Things that these organizations should have a plan to say, ‘We’re going to eliminate the top 10 classes of vulnerabilities in our product.’ And it’s frankly just expensive and hard to do when you have big legacy code bases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vendors-need-to-set-a-higher-standard-for-themselves"&gt;Vendors need to set a higher standard for themselves&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All researchers interviewed for this story agree that manufacturers of security appliances need to do a better job when it comes to their secure development lifecycle programs, internal application security testing, code reviews, and legacy code rewrites. Some, however, don’t have much hope for things to change because financial incentives to do so are missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rewriting old code to be secure by design requires a lot of development time. Even fixing all the bugs that static and dynamic scanners find can incur budgetary challenges, resulting in the need to prioritize some over others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But security vendors need to be held to a higher standard because they sell products marketed to protect banks, government agencies, and critical infrastructure. They shouldn’t become a liability for customers, or in Harris’ words: “Are we expecting APT [Advanced Persistent Threat] groups to be our internal QA teams?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wysopal pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form"&gt;the Secure Software Development Attestation Form&lt;/a&gt; that the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) launched last year and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;its Secure by Design principles&lt;/a&gt; as a step in the right direction. The CISA program &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3971375/secure-by-design-is-likely-dead-at-cisa-will-the-private-sector-make-good-on-its-pledge.html"&gt;has seen some setbacks&lt;/a&gt; with two of the program’s architects and leaders, Lauren Zabierek and Bob Lord, leaving CISA in April amid staff and budget cuts. But it wouldn’t be surprising if other governments enacted legislation in the future to force the market’s hand. “I would be shocked if there’s not a conversation about regulation ongoing after the number of breaches we’ve now seen across fairly critical industries due to vulnerabilities in appliances that are mission-critical repeatedly, and then the root cause being questionable,” watchTowr’s Harris says. “It’s really now a race to see: Will enterprises vote with their wallets and their budgets, or will regulation come in first to help us begin to deal with this? But either way, something must change.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class="sidebar"&gt;  
&lt;h3 id="vendor-efforts-to-stem-the-tide-on-network-edge-exploitation"&gt;Vendor efforts to stem the tide on network edge exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Vendors who responded to questions for this story all said they take secure development lifecycle practices seriously and are making investments in architectural changes, including rewriting legacy code. For example, Palo Alto Networks pointed to its implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux"&gt;Security-Enhanced Linux&lt;/a&gt; (SELinux) in full enforcement mode and &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-use-linux-kernels-integrity-measurement-architecture"&gt;Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)&lt;/a&gt; in PAN-OS as examples of platform security hardening to mitigate entire classes of threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Ganas, director of the Deep Product Security Research Team at Palo Alto’s network security division, told CSO that his team has tripled in size and has no budgetary constraints or other barriers for evolving the code base of the 20-year-old PAN-OS into a more secure architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that his team was created to investigate the root causes of bugs that tools and manual code reviews find and then to implement architectural changes to make exploitation of those flaws much harder. Often that means simplifying the architecture to make security boundaries — and the interactions between them — much clearer. That way, developers are better equipped to write secure code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a very long history of responsibly processing, remediating, disclosing vulnerabilities, but ultimately with how the threat landscape evolved over the last few years, there is this absolute need for us to go deeper into our products and ultimately find and address all of these architectural issues,” Ganas said. “We acknowledge the scale of exploitation across all vendors, but from our perspective, we fundamentally need to lead our industry and acknowledge that customers trust us with their security. We are offering them a security platform. We are ultimately protecting their network. We have to put ourselves to the highest standard of product security and operational excellence around these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivanti, whose security products were the target of multiple zero-day exploits by APT groups over the past two years, has also &lt;a href="https://www.ivanti.com/resources/secure-by-design/2024"&gt;signed the CISA Secure by Design pledge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ivanti.com/blog/from-legacy-to-security-ivanti-connect-secure"&gt;is making architectural changes and tackling the technical debt&lt;/a&gt; that has accumulated over decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The current threat landscape for edge devices is aggressive and sophisticated, and no company has been proven immune,” an Ivanti spokesperson told CSO. “[…] Recognizing meaningful advances don’t happen overnight, we committed to putting in the time and financial investment, including rearchitecting legacy products, embedding security throughout the development lifecycle, and anticipating potential adversary misuse across our planning process. We have not hesitated to touch older code as part of this effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Software Group, which owns NetScaler (aka Citrix NetScaler), has also signed &lt;a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2025/04/02/citrixs-approach-to-secure-by-design/"&gt;the CISA Secure by Design pledge&lt;/a&gt; and told CSO that it has embedded secure development methodologies throughout its engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At Cloud Software Group, we take security seriously,” the company said. “We have published our approach to security, including &lt;a href="https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/about/cloud-software-group-secure-development-lifecycle-for-citrix-and-netscaler-products-and-services.pdf"&gt;our secure development lifecycle (SDLC) process&lt;/a&gt;. Our dedicated Product Security Team, which serves as the cornerstone of this commitment, regularly reviews process improvements and is responsible for a comprehensive set of proactive and reactive security activities throughout the product lifecycle.” These include proactive vulnerability identification, implementation of strong security controls, driving secure development practices and product incident response management.” &lt;em&gt;— LC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Foreign hackers breached a US nuclear weapons plant via SharePoint flaws</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074962/foreign-hackers-breached-a-us-nuclear-weapons-plant-via-sharepoint-flaws.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A foreign threat actor infiltrated the &lt;a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/"&gt;Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC)&lt;/a&gt;, a key manufacturing site within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), exploiting unpatched Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to a source involved in an August incident response at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach targeted a plant that produces the vast majority of critical non-nuclear components for US nuclear weapons under the NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) that oversees the design, production, and maintenance of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp;amp; Technologies (FM&amp;amp;T) manages the Kansas City campus under contract to the NNSA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City campus, Honeywell FM&amp;amp;T, and the Department of Energy did not respond to repeated requests for comment throughout September, well before the current government shutdown. NSA public affairs officer Eddie Bennett did respond, saying, “We have nothing to contribute,” and referred CSO back to the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it is unclear whether the attackers were a Chinese nation-state actor or Russian cybercriminals — the two most likely culprits — experts say the incident drives home the importance of securing systems that protect operational technology from exploits that primarily affect IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-breach-unfolded"&gt;How the breach unfolded&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers exploited &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025691/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-breach-hits-on-prem-servers.html"&gt;two recently disclosed Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; — CVE-2025-53770, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution (RCE) bug — both affecting on-premises servers. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/"&gt;issued fixes&lt;/a&gt; for the vulnerabilities on July 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On July 22, the NNSA &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/us-nuclear-weapons-agency-breached-in-microsoft-sharepoint-hack"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was one of the organizations hit by attacks enabled by the SharePoint flaws. “On Friday, July 18th, the exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint zero-day vulnerability began affecting the Department of Energy,” a DOE spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the DOE contended at the time, “The department was minimally impacted due to its widespread use of the Microsoft M365 cloud and very capable cybersecurity systems. A very small number of systems were impacted. All impacted systems are being restored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early August, federal responders, including personnel from the NSA, were on-site at the Kansas City facility, the source tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Located in Missouri, the &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/ea/kansas-city-national-security-campus"&gt;KCNSC manufactures&lt;/a&gt; non-nuclear mechanical, electronic, and engineered material components used in US nuclear defense systems. It also provides specialized technical services, including metallurgical analysis, analytical chemistry, environmental testing, and simulation modeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roughly 80% of the non-nuclear parts in the nation’s nuclear stockpile &lt;a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/about-us/overview/"&gt;originate from KCNSC&lt;/a&gt;. While most design and programmatic details remain classified, the plant’s production role makes it one of the most sensitive facilities in the federal weapons complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="china-or-russia-conflicting-attribution"&gt;China or Russia? Conflicting attribution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/#storm-2603"&gt;attributed the broader wave of SharePoint exploitations&lt;/a&gt; to three Chinese-linked groups: Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and a third actor it tracks as Storm-2603. The company said the attackers were preparing to deploy Warlock ransomware across affected systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the source familiar with the Kansas City incident tells CSO that a Russian threat actor, not a Chinese one, was responsible for the intrusion. Cybersecurity company Resecurity, which was monitoring the SharePoint exploitations, tells CSO that its own data pointed primarily to Chinese nation-state groups, but it does not rule out Russian involvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resecurity’s researchers say that while Chinese groups appeared to have developed and deployed the initial zero-day, financially motivated Russian actors may have independently reproduced the exploit before technical details began circulating in late June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May, researchers at Viettel Cyber Security &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-exploited-in-rce-attacks-no-patch-available/"&gt;demonstrated an attack chaining two SharePoint flaws&lt;/a&gt;, CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704, at Pwn2Own Berlin. Resecurity researchers tell CSO that those demonstrations likely accelerated the reverse-engineering of the vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resecurity’s analysts observed early-stage scanning and exploitation activity from infrastructure located in Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, and Hong Kong, a distribution pattern consistent with tactics used by Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to disguise attribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The root cause of the SharePoint exploitation is closely related to misuse of the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) by China,” Resecurity researchers tell CSO. “The most probable perpetrators are Chinese nation-state actors such as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, they say that yet another way that Russia-based threat actors could have acquired knowledge of the vulnerability early on was through underground exchanges or by analyzing network scanning data once the exploit became known. The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4027971/microsofts-incomplete-sharepoint-patch-led-to-global-exploits-by-china-linked-hackers.html"&gt;transition from zero-day to N-day status&lt;/a&gt;, they say, opened a window for secondary actors to exploit systems that had not yet applied the patches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="could-the-attack-have-reached-operational-systems"&gt;Could the attack have reached operational systems?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach targeted the IT side of the Kansas City campus, but the intrusion raises the question of whether attackers could have moved laterally into the facility’s operational technology (OT) systems, the manufacturing and process control environments that directly support weapons component production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OT cybersecurity specialists interviewed by CSO say that KCNSC’s production systems are likely air-gapped or otherwise isolated from corporate IT networks, significantly reducing the risk of direct crossover. Nevertheless, they caution against assuming such isolation guarantees safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have to really consider and think through how state actors potentially exploit IT vulnerabilities to gain access to that operational technology,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jensovada/"&gt;Jen Sovada&lt;/a&gt;, general manager of public sector operations at Claroty, speaking generally and not about the specific incident, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you have a facility like the KCNSC where they do nuclear weapons lifecycle management — design, manufacturing, emergency response, decommissioning, supply chain management — there are multiple interconnected functions,” Sovada says. “If an actor can move laterally, they could impact programmable logic controllers that run robotics or precision assembly equipment for non-nuclear weapon components.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such access, Sovada adds, could also affect distribution control systems that oversee quality assurance, or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that manage utilities, power, and environmental controls. “It’s broader than just an IT vulnerability,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-ot-convergence-and-the-zero-trust-gap"&gt;IT/OT convergence and the zero-trust gap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City incident highlights a systemic problem across the federal enterprise: the disconnect between IT and OT security practices. While the federal government has advanced its zero-trust roadmap for traditional IT networks, similar frameworks for operational environments have lagged, although recent developments point to progress on that front.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s an &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/deploy/networks"&gt;IT fan chart&lt;/a&gt; that maps all of the controls for zero trust, segmentation, authentication, and identity management,” Sovada says. “But there’s also an &lt;a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/dod-official-sees-new-zero-trust-ot-iot-guidance-in-september/#:~:text=The%20DoD%20official%20also%20provided,OT%20%E2%80%9Clikely%20around%20August.%E2%80%9D"&gt;OT fan chart&lt;/a&gt; being developed by the Department of Defense that will define comparable controls for zero trust in operational technology. The goal is to marry the two, so that zero trust becomes comprehensive across all network types.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That alignment, she says, is essential to preventing intrusions like the one that struck KCNSC from cascading into physical operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="even-non-classified-data-theft-holds-strategic-value"&gt;Even non-classified data theft holds strategic value&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the source’s claim of Russian involvement is accurate, the attackers may have been financially motivated ransomware operators rather than state intelligence services. But even in that scenario, the data they accessed could still carry strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would make sense that if it were a ransomware actor and they got this kind of data about nuclear weapons manufacturing, they might pause and hand it off to the appropriate Russian government officials or experts,” Sovada tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that classified information was compromised, even unclassified technical data can have significant implications. “It could be something as simple as requirements documents that may not be classified but reveal the level of precision required for components,” Sovada says. “In weapons manufacturing, a millimeter difference can change a device’s trajectory or the reliability of its arming mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such information could aid adversaries in understanding US weapons tolerances, supply chain dependencies, or manufacturing processes, all of which are sensitive even if not formally secret.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether the intruders were Chinese state actors or Russian cybercriminals, the Kansas City breach exposes the fragile intersection of IT and operational security across critical defense infrastructure. As Sovada stresses, “We can’t just think of zero trust as an IT concept anymore. It has to extend into the physical systems that underpin national defense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
