      <title>Always-on privileged access is pervasive — and fraught with risks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123184/always-on-privileged-access-is-pervasive-and-fraught-with-risks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Privileged access management (PAM) has always been about ensuring least privilege. But the nature of enterprise cybersecurity — on top of the complexity of system operations — has prompted far too many users to log in at the highest possible privilege and stay there, even when most of their tasks do not require it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114758/enterprises-still-arent-getting-iam-right-2.html"&gt;One recent study&lt;/a&gt; put the percentage of end-users logging in at their highest level of privilege at 91%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://greyhoundresearch.com/svg/"&gt;Sanchit Vir Gogia&lt;/a&gt;, chief analyst at Greyhound Research, sees the widespread use of unnecessarily high privileges as the result of years of enterprise tech governance neglect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises are running complex, interdependent technology estates where privileged access underpins stability, recovery, and continuity,” he says. “In many environments, privileged access was granted years ago to support systems that no longer have clear owners, clean documentation, or modern authentication paths. That access now props up integrations, batch jobs, recovery scripts, vendor tooling, and fragile automation chains.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Gogia sees enterprises maintaining this status quo on privileges because reining it in “feels less like tightening security and more like introducing existential operational risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are choosing predictability over disruption,” he explains. “Always-on privilege becomes the safest option in environments where architectural certainty no longer exists. It accumulates quietly over time as systems evolve faster than governance models. Mergers, cloud migrations, outsourcing, platform layering, and emergency fixes all leave behind privileged identities that nobody revisits. Over years, this creates an estate where privilege is deeply embedded into how work gets done.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of that complexity, Gogia says, always-on becomes not just the easiest tactic, but the default one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises often fall back to permanent privilege because it works,” he says. “It keeps pipelines running, integrations stable, and systems responsive. Vaulting credentials does not solve the problem if those credentials never expire. Zero trust principles are sound, but their implementation frequently assumes a cleanliness that enterprise estates simply do not have. This mismatch explains why many organizations buy &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/572787/7-top-privileged-access-management-tools.html"&gt;PAM tools&lt;/a&gt;, deploy them partially, and quietly allow exceptions to proliferate until the exception becomes the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, PAM — and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/518296/what-is-iam-identity-and-access-management-explained.html"&gt;identity access management (IAM)&lt;/a&gt; — has become misaligned with how modern enterprise systems operate, Gogia says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many tools still assume relatively static infrastructure, limited identity volumes, and manual intervention points,” he notes. “Modern enterprises operate dynamic, ephemeral environments where workloads spin up and down constantly, identities are created programmatically, and access requirements change in real-time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-perils-of-persistent-privilege"&gt;The perils of persistent privilege&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/team/robert-kramer/"&gt;Robert Kramer&lt;/a&gt;, vice president and principal analyst for Moor Insights &amp;amp; Strategy, agrees that excessive credentials are caused by decades of lax IT governance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are stuck in legacy habits, stuck in their legacy operational ways,” Kramer says. “There should be a shift to more of a just-in-time model. Barely 1% of organizations have implemented that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The executive overseeing the 91% report — &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleshchu/"&gt;Charles Chu&lt;/a&gt;, general manager for IT and developer products at CyberArk — said staying logged in at the highest level certainly has a cybersecurity risk, but it also introduces the IT risk of massive system damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An accidental typo, for example, could cause massive damage if the typist is logged in at the highest level, Chu contends. “I could fat finger something and delete it by accident. Is it really so onerous to log in or out of something?” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That last question is not rhetorical. Chu suggests that some PAM packages are indeed too difficult to use, therefore causing user friction. “If the PAM tool itself is onerous to use, [end-users] will find ways to bypass it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kunkleconsulting.net/owner"&gt;JR Kunkle&lt;/a&gt;, president of Kunkle Consulting and former risk consultant with Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche, agrees about the typo risk. “Most interruptions in computers are due to errors or mistakes,” he says. “IT staff using an admin-level [privilege] can cause a production outage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Kunkle, who also worked as an IT manager with Limited Brands and Honda, says defaulting to high privilege access can also undermine legal, compliance, and privacy efforts. “If the admin looks at sensitive data [that the admin was not supposed to see], it’s pretty easy for them to cover their tracks by erasing the access logs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most observers, however, put the blame of excessive credentials on IT pros themselves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is negating the controls that they have put in place. You could take down an entire company through carelessness or fat-fingering,” says &lt;a href="https://acceligence.com/talent/profiles/justin-greis/"&gt;Justin Greis&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of consulting firm Acceligence and former head of the North American cybersecurity practice at McKinsey. “It’s just human nature to take the easy road” and cut corners when it comes to privileged access. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.digicert.com/blog/author/jason-sabin"&gt;Jason Sabin&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at DigiCert, is more blunt: “If an enterprise [IT worker] uses root, they are an idiot. You can screw up your world. You should never use root. Embrace least privilege. You should never use elevated privileges for ordinary mundane tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="paradigm-shift-ahead"&gt;Paradigm shift ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forrester analyst &lt;a href="https://www.forrester.com/analyst-bio/geoff-cairns/BIO20052"&gt;Geoff Cairns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3952041/malicious-actors-increasingly-put-privileged-identity-access-to-work-across-attack-chains.html"&gt;stresses the cybersecurity risks at play&lt;/a&gt; when organizations do not rein in excessive credential use. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Persistent standing privilege, yes, I think that is rampant,” he says. “It is something that attackers can target and then leverage to move laterally through systems and create havoc. The elevated privilege makes that all the more impactful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet Cairns sees the hard road ahead in tackling this issue in modern enterprise environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a challenging problem to solve in a very complex IT landscape, with on-prem, cloud, SaaS” and it is going to get exponentially worse with “the explosion of non-human identities,” including autonomous agents, Cairns says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greyhound Research’s Gogia agrees that non-human identities (NHIs) are going to make the problem of excess credential use far worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The center of gravity has shifted away from human administrators. The most dangerous and least governed privilege now sits with non-human identities. Service accounts, APIs, cloud roles, CI/CD pipelines, SaaS connectors, automation frameworks, and autonomous systems operate continuously with standing access,” he says. “These identities authenticate programmatically, at machine speed, often across environments, and frequently with broader permissions than any individual would ever be granted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the increasing proliferation of NHIs engaging with enterprise systems is pushing PAM and IAM toward a paradigm shift.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Traditional PAM and IAM models were designed for humans who log in, perform tasks, and log out. They struggle when identities never log out,” Gogia says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Machine privilege is not an edge case,” he adds. “It is the majority case in modern environments. Enterprises attempting to apply human-style access reviews and approval workflows to these identities quickly discover that governance collapses under scale. This is where always-on privilege stops being a failure of discipline and becomes a failure of design assumptions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Sicarii ransomware locks your data and throws away the keys</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123492/sicarii-ransomware-locks-your-data-and-throws-away-the-keys.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A newly observed Sicarii ransomware strain contains a critical encryption key handling defect that can leave encrypted data unrecoverable, even if a victim pays the ransom or uses a provided decryptor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysts at the Halcyon Ransomware Research Center found that Sicarii generates fresh &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3995036/breaking-rsa-encryption-just-got-20x-easier-for-quantum-computers.html"&gt;RSA key&lt;/a&gt; pairs for each execution and then discards the private key, leaving no recoverable key material for the encrypted systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations affected by this variant cannot rely on ransom negotiation or third-party decryptors to restore files unless there is evidence that the underlying flaw has been fixed in the specific sample that infected them. “The issue appears to stem from poor encryption key management rather than deliberate design,” said Sakshi Grover, senior research manager, cybersecurity at IDC. “This reflects a broader trend in the ransomware ecosystem, where low barriers to entry and rapid monetization take precedence over technical robustness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicarii was first disclosed in December 2025, and has only a small track record of claimed victims, but its unusual technical attributes have forced researchers to claim it could have been &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053635/when-ai-nukes-your-database-the-dark-side-of-vibe-coding.html"&gt;vibe coded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Encryption defect breaks standard RaaS model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware typically encrypts files using a public-key &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/565965/preparing-for-the-day-quantum-computing-cracks-public-key-cryptography-what-to-do-now.html"&gt;scheme&lt;/a&gt; where the attacker retains the private key or can regenerate it later, enabling a decryptor to work if the ransom is paid. Sicarii deviates from this model. In Halcyon observed samples, it generates a new RSA key pair entirely on the victim system during each execution and immediately discards the private key once encryption completes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The victims end up with no viable path to recover encrypted data, even if they cooperate with attackers or use a published decryptor tool. According to a Halcyon &lt;a href="https://www.halcyon.ai/ransomware-alerts/alert-sicarii-ransomware-encryption-key-handling-defect"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt;, enterprises should assume failed recovery through ransom-related decryptors unless there is independent verification that the defect was eliminated in that strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A Sicarii ransomware represents a nightmare scenario where traditional ransomware response strategies fail entirely,” said Agnidipta Sarkar, chief evangelist at ColorTokens. “As no decryptor can reconstruct the discarded private keys, enterprises will stare at ‘assume total data destruction,’ amplifying financial, operational, and reputational damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Absence of a decryptor-based recovery forces organizations to plan for complete recovery through backups and alternate operational restoration methods, changing the cost-benefit analysis for them. This also heightens the importance of pre-existing, secure backup infrastructure and rapid isolation. Halcyon urged organizations to focus on immediate containment and restoration rather than ransom-based recovery. Affected systems should be isolated, the scope of infection identified, and operations restored only from known-good, offline, or immutable backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Enterprises must invest in proactive zero trust micro-segmentation that is designed to be adopted in hours, leveraging existing EDR, agents, agentless mechanisms to contain threats at the initial access point, preventing encryption from spreading,” Sarkar added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Unusual technical profile hints at vibe-coding&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation for Sicarii’s broken encryption flow is immature or poorly implemented development practices. The ransomware’s failure to retain usable keys is inconsistent with established ransomware design and suggests it may have been assembled without rigorous testing or a clear understanding of operational consequences, or even vibe-coded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Halcyon assesses with moderate confidence that the developers may have used AI-assisted tooling, which could have contributed to this implementation error,” the researchers said in the alert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Check Point Research’s &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/sicarii-ransomware-truth-vs-myth/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month had also highlighted a set of unusual and internally inconsistent characteristics. According to the analysis, Sicarri incorporates Israeli and Jewish activity symbolism in its branding and messaging, yet much of its underground activity appears in Russian. Also, the Hebrew language used in the malware and communications contains errors indicative of non-native or automated translation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond encryption, Check Point observed Sicarii performing credential harvesting, network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and data exfiltration, indicating the operation includes tooling atypical to financially motivated ransomware. “Sicarii significantly raises the risk profile of ransomware incidents, shifting the impact from financial extortion to potential permanent data loss and prolonged business disruption,” Grover added. “In regulated industries, this can further escalate compliance, legal, and operational consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Palo Alto unveils Quantum-Safe Security to mitigate cryptographic risk</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123719/palo-alto-warns-of-quantum-risk-to-digital-security.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks unveiled its Quantum-Safe Security solution at the company’s virtual Quantum-Safe Summit Tuesday. The solution is designed to help organizations prepare for the post-quantum era by addressing the transition from current cryptography to quantum-resistant algorithms without disrupting business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the platform’s key features is its continuous, real-time cryptographic visibility. Quantum-Safe acts as a central intelligence layer, collecting telemetry and logs from network infrastructure — such as PAN-OS NGFW and Prisma Access — and enriching them with data from an ecosystem of third-party security tools, according to the company. The feature enables the discovery and cataloging of applications, systems, infrastructure, and IoT devices, and it facilitates analysis of cryptographic traffic behavior, including protocols, encryption algorithms, key exchange mechanisms, certificates, and libraries used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the summit, Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora stressed that quantum computing is reaching a turning point similar to that of artificial intelligence. “It’s no longer a laboratory project, and its ability to solve problems at high speed is approaching production environments,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Arora and other technology experts, the technology poses a critical security challenge. “Quantum computers will be able to break cryptographic keys much faster than current systems, putting everything from private communications to digital assets like Bitcoin at risk,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to the threat of “harvest now, decrypt later” techniques,  in which encrypted data collected today could be decrypted more readily in the future with quantum computing, urgency to address post-quantum cryptography is rising.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Regulators and companies are already demanding quantum transition plans to protect critical infrastructure and ensure operational continuity,” Arora said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To that end, Palo Alto’s Quantum-Safe Security solution offers advanced cryptographic risk assessment and prioritization, correlating encryption strength with business criticality and data lifecycle. This identifies immediate exposures (“harvest now, decrypt later” risks) and high-value assets requiring priority migration, providing security teams with a clear, impact-based roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key feature is its remediation approach, which guides the transition in several stages. The solution helps modernize infrastructures to achieve a “quantum ready” state, activate post-quantum or hybrid (quantum-safe) algorithms, and, in the case of legacy systems or devices that cannot be upgraded, apply virtual patching through encryption translation. This mechanism enables vulnerable traffic to be re-encrypted in real-time with secure quantum standards, without modifying existing applications or code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quantum-Safe Security also incorporates a robust governance and ongoing compliance framework. It automates crypto hygiene management, maintains a dynamic cryptographic inventory (CBOM), and detects deviations or the use of weak ciphers in real-time. Furthermore, it facilitates regulatory compliance through automated reporting and audits aligned with global standards and regulations such as NIST, FIPS 140-3, and DORA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution is designed to integrate with existing security and operations systems, including SIEM, EDR, load balancers, and vulnerability management tools, enabling a scalable, gradual transition compatible with complex business environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Waiting for the hardware to be available to act could leave critical systems years behind, with serious risks to security and operational continuity,” Arora noted at the event. “The ability to break cryptography will force companies, governments, and regulators to anticipate, adapt, and protect critical data before this technology becomes fully operational. Those who act proactively will be able to mitigate risks and ensure business continuity in the new quantum era,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Firm stand against migrant smuggling: global alliance convened in Brussels</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/firm-stand-against-migrant-smuggling-global-alliance-convened-in-brussels</link>
      <description>On 10 December 2025, Europol participated in the second International Conference of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, hosted by the European Commission. Over 80 delegations, including EU Member States, EU agencies, third party countries, international organisations, and private parties attended the event. During this high-level conference, over 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen cooperation along migrant smuggling routes and tackle the growing digital dimension of these criminal activities. The declaration underscores new preventive measures, including a crackdown on online advertisements promoting migrant smuggling and the disruption of underground banking systems fuelling the criminal business.</description>

      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>NIST’s AI guidance pushes cybersecurity boundaries</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123196/nists-ai-guidance-pushes-cybersecurity-boundaries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, US cybersecurity guidance rested on a reassuring premise: New technologies introduce new wrinkles, but not fundamentally new problems. Artificial intelligence, according to that view, is still software, just faster, more complex, and more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The controls that protect traditional systems, the thinking went, can largely be adapted to protect AI, too. That assumption surfaced at a recent National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &lt;a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/get-involved/attend-events/cyber-ai-workshop-2"&gt;workshop on AI and cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI systems in many ways are just smart software, fancy software with a little bit extra,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriayanpillitteri/"&gt;Victoria Pillitteri&lt;/a&gt;, supervisory computer scientist in the Computer Security Division at NIST, told attendees as she summarized that long-standing view. “That means we can leverage the robust body of [cybersecurity] knowledge that already exists with some modifications, with some considerations, but we do not and should not start from scratch,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as discussions during the event turned to AI agents and adversarial manipulation, that concept began to fray. Experts described ways in which AI strains the fundamental assumptions those frameworks rely on, namely that systems behave deterministically, that boundaries between components are stable, and that humans remain firmly in control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those concerns are now moving beyond internal discussion and into public standards development. On Jan. 8, NIST’s Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI) issued a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2026-00206.pdf"&gt;formal Request for Information (RFI)&lt;/a&gt; on the secure practices and methodologies of AI agent systems, one of the most challenging aspects of AI &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089732/rethinking-identity-for-the-ai-era-cisos-must-build-trust-at-machine-speed.html"&gt;when it comes to identity management and cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RFI focuses on AI systems capable of taking autonomous actions that affect real-world environments and explicitly asks for input on novel risks, security practices, assessment methods, and deployment constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs, what should matter is that NIST is shifting from a broad, &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.600-1.pdf"&gt;principle-based AI risk management&lt;/a&gt; framework toward more operationally grounded expectations, especially for systems that act without constant human oversight. What is emerging across NIST’s AI-related cybersecurity work is a recognition that AI is no longer a distant or abstract governance issue, but a near-term security problem that the nation’s standards-setting body is trying to tackle in a multifaceted way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nists-wide-ranging-cybersecurity-and-ai-portfolio"&gt;NIST’s wide-ranging cybersecurity and AI portfolio&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the purpose of the workshop was to solicit feedback specifically on NIST’s preliminary Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Artificial Intelligence (&lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2025/NIST.IR.8596.iprd.pdf"&gt;Cyber AI Profile&lt;/a&gt;), which is an adaptation of the community profiles emerging from &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework"&gt;NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework&lt;/a&gt;, experts addressed many other NIST practices and methodology initiatives that deal with AI-related threats and security opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These efforts show how NIST is attacking AI security from multiple angles — development, deployment, identity, privacy, and adversarial abuse — and include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Risk Management Framework. &lt;/strong&gt;Released on Jan. 26, 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework"&gt;NIST’s AI RMF&lt;/a&gt; was developed to better manage risks to individuals, organizations, and society associated with AI. “What we’re trying to do with the AI Risk Management Framework is understand how we trust AI, which operates in many ways differently in some of these tasks that we know very well,” particularly regarding how high-impact applications affect cybersecurity, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcs729/"&gt;Martin Stanley&lt;/a&gt;, principal researcher for AI and cybersecurity at NIST, said at the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Center for AI Standards and Innovation (CAISI). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/caisi"&gt;NIST’s CAISI&lt;/a&gt; serves as the “industry’s primary point of contact within the US government to facilitate testing and collaborative research related to harnessing and securing the potential of commercial AI systems,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maiahamin/"&gt;Maia Hamin&lt;/a&gt;, a technical staff member of CAISI, the center that develops best practices and standards for improving AI security and collaboration. It also “leads evaluations and assessments of US and adversary AI systems, including adoption of foreign models, potential security vulnerabilities, or potential for foreign influence,” she told workshop attendees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST AI 100-2 E2025, Adversarial Machine Learning: A Taxonomy and Terminology of Attacks and Mitigations. &lt;/strong&gt;This &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ai/100/2/e2025/final"&gt;NIST report&lt;/a&gt;, published in March 2025,provides a taxonomy of concepts and defines terminology in the field of adversarial machine learning (AML). “Adversarial machine learning or adversarial AI is the field that studies attacks on AI systems that exploit the statistical and data-driven nature of this technology,” NIST research team supervisor &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avassilev/"&gt;Apostol Vassilev&lt;/a&gt; said at the workshop. “Hijacking, prompt injection, indirect prompt injection, data poisoning, all these things are part of the field of study of adversarial AI,” he clarified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dioptra. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pages.nist.gov/dioptra/"&gt;Dioptra&lt;/a&gt; is a NIST software test platform for assessing the trustworthy characteristics of AI. “You have multiple dimensions along which you want to analyze these as you want to identify how accurate they are for a particular task,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harold-booth-38ba4539/"&gt;Harold Booth&lt;/a&gt;, NIST supervisory computer scientist, said at the event. “You want to be able to identify how robust they are to various kinds of attacks,” Booth said. “You want to know how well they do against various kinds of data sets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST SP 800-218A, Secure Software Development Practices for Generative AI and Dual-Use Foundation Models: An SSDF Community Profile. &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-218A.pdf"&gt;AI SSDF community profile&lt;/a&gt; adds “practices, tasks, recommendations, considerations, notes, and informative references that are specific to AI model development throughout the software development life cycle.” NIST’s Booth told the workshop attendees, “This particular profile is very focused on what is new with respect to doing development for AI systems. So all the concerns that exist for normal software development still pertain. But what we were really focused on was what’s new.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PETs Testbed. &lt;/strong&gt;NIST’s &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/pets-testbed"&gt;PETs Testbed&lt;/a&gt; provides the capability to investigate privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and their respective suitability for specific use cases, helping organizations evaluate and manage privacy risks. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gshowarth/"&gt;Gary Howarth&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the privacy engineering program at NIST, said that within a few weeks, NIST will release a new version of its privacy framework that is complementary to AI risk management and cybersecurity threat modeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST Special Publication 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines. &lt;/strong&gt;NIST recently updated its 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/identity-access-management/projects/nist-special-publication-800-63-digital-identity-guidelines"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; on digital identity to better embrace the process and technical requirements for meeting digital identity assurance levels, given the rapid pace of digital technical change. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-galluzzo-a100563b/"&gt;Ryan Galluzzo&lt;/a&gt;, identity program lead for NIST Applied Cybersecurity Division, stressed at the workshop that “AI agents are starting to change the kind of context and conversation around traditional cybersecurity controls. Within the context of this project, our intent is really to focus on those issues of access, those issues of how to identify agents that are operating within my enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-limits-of-ai-is-just-software"&gt;The limits of ‘AI is just software’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIST’s instinct to frame AI as an extension of traditional software allows organizations to reuse familiar concepts — risk assessment, access control, logging, defense in depth — rather than starting from zero. Workshop participants repeatedly emphasized that many controls do transfer, at least in principle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But some experts argue that the analogy breaks down quickly in practice. AI systems behave probabilistically, not deterministically, they say. Their outputs depend on data that may change continuously after deployment. And in the case of agents, they may take actions that were not explicitly scripted in advance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs, the risk is not that AI is unrecognizable, but that it appears recognizable enough to lull organizations into applying controls mechanically. Treating AI as “just another application” can obscure new failure modes, particularly those involving &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110008/top-cyber-threats-to-your-ai-systems-and-infrastructure.html"&gt;indirect manipulation through data or prompts&lt;/a&gt; rather than direct exploitation of code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI agent systems really face a range of security threats and risks,” CAISI’s Hamin said at the workshop. “Some of these overlap with traditional software, but others kind of arise from the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109999/agentic-ai-already-hinting-at-cybersecuritys-pending-identity-crisis.html"&gt;unique challenge of combining AI model outputs&lt;/a&gt;, which are non-deterministic, with the affordances and abilities of software tools.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cisos-should-watch-out-for-framework-fatigue"&gt;CISOs should watch out for framework fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In kicking off the workshop, NIST senior policy advisor &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmegas/"&gt;Katerina Megas&lt;/a&gt; explained that NIST reached out to the CISO community to ask them what they need in terms of AI security guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Before we started down any path, we spoke to the CISO community, and we asked them, ‘So how are you all dealing with artificial intelligence? How is this affecting your day-to-day? Is this something that keeps you up at night?’ And overwhelmingly, the answer was yes, this is absolutely something that is top of mind for us. Our leadership is asking us, what are we doing?” she said at the event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the CISOs also told NIST that they were overwhelmed with AI documentation. A lot of these publications had some overlap, but were not identical, Megas said. “If you were a consumer of all of these documents, it was very difficult for you to look at them and understand how they relate to what you are doing and also understand how to identify where two documents may be talking about the same thing and where they overlap.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the guidance is super long, then people may not actually use it,” one workshop attendee, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveenkm94/"&gt;Naveen Konrajankuppam Mahavishnu&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and CTO at Aira Security, tells CSO, suggesting that much of the material can be reduced to more digestible components.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We can have a very detailed version, maybe a hundred pages long, but also have some sort of checklist that kind of summarizes the entire 100-page paper or something into a few pages where people can easily consume it, and then they can start implementing it,” Mahavishnu says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>EU’s answer to CVE solves dependency issue, adds fragmentation risks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123225/eus-answer-to-cve-solves-dependency-issue-adds-fragmentation-risks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security community has offered broad support for the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4118848/new-eu-vulnerability-database-launched.html"&gt;creation of an EU-hosted vulnerability database&lt;/a&gt; as a means of reducing dependence on US databases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, some experts have expressed concerns that the potential fragmentation of security intelligence risks impeding rapid vulnerability identification and remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Global Cybersecurity Vulnerability Enumeration database (&lt;a href="https://gcve.eu/"&gt;GCVE.eu&lt;/a&gt;) aggregates vulnerability advisories from more than 25 public sources into a single, searchable resource. Entries are normalized, structured, and cross-referenced across identifiers (e.g., CVE IDs, GCVE IDs, vendor IDs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform is hosted by Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg (CIRCL) in a Luxembourg-based data centre, with co-funding from the EU’s Federated European Team for Threat Analysis (FETTA) project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The emergence of GCVE.eu follows a funding scare that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3963190/cve-program-faces-swift-end-after-dhs-fails-to-renew-contract-leaving-security-flaw-tracking-in-limbo.html"&gt;threatened the continuation of the long-established Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program last year&lt;/a&gt;. The CVE program — which underpins the US National Vulnerability (NVD) database — is operated by the Mitre Corp., with funding from the cyber division of the US Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="combatting-flaw-fragmentation-mapping-and-interoperability"&gt;Combatting flaw fragmentation: Mapping and interoperability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaya Baloo, co-founder, COO, and CISO at vulnerability remediation startup AISLE, says that GCVE must prioritize mapping and interoperability with CVE entries in order to be viable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without enforceable interoperability commitments, ‘independent allocation’ becomes a polite way of saying defenders will need to check multiple incompatible systems to know if they’re vulnerable,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David Lindner, CISO at application security vendor Contrast Security, agreed that GCVE poses a risk of creating a new silo that mirrors but doesn’t align with the NVD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For a CISO the hard part is preventing identification collision where teams waste time triaging the same vulnerability under two different flags,” says Lindner. “To avoid this confusion and make the project viable the GCVE must prioritize an automated cross-mapping standard that bridges these databases in real-time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply switching from the US-run NVD to a European GCVE fails to solve the problem of dependency but only succeeds in changing the location of the silo, according to Lindner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Success requires a federated approach where vendors and researchers contribute to a unified intelligence layer ensuring that no matter which database claims the entry the industry sees a single actionable truth rather than a fragmented mess,” Lindner argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Blakley, CISO at Bellini Capital, warns that if GCVE offers only duplication without differentiation then it is liable to create a headache for security practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most security teams are already struggling with noise,” Blakley notes. “Any new database really needs to improve data quality, timeliness, or context and not just replicate identifiers under a different flag.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GCVE has cross-vulnerability referencing built in, with both automated and human-curated mechanisms, an approach most experts quizzed by CSO would minimise confusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zbyněk Sopuch, CTO of data security vendor Safetica, was more upbeat arguing that GCVE is designed to be backwards compatible with CVE, so “existing data is preserved and independent entries are allowed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The gray areas arise in scope, ID formats, and fragmented tracking, and there are steps that the GSVE can take to ensure that critical data is shared and received,” says Sopuch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="coordinated-disclosure"&gt;Coordinated disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nik Kale, principal engineer and product architect at Cisco Systems, says GCVE’s main challenge comes from building a platform that the security community can rely on for coordinated disclosure and remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Viability depends far more on governance than on the data itself,” Kale says. “That includes clear attribution rules, transparent CNA processes, predictable decision-making, and an explicit commitment to synchronization rather than fragmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US-run NVD system is long established so any parallel system must either federate cleanly with that existing infrastructure or provide clear operational advantages that justify switching, according to Kale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Researchers will gravitate toward whichever system enables the fastest, most reliable coordinated disclosure,” says Kale. “Vendors, meanwhile, need confidence that vulnerability records will be handled consistently regardless of where they originate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the GCVE project told CSO that CIRCL has both the relevant experience, &lt;a href="https://gcve.eu/process/"&gt;governance structures&lt;/a&gt;, and backing to make the database successful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CIRCL has been operating multiple services and open-source projects for more than 15 years, with sustained financial and in-kind support from the public sector, private sector, and EU and international organisations,” they explain. “GCVE.eu implements a level of governance that enables efficient operation, rapid delivery, and, most importantly, distributed allocation of identifiers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GCVE.eu has been fully functional and operational for several months. “We already deliver &lt;a href="https://www.vulnerability-lookup.org/"&gt;Vulnerability-Lookup&lt;/a&gt; as a complete open-source software and provide a reference database that facilitates the work of many organisations involved in vulnerability management,” GCVE tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="empowering-security-researchers"&gt;Empowering security researchers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fabian Gasser of cybersecurity consultancy Cyway says that GCVE brings benefits in removing the single point of failure inherent in reliance on the US-led CVE system while democratising vulnerability publishing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GCVE gives “more of a voice to independent security researchers, who can now also agree or disagree with vendor-self-assessments,” according to Gasser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel dos Santos, senior director and head of research at cybersecurity vendor Forescout, says that its &lt;a href="https://www.forescout.com/resources/exposing-the-exploited-a-quantitative-analysis-of-vulnerabilities-under-the-radar/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found a significant number of vulnerabilities without CVE IDs and even some that are exploited by threat actors. The GCVE has the potential to more quickly flag up exploited vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The GCVE DB has the advantage of aggregating several sources of vulnerability information and having a decentralized system of numbering authorities,” according to dos Santos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="redundancy"&gt;Redundancy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ferhat Dikbiyik, chief research and intelligence officer at cyber risk intelligence firm Black Kite, says the launch of GCVE is welcome following the funding scares of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For years, we treated the US-led CVE system as an immutable backbone,” Dr. Dikbiyik says. “When that backbone showed signs of stress due to budget politics, the world realized that relying on a single, centralized thread for vulnerability tracking was a strategic risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Localized vulnerability databases are already a reality in other regions, such as China.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Chinese platform is generally faster at indexing vendor disclosures and provides additional information compared to the US alternative,” says Martin Jartelius, AI product director at cybersecurity vendor Outpost24.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the GCVE to move from a regional project to a global standard, the focus must shift to integration with enterprise security tools, Dr. Dikbiyik argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A database is only as valuable as the tools that use it,” says Dr. Dikbiyik. “To make this project viable, we need to see security vendors, scanner providers, and GRC platforms treat the GCVE not as an extra feature, but as a core data source.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GCVE is less about competition and more about ensuring continuity, so that vulnerability disclosures don’t hinge on a single point of failure, according to Crystal Morin, senior cybersecurity strategist at Sysdig.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The success of the EU [vulnerability database] will be measured by how it complements existing efforts and supports faster triage, a smaller backlog, risk prioritization, and consistent access to quality data for the security community,” Morin says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Reports of GDPR violations have risen sharply</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4122281/reports-of-gdpr-violations-have-risen-sharply.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.dlapiper.com/en/insights/publications/2026/01/dla-piper-gdpr-fines-and-data-breach-survey-january-2026"&gt;report by law firm DLA Piper&lt;/a&gt;, organizations are increasingly being reported for violations of the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/562107/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-requirements-deadlines-and-facts.html"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the average number of daily reports has risen above 400 for the first time since the GDPR came into force across the EU on May 25, 2018. With 443 reports of violations per day, the number in 2025 was 22% higher than the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the data does not allow for any definitive conclusions about the causes of this increase, according to DLA Piper. The law firm believes that geopolitical tensions, the multitude of new technologies available to cyber threat actors, and a number of new laws mandating the reporting of security incidents are likely among the key factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="e1-2-billion-in-gdpr-fines"&gt;€1.2 billion in GDPR fines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to DLA Piper, the total amount of fines, at around €1.2 billion, was roughly the same as the previous year. However, this high sum also demonstrates that European data protection authorities remain willing to impose substantial fines. Since the GDPR came into effect, a total of €7.1 billion in fines has been levied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Broken down by country, Ireland, where US tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta have their EU headquarters, once again leads the enforcement statistics: The total fines imposed by the Irish Data Protection Commission have reached €4.04 billion since the GDPR came into force in May 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567531/the-biggest-data-breach-fines-penalties-and-settlements-so-far.html"&gt;highest fine ever imposed under the GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, amounting to €1.2 billion against Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd. Furthermore, in April 2025, TikTok Technology Ltd. was fined €530 million for transferring personal user data to China.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, DLA Piper points out that the risks of GDPR compliance are not limited to administrative fines. There is also the risk of subsequent claims for damages. Several landmark rulings by the CJEU and national European courts have addressed GDPR-related compensation claims — particularly regarding the requirements for claims for non-material damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>CISA chief uploaded sensitive government files to public ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4124320/cisa-chief-uploaded-sensitive-government-files-to-public-chatgpt.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency uploaded sensitive government contracting documents to a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering automated security alerts and raising questions about AI governance at the agency responsible for defending federal networks and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madhu Gottumukkala, who has led CISA since May 2025, uploaded at least four documents marked “for official use only” to OpenAI’s ChatGPT platform between mid-July and early August, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Politico reported&lt;/a&gt;. The documents contained contracting information not intended for public release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity sensors detected the activity in early August, generating several alerts in the first week alone, according to the report citing four Department of Homeland Security officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred despite Gottumukkala having personally requested special permission to use ChatGPT shortly after joining CISA. At the time, the AI tool was blocked for most DHS employees over concerns that sensitive information could be retained outside federal systems, the report added, citing the DHS officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data entered into the public version of ChatGPT can be incorporated into the model’s training data and exposed to hundreds of millions of users. Unlike DHS-approved AI tools with controls preventing inputs from leaving federal networks, the public ChatGPT retains uploaded information on OpenAI servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-ai-governance-failures-exposed"&gt;Enterprise AI governance failures exposed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The incident highlights systemic failures in how government agencies, and by extension, enterprises, manage AI tool exceptions for senior officials, security analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“FOUO is not classified, but it is still sensitive government information,” said Arjun Chauhan, practice director at Everest Group. “Uploading it to a public AI tool creates real exposure: loss of data control, expanded exposure surface, secondary misuse risk, and policy boundary collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pattern mirrors early enterprise incidents where employees pasted confidential material into ChatGPT, Chauhan said. The critical difference is that controls reportedly existed at CISA, and the breach occurred through an exception pathway. “That highlights a core governance failure. Exceptions and senior access are often where AI controls break down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal agencies now have &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/646291/if-you-dont-already-have-a-generative-ai-security-policy-theres-no-time-to-lose.html"&gt;AI policies&lt;/a&gt; and governance bodies, but the gap appears to be in execution rather than intent, according to Chauhan. Safe, approved AI tools are not always the default or most usable option, and enforcement varies by role and seniority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sunil Varkey, advisor at Beagle Security, said the incident reflects a broader organizational challenge. “Leadership teams may reference these tools positively for learning, productivity, and communication refinement, which unintentionally normalizes their use,” he said. “As a result, such platforms have rapidly become de facto productivity applications without being treated with the governance rigor typically applied to enterprise systems handling sensitive information.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tension between convenience and security often drives such incidents, Varkey added. Because “for official use only” data is not formally classified, users frequently underestimate its operational, contractual, or reputational impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaishiv Prakash, director analyst at Gartner, said the biggest risk when officials upload FOUO-marked documents to public AI platforms is losing control over the data. “You have no visibility into how long it’s retained, whether it can ever be deleted, or if it becomes exposed during legal holds or discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations must provide employees with licensed, governed AI platforms featuring supplier-agreed data residency, strict no-training guarantees, and minimal retention, Prakash said. “Without that, people will continue turning to public AI tools out of convenience, putting sensitive information at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leadership-credibility-questioned"&gt;Leadership credibility questioned&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The uploads triggered an internal DHS assessment involving the department’s then-acting general counsel Joseph Mazzara and chief information officer Antoine McCord, along with CISA’s chief information officer Robert Costello and chief counsel Spencer Fisher, the report said. The outcome has not been disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the report, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy confirmed that Gottumukkala received approval to use ChatGPT under DHS safeguards and described the usage as “short-term and limited.” She said he last used the tool in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception and that CISA’s default policy blocks ChatGPT access unless an exception is granted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fact that automated alerts triggered shows controls can detect misuse, analysts said, but the incident occurring at the leadership level raises accountability questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because this involves the head of the civilian cybersecurity agency, the impact is largely reputational,” Chauhan said. “Leaders set behavioral norms. Deviations undermine compliance culture and weaken credibility when advising other agencies and critical infrastructure operators.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ChatGPT incident adds to mounting controversies surrounding Gottumukkala’s brief tenure. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/21/cisa-acting-director-madhu-gottumukkala-polygraph-investigation-00701996" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Politico reported&lt;/a&gt; that he failed a counterintelligence polygraph test in late July and that DHS subsequently suspended six career staffers, characterizing the polygraph as “unsanctioned.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA has &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829710/firing-of-130-cisa-staff-worries-cybersecurity-industry.html"&gt;lost a significant number of its workforce&lt;/a&gt; since the Trump administration took office, with personnel dropping from over 3,300 to around 2,200 through buyouts, early retirements, and layoffs. The agency faces proposed budget cuts of nearly $500 million for fiscal year 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gottumukkala previously served as South Dakota’s chief information officer under then-Governor Kristi Noem, now DHS secretary. CISA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Roughly half of employees are using unsanctioned AI tools, and enterprise leaders are major culprits</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4124775/roughly-half-of-employees-are-using-unsanctioned-ai-tools-and-enterprise-leaders-are-major-culprits-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shadow AI, the secret, unapproved use of AI by employees, isn’t going away. In fact, workers are getting more brazen, and their employers often don’t seem to care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a new BlackFog survey, nearly half (49%) of workers admit to adopting &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086912/how-shadow-it-leaves-every-industry-in-the-dark.html" target="_blank"&gt;AI tools without employer approval&lt;/a&gt;, many using free versions with which they are freely sharing sensitive enterprise data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more alarmingly, a wide majority — 69% of presidents and C-suite members and 66% of directors and senior VPs — seem to be OK with this, prioritizing speed over privacy as they race to adopt AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The efficiency gains and personnel cost savings are too large to ignore, and override any security concerns,” said &lt;a href="https://www.blackfog.com/dr-darren-williams-founder-ceo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Darren Williams&lt;/a&gt;, BlackFog founder and CEO. The research is a “stark indication” of the wide use of unapproved AI tools in the enterprise, and also the “level of risk tolerance amongst employees and senior leaders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="shadow-ai-by-the-numbers"&gt;Shadow AI by the numbers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.blackfog.com/blackfog-research-shadow-ai-threat-grows/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of 2,000 workers at companies with more than 500 employees found that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4044007/shadow-ai-is-surging-getting-ai-adoption-right-is-your-best-defense.html" target="_blank"&gt;shadow AI&lt;/a&gt; is rampant, and not much is being done to rein it in. Of those surveyed, 86% said they use AI on a weekly basis at work, the most common use cases being in technical support, sales (such as email marketing), and contracts. But more than one-third of them admitted to using the free versions of company-approved tools, raising questions about where sensitive corporate data is being stored and processed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;51% have connected AI tools to work systems or apps without the approval or knowledge of IT;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;63% believe it’s acceptable to use AI when there is no corporate-approved option or IT oversight;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;60% say speed is worth the security risk;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;21% think employers will simply “turn a blind eye” as long as they’re getting their work done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the C-suite’s own use of shadow tools? That’s a little more difficult to gauge; they’re close-lipped about it, indicating a wider problem, Williams noted. “Senior executives often don’t want to admit they are using AI,” he said. Instead, they’re trying to prove how valuable they are without disclosing their own AI use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just like workers elsewhere in the enterprise, “senior leaders are able to get more done faster than ever” with AI, he noted. For instance, he said, “you can draft a legal contract in seconds and get a lawyer to review, rather than spend weeks drafting and redrafting using external counsel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concerningly, when it comes to the tools workers are using, free versions tend to be the most popular. More than half (58%) of employees using non-approved tools rely on free versions, and 34% of those working at companies that do allow AI tools are also opting for the free version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Non-paid is almost certainly worse because of the licensing and business models around them,” said Williams. “There is always a cost to using free tools; in this case it’s the value of your data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And employees are not shy about loading sensitive data into &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4117010/4-issues-holding-back-cisos-security-agendas.html" target="_blank"&gt;unsanctioned AI tools&lt;/a&gt;: 33% admit to sharing enterprise research or datasets; 27% to revealing employee data (such as salary or performance tracking); 23% to inputting company financial information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This becomes dangerous because virtually all free tools use ingested data to train their models, and some of the lower-tiered paid tools do, too, Williams pointed out. “And,” he said, “you cannot get this information back.” Paid enterprise plans typically allow companies to turn off training on their data, but not always. Admins must check this with their large language model (LLM) providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The big problem is the loss of intellectual property,” said Williams. And threat actors can get access to this information to profile and target an organization, breach their networks, and exfiltrate confidential data for extortion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The more data that is disclosed to LLMs, the more information is available [to threat actors] to build a better profile,” Williams noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprises-must-build-policies-around-ai-use"&gt;Enterprises must build policies around AI use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many CEOs have been mandating AI adoption and are allocating capital throughout the business for this purpose, Williams noted. Executives are looking for cost savings as a strategic advantage and a way to quickly return shareholder value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, security is an afterthought, he said. “Many companies have just chosen to ignore the problem, and have decided not to create a policy or see the value in paying for the technology, which is a very big mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations are “flying blind,” and 99% have no way of even knowing what is happening in their environments because there are no products in place to measure it, he observed. This should raise serious red flags for security teams, and there must be greater oversight and visibility into these security blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Williams advised enterprises to audit what is going on inside their systems, measure the scope of the problem, define policies around AI use, and adopt governance frameworks to control it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, employees must be made aware of the risks. Many, CISOs included, don’t actually understand the extent of the problem and its broader implications. “Education is essential and doesn’t require a lot of work,” said Williams. On the other hand, implementing a policy and framework does, and enterprises first need to decide what risks they are willing to live with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he said, we are navigating an unprecedented time in history, with new technology advancing at such a rapid pace that the technologists themselves don’t even know where it is going. Enterprises must quickly understand the implications, and use AI responsibly to gain a strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just as the industrial revolution and the internet changed the way we worked, AI is doing the same,” said Williams. “In fact, we expect this to be an even bigger shift than either of those transitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Human risk management: CISOs’ solution to the security awareness training paradox</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4123230/human-risk-management-cisos-solution-to-the-security-awareness-training-paradox.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity guru Bruce Scheier is often quoted as saying, “People are the weakest link in the security chain.” No more accurate words have ever been spoken about cybersecurity. You can spend millions of dollars on firewalls, endpoint security tools, access controls, and data encryption, but one employee can cause a catastrophic security breach, simply by downloading a malicious file or clicking on a rogue link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry research indicates that 70% to 90% of breaches are the result of employees succumbing to social engineering, making skills-based errors, sharing sensitive data with shadow IT services, or through a compromise of a privileged user. Oh, and things seem to be getting worse as adversaries &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt;adopt sophisticated AI-based attacks like deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, this problem is well known. As a countermeasure, organizations spent around $6 billion on &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;security awareness training (SAT)&lt;/a&gt; in 2025. While some firms did so as a best practice, most did so to comply with industry or government regulations such as HIPAA (requires a “security awareness and training program” for all workforce members per 45 CFR § 164.308), GDPR (article 39(1)(b) tasks data protection officers with “awareness-raising and training of staff”), PCI (requirement 12.6 mandates a formal program to make all personnel aware of cardholder data security), and many others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry research indicates that SAT expenses will increase by an estimated 15% per year as organizations continue to invest in what Gartner calls “security behavior and culture programs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-security-awareness-training-paradox"&gt;The security awareness training paradox&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While security awareness training has become a CISO and HR staple, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1246117/8-reasons-your-cybersecurity-training-program-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it.html"&gt;it continues to have questionable efficacy&lt;/a&gt;. Some organizations treat SAT as a checkbox exercise for regulatory compliance, with little regard to its value. Employees exacerbate this folly through “compliance theater,” clicking through tutorials as fast as possible &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567841/5-reasons-users-hate-cybersecurity-awareness-training-and-how-to-make-them-love-it.html"&gt;to get them out of their way&lt;/a&gt;. Even studious employees can suffer from the “forgetting curve,” a psychological model that illustrates how information is lost over time when there is no attempt to retain it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some cases, SAT can even be counterproductive. In some studies, employees who receive high grades with security awareness training become overly confident and complacent with their security behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, there’s a disillusioning situation here I call the security awareness training paradox. Despite regulatory compliance requirements and significant investment, SAT seems to deliver marginal benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clearly, SAT is broken — even with peripheral improvements like synthetic phishing tools. So, what’s needed? Over the next few years, organizations should shift from static/sporadic security training to an emerging discipline called human risk management (HRM).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-human-risk-management"&gt;What is human risk management?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HRM is defined as a cybersecurity strategy that identifies, measures, and reduces the risks caused by human behavior. Simply stated, security awareness training is about what employees know; HRM is about what they do (i.e., their actual cybersecurity behavior).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be more specific, HRM integrates into email security tools, web gateways, and identity and access management (IAM) systems to identify human vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it measures risk using behavioral data and pinpoints an organization’s riskiest users. HRM then seeks to mitigate these risks by applying targeted interventions such as micro-learning, simulations, or automated security controls. Finally, HRM monitors behavioral changes so organizations can track progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a misconception out there that HRM and SAT are different animals, so organizations interested in HRM must budget for both. Wrong. In fact, leading HRM solutions from vendors such as Fable Security, KnowBe4, and Mimecast offer HRM products chock full of standard SAT material. They even provide specific training support for regulatory compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="democratizing-security-training-with-ai"&gt;Democratizing security training with AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know what you’re thinking. HRM sounds like the latest buzz term coined by the cybersecurity industry marketing glitterati. Yeah, kind of true, but generic HRM has an AI-based partner riding shotgun. And unlike general industry AI hype, there’s research and expert agreement that AI is well positioned to change education as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;em&gt;Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI, &lt;/em&gt;University of Pennsylvania professor Ethan Mollick suggests that AI will deliver personalized learning at scale where AI acts as a “Socratic tutor” that “nudges” students toward excellence, provides simulations and role plays, and offers persona-based learning. In an HRM context, a “nudge” can be thought of as continuous micro-learning. A user clicks on a malicious link and is guided toward an appropriate security lesson aimed at reinforcing good hygiene and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Armed with AI, HRM will also understand habits and ways of learning. For example, Alice tends to learn best through written descriptions while Bob prefers watching videos. Leading HRM tools can also role play with users, gamifying cybersecurity training and playing on their competitive nature. Thus, HRM (with AI) has the potential to democratize expertise in a new and unique way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From an ROI perspective, HRM offers a much more granular approach to cyber-risk mitigation than standard SAT. CISOs and HR managers can report on improved cyber hygiene and behavior, rather than how many employees have been trained and past generic tests. Repeat offenders are not only identified but also provided with personalized training tools and attention. Ultimately, HRM makes it possible to show a direct correlation between training and a reduction in actual security incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To quote Aristotle, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” HRM is intended to personalize training to change behavior and habits. If Aristotle were a CISO, he’d surely see the logic in moving from generic SAT to HRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is nothing like &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/539824/data-protection-security-conferences-why-go.html"&gt;attending a face-to-face event&lt;/a&gt; for career networking and knowledge gathering, and we don’t have to tell you how helpful it can be to get a hands-on demo of a new tool or to have your questions answered by experts. Fortunately, plenty of great conferences are coming up in the months ahead. If keeping abreast of security trends and evolving threats is critical to your job — and we know it is — then attending some top-notch security conferences is on your must-do list for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From major events to those that are more narrowly focused, this list from the editors of CSO, will help you find the security conferences that matter the most to you. We’ll keep it updated with new conferences so check back often. While we don’t expect this calendar to be comprehensive, we do aim to have it be highly relevant. If there’s something we’ve missed, let us know. You can email your additions, corrections and updates to &lt;a href="mailto:samira_sarraf@foundryco.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samira Sarraf&lt;/a&gt;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
