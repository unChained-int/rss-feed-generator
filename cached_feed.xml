      <title>Notorious BreachForums hacking site hit by ‘doomsday’ leak of 324,000 criminal users</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115660/notorious-breachforums-hacking-site-hit-by-doomsday-leak-of-324000-criminal-users.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prominent crime forum BreachForums has suffered a new and possibly fatal blow to its reputation after the revelation that a database of thousands of criminals using it was stolen months ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;News of the breach emerged publicly on January 9 when a zip archive containing a MySQL database of 323,986 BreachForums users appeared on shinyhunte[.]rs, a domain reportedly unconnected to the infamous extortion group of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/em&gt;, the data breach happened last August, two months before the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071014/fbi-seizes-breachforums-servers-as-threatened-salesforce-data-release-deadline-approaches.html" target="_blank"&gt;police takedown&lt;/a&gt; of the BreachForums data extortion site after threats by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters to use it to release one billion records stolen from Salesforce customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This tallies with the August 11 date on the database leaked last week; that was the day its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BreachForums" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;admins reportedly announced&lt;/a&gt; that the site was being shut down for fear that it had been compromised by law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have I been Pwned&lt;/em&gt; said that the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/BreachForums2025" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;stolen data also included&lt;/a&gt; hashed passwords, private messages, and forum posts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However,  according to security intelligence firm &lt;a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/doomsday-for-cybercriminals-data-breach-of-major-dark-web-foru" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Resecurity&lt;/a&gt;, the January leak contains two new elements: a password-protected PGP private key file and a grandiloquent, bizarre 4,400 word manifesto entitled ‘Doomsday’ by an author using the name “James,” who claims to be behind the leak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PGP key, leaked a day later on January 10, was most likely used to sign messages from BreachForums’ admins, Resecurity said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="one-takedown-after-another"&gt;One takedown after another&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/breachforums-hacking-forum-database-leaked-exposing-324-000-accounts/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This leak&lt;/a&gt; is only the latest in a series of problems, arrests, and takedowns to affect what was once one of the biggest English-speaking crime forums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/united-states-leads-seizure-one-world-s-largest-hacker-forums-and-arrests-administrator" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RaidForums&lt;/a&gt; site seized by US authorities in 2022, BreachForums styled itself as a discussion site for topics such as data breaches, illegal sexual content, ransomware, and hacking tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the site’s alleged founder and admin, Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, was arrested, and its clearnet domains were seized three months later. &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/founder-one-worlds-largest-hacker-forums-resentenced-three-years-prison" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitzpatrick was later sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to three years in jail by a US court.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a replacement admin, Baphomet, was also &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2110830/breachforums-seized-by-law-enforcement-admin-baphomet-arrested.html" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly arrested&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4013356/us-indicts-one-for-role-in-breachforums-france-arrests-four-others.html" target="_blank"&gt;five more individuals&lt;/a&gt; accused of being connected to the site were taken into custody. Finally, last October came the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071014/fbi-seizes-breachforums-servers-as-threatened-salesforce-data-release-deadline-approaches.html" target="_blank"&gt;takedown of the BreachForums dark web extortion site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The immediate question is whether the leaked database will be of any use to police, assuming they don’t already have access to it. It contains email addresses and IP data which will most likely point to proxies or anonymizing services. One analysis found that many of the IP addresses are simply &lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-a-loopback-address/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;loopbacks&lt;/a&gt;. However, the most popular email service used to register with BreachForums is Gmail, which might provide a forensic link to anyone who’s been careless and not covered their tracks.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-question-of-data-integrity"&gt;A question of data integrity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts had mixed responses to the news of the database leak. “The breach significantly undermines trust in the platform itself, which is critical for any cybercrime forum,” said &lt;a href="https://www.cybaverse.co.uk/our-team/michael-jepson" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Jepson&lt;/a&gt;, penetration testing manager at consultancy CybaVerse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The exposure damages confidence in BreachForums as a secure environment. As a result, more sophisticated cyber criminals are likely to migrate away from large and well known forums toward smaller, invite-only communities,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/authors/michael-tigges" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Tigges&lt;/a&gt;, a senior security operations analyst at security company Huntress, was less sanguine. “While potentially useful for authorities and security professionals researching adversarial activities, the database is ultimately of limited forensics use. While the leak may be legitimate, the integrity is called in question if it was derived from another cybercrime group,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk was that data leaks could be a cover for the distribution of disinformation. “Data leaks like these may be used to draw lines between nuclei of activity, but the reliability of the information must be highly scrutinized,” said Tigges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Law enforcement authorities across Europe and South America continue to put sustained pressure on the criminal networks responsible for moving cocaine into Europe. Three recent actions coordinated by Europol, one targeting a Dutch-led network embedded in Colombian supply chains, another dismantling a Brazilian maritime trafficking operation and a third disrupting a Greek at-sea transfer criminal operation, highlight the ongoing efforts to disrupt the routes and structures used by organised crime.</description>

Als eine Art Stückliste hilft eine SBOM Anbietern und Käufern gleichermaßen, den Überblick über die Komponenten zu behalten und die Sicherheit der Softwarelieferkette zu verbessern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="sbom-definition"&gt;SBOM – Definition&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine Software &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Bill of Materials"&gt;Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt; ist eine formale, strukturierte Aufzeichnung, die die&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komponenten eines Softwareprodukts und&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ihre Beziehungen innerhalb der Softwarelieferkette&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;beschreibt. Eine SBOM gibt also einerseits an, welche Pakete und Bibliotheken in Ihre Anwendung eingeflossen sind, andererseits auch die Beziehung zwischen diesen Paketen und Bibliotheken und anderen vorgelagerten Projekten. Das ist besonders wichtig ist, wenn es um wiederverwendeten Code und Open-Source-Komponenten geht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sie kennen Stücklisten vielleicht im Zusammenhang mit Neuwagen. In diesem Fall handelt es sich um ein Dokument, das jede Komponente, die sich in Ihrem neuen Fahrzeug befindet, detailliert beschreibt. Auch wenn Ihr Auto von Toyota oder General Motors zusammengebaut wurde: Viele seiner Komponenten stammen von Subunternehmern auf der ganzen Welt. Die Stückliste gibt Aufschluss darüber, woher jedes einzelne dieser Teile stammt. Das dient nicht nur der Transparenz, sondern auch der Sicherheit: Wird eine bestimmte Serie von Airbags zurückgerufen, müssen die Fahrzeughersteller schnell herausfinden können, wo diese verbaut sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Da &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492659/datenlecks-finden-so-verhindern-sie-repository-leaks.html" target="_blank" title="Open-Source-Bibliotheken"&gt;Open-Source-Bibliotheken&lt;/a&gt; von Drittanbietern sich jedoch zunehmender Beliebtheit erfreuen, um containerisierte, verteilte Applikationen zu erstellen, weisen Softwareentwicklung und Fahrzeugfertigung inzwischen mehr Gemeinsamkeiten auf, als man denkt. Sowohl Entwickler als auch Benutzer können eine Software Bill of Materials verwenden, um nachzuvollziehen, welche Bestandteile in die Software eingeflossen sind, wie sie verteilt und verwendet wurden. Das erlaubt – insbesondere aus Sicherheitsperspektive – eine Reihe wichtiger Rückschlüsse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="software-bill-of-materials-vorteile"&gt;Software Bill of Materials – Vorteile&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Zeiten monolithischer, proprietärer Codebasen sind längst vorbei. Moderne Anwendungen basieren oft auf in großen Teilen wiederverwendetem Code – häufig mit Beteiligung von Open-Source-Bibliotheken. Diese Anwendungen werden auch zunehmend in kleinere, in sich geschlossene Funktionskomponenten, so genannte &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493670/container-schwachstellen-erkennen-tipps-und-tools-fur-eine-sichere-containernutzung.html" target="_blank" title="Container"&gt;Container&lt;/a&gt;, aufgeteilt, die über Orchestrierungsplattformen wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492006/kubernetes-security-wie-sie-ihre-cluster-besser-absichern.html" target="_blank" title="Kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; gemanagt und lokal oder in der Cloud ausgeführt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Großen und Ganzen waren diese Veränderungen ein Segen für die Softwareentwicklung und haben dazu beigetragen, die Entwicklerproduktivität zu erhöhen und Kosten zu senken. Aus Security-Perspektive sieht das Bild &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491662/softwarelieferkette-absicherndevops-pipelines-in-gefahr.html" target="_blank" title="nicht ganz so rosig aus"&gt;nicht ganz so rosig aus&lt;/a&gt;: Indem sie sich in hohem Maße auf den Code von Drittanbietern verlassen, (deren interne Prozesse sie möglicherweise nicht oder nur teilweise kennen), haben Entwickler eine Lieferkette von Softwarekomponenten geschaffen, die genauso komplex ist, wie die von Herstellern physischer Produkte. Da eine Anwendung jedoch nur so sicher ist wie ihre schwächste Komponente, kann dieses Gebahren gravierende Schwachstellen zur Folge haben. Die 2020er Jahre waren von einer Reihe von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492023/supply-chain-risk-management-so-wird-ihre-lieferkette-resilient.html" target="_blank" title="Angriffen auf die Softwarelieferkette"&gt;Angriffen auf die Softwarelieferkette&lt;/a&gt; geprägt, die für Schlagzeilen sorgten:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ende 2020 gelang es Hackern, die mit dem russischen Geheimdienst in Verbindung stehen sollen, eine Backdoor in die Netzwerk-Monitoring-Plattform von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492805/solarwinds-ciso-im-interview-mehr-offenheit-ist-gut-fur-die-branche.html" target="_blank" title="SolarWinds"&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; einzuschleusen. Diese wird wiederum von anderen Sicherheitsprodukten genutzt, was zu ihrer Kompromittierung führte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ende 2021 wurde eine schwerwiegende Sicherheitslücke in Apache Log4j entdeckt, einer Java-Bibliothek, die für die Protokollierung von Systemereignissen verwendet wird. Das hört sich nur so lange langweilig an, bis man feststellt, dass fast jede Java-Anwendung &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3498056/log4j-alarmstufe-rot-wegen-java-lucke.html" target="_blank" title="Log4j"&gt;Log4j&lt;/a&gt; in irgendeiner Form verwendet und damit angreifbar wird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Sicherheitskrisen verdeutlichen die potenzielle Rolle der Software Bill of Materials innerhalb der Sicherheitslandschaft. Viele Anwender haben vielleicht nur beiläufig von diesen Schwachstellen gehört, waren sich aber nicht bewusst, dass sie Log4j oder eine andere SolarWinds-Komponente verwenden. Mit einer SBOM wissen Sie genau, welche Pakete Sie installiert haben – und vor allem, welche Versionen dieser Pakete. So können Sie bei Bedarf aktualisieren, um auf der sicheren Seite zu sein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine Software Bill of Material kann auch über die Sicherheit hinausgehen: SBOMs können Entwicklern beispielsweise dabei helfen, den Überblick über die Open-Source-Lizenzen ihrer verschiedenen Softwarekomponenten zu behalten, was wichtig ist, wenn es darum geht, Applikationen zu distribuieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="sboms-pflicht-in-den-usa-und-bald-auch-in-europa"&gt;SBOMs – Pflicht in den USA und bald auch in Europa&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der SolarWinds-Hack hat insbesondere bei der US-Regierung die Alarmglocken schrillen lassen – auch weil viele US-Bundesbehörden die kompromittierte Komponente eingesetzt hatten. Deshalb enthielt die im Mai 2022 von der Biden-Regierung erlassene &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618730/biden-administration-releases-ambitious-cybersecurity-executive-order.html" target="_blank" title="Cybersecurity-Verordnung"&gt;Cybersecurity-Verordnung&lt;/a&gt; auch Richtlinien im Zusammenhang mit Software Bill of Materials. Das US-Handelsministerium veröffentlichte &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3622457/government-mandated-sboms-to-throw-light-on-software-supply-chain-security.html" target="_blank" title="einen Leitfaden"&gt;einen Leitfaden&lt;/a&gt;, welche grundlegenden Elemente in SBOMs enthalten sein müssen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obwohl sich die Anordnung speziell auf diejenigen bezieht, die in direkter Beziehung zu den US-Bundesbehörden stehen, werden die Regelungen weitergehende Auswirkungen haben. Schließlich werden die an die US-Regierung verkauften Produkte, die nun mit einer SBOM ausgeliefert werden müssen, größtenteils auch an andere Unternehmen und Organisationen verkauft. Viele Softwarehersteller hoffen, dass die Kunden aus der Privatwirtschaft SBOMs ebenfalls &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3663468/for-one-software-maker-an-sbom-adds-value-to-the-product.html" target="_blank" title="als Mehrwert betrachten"&gt;als Mehrwert betrachten&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Außerdem ist das staatliche Auftragswesen selbst eine Lieferkette, wie Sounil Yu, ehemaliger Chief Security Scientist bei der Bank of America und jetzt CISO und Forschungsleiter bei JupiterOn, unterstreicht: “Es gibt nur eine bestimmte Anzahl von Unternehmen, die direkt mit der US-Regierung zusammenarbeiten und von der Verordnung betroffen sind. Die Auswirkungen auf der zweiten Zuliefererebene sind noch wesentlich größer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Europa wird die SBOM ebenfalls verpflichtend – und zwar im Rahmen der Umsetzung des &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Cyber_Resilience_Act/cyber_resilience_act.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a&gt; bis Ende 2027. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="software-bill-of-materials-aufbau"&gt;Software Bill of Materials – Aufbau&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Als Reaktion auf die Executive Order veröffentlichte die National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) im Juli 2021 den Leitfaden “&lt;a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="The Minimum Elements For a Software Bill of Materials"&gt;The Minimum Elements For a Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a&gt;” (PDF). Das Dokument könnte zu einem De-facto-Standard für SBOMs in der gesamten Branche werden und legt sieben Datenfelder fest, die jede SBOM enthalten sollte:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name des Anbieters:&lt;/strong&gt; Der Name einer Einheit, die eine Komponente erstellt, definiert und identifiziert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Komponentenname:&lt;/strong&gt; Die Bezeichnung, die einer vom ursprünglichen Lieferanten definierten Softwareeinheit zugewiesen wird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version der Komponente:&lt;/strong&gt; Eine Kennung, die vom Lieferanten verwendet wird, um eine Änderung der Software gegenüber einer zuvor identifizierten Version anzugeben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andere eindeutige Identifikatoren:&lt;/strong&gt; Andere Informationen, die verwendet werden, um eine Komponente zu identifizieren oder als Nachschlageschlüssel für relevante Datenbanken dienen. Das könnte etwa ein Identifikator aus dem &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST CPE Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; sein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abhängigkeitsbeziehung:&lt;/strong&gt; Kennzeichnet die Beziehung, in der eine Upstream-Komponente X in Software Y enthalten ist. Das ist besonders wichtig für Open-Source-Projekte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autor der SBOM-Daten:&lt;/strong&gt; Der Name der Entität, die die SBOM-Daten erstellt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zeitstempel:&lt;/strong&gt; Aufzeichnung des Datums und der Uhrzeit der Zusammenstellung der SBOM-Daten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SBOMs müssen darüber hinaus auch folgende Anforderungen erfüllen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die SBOM muss in einem von &lt;strong&gt;drei standardisierten Formaten&lt;/strong&gt; vorliegen, damit sie maschinenlesbar ist – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="SPDX"&gt;SPDX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="CycloneDX"&gt;CycloneDX&lt;/a&gt; oder &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Software-Identification-SWID" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="SWID-Tags"&gt;SWID-Tags&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mit jeder neuen Softwareversion &lt;strong&gt;muss eine neue SBOM generiert werden&lt;/strong&gt;, um sicherzustellen, dass sie auf dem neuesten Stand ist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die SBOM muss nicht nur Abhängigkeitsbeziehungen enthalten, sondern auch Aufschluss darüber geben, &lt;strong&gt;wo solche Beziehungen wahrscheinlich bestehen&lt;/strong&gt;, aber der Organisation, die die SBOM erstellt, unbekannt sind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="sbom-erstellen-so-gehts"&gt;SBOM erstellen – so geht’s&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Sie diesen Artikel lesen, empfinden Sie es möglicherweise als entmutigende Aufgabe, eine Software Bill of Materials zu erstellen. Schließlich muss es ein Alptraum sein, all diese Informationen manuell zusammenzutragen. Glücklicherweise werden SBOMs in den meisten Fällen mit Hilfe von SCA-Tools (Software Composition Analysis ) automatisch erstellt. Diese Tools werden häufig in DevSecOps-Pipelines eingesetzt und spielen nicht nur für die Erstellung von SBOMs eine Rolle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCA-Tools durchsuchen Ihre Codeverzeichnisse nach Paketen und vergleichen sie mit Online-Datenbanken, um sie mit bekannten Bibliotheken abzugleichen. Es gibt aber auch Werkzeuge, die eine Software Bill of Materials im Rahmen des Software-Build-Prozesses &lt;a href="https://blog.chainguard.dev/auto-sboms-with-ko/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="erstellen"&gt;erstellen&lt;/a&gt;. Die OWASP Foundation hat eine umfassende Liste von SCA-Tools &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Component_Analysis" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="zusammengestellt"&gt;zusammengestellt&lt;/a&gt;, die von einfachen, quelloffenen Kommandozeilen-Tools bis hin zu spezialisierten, kommerziellen Produkten reicht. Wenn Sie tiefer in diesen Bereich eintauchen möchten, sollten Sie außerdem einen Blick auf unseren Artikel “&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2813071/7-tools-die-ihre-softwarelieferkette-absichern.html" target="_blank" title="7 Tools, die Ihre Softwarelieferkette absichern"&gt;7 Tools, die Ihre Softwarelieferkette absichern&lt;/a&gt;” werfen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Sie verteilte Software entwickeln, wird es immer wichtiger, SBOMs in Ihre Entwicklungspraxis zu integrieren. Auch wenn Sie keine Verträge mit der US-Regierung abschließen – Sie sollten sich angesichts der Bedrohungslage in jedem Fall Gedanken über die Sicherheit ihrer Softwarelieferkette machen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>CISOs’ top 10 cybersecurity priorities for 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114020/cisos-top-10-cybersecurity-priorities-for-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity threats are becoming more sophisticated, more automated, and more intelligent, as well as harder to detect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time the enterprise attack surface CISOs are tasked to defend continues to expand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the reality security chiefs face in 2026 — a reality that has CISOs reordering their priorities for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preparing for and defending against AI-enabled attacks is high on CISOs’ to-do list this year. As is securing their organization’s own AI deployments and advancing the use of AI in security operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those priorities are in addition to many longstanding security undertakings as well as emerging areas of concern that will also dominate the CISO agenda in the upcoming year. Security leaders say these priorities reflect the ever-increasing challenges of defending their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="doubling-down-on-core-security-tasks"&gt;Doubling down on core security tasks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although AI has emerged as a top issue for security leaders, &lt;a href="https://foundryco.com/research/security-priorities/"&gt;Foundry’s Security Priorities Survey&lt;/a&gt; recently found that CISOs remain focused on several core security tasks, with strengthening data protection the No. 1 priority, cited by 48% of security chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-levinstein-a04a6a36/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amit Levinstein&lt;/a&gt;, who is both a CISO and a CISO advisor, specifically calls out data protection as a top priority for his own organization and his clients’ security departments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Levinstein, CISO and vice president of professional services at cybersecurity firm CYE, acknowledges that data protection has been a key security task for a long time but says it has become more challenging in the age of AI, as the technology “creates a lot of different risks from a data leakage perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To counteract those risks, Levinstein relies on &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2093806/6-security-items-that-should-be-in-every-ai-acceptable-use-policy.html"&gt;strong AI usage policies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3984527/how-to-establish-an-effective-ai-grc-framework.html"&gt;robust AI governance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2139982/cios-help-set-the-workforce-ai-training-agenda.html"&gt;employee training&lt;/a&gt; to establish and enforce when AI can be used and with what data and security controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To do this effectively, he says he and other CISOs must “understand what the business is doing, understand the business’ priorities and then devise the right approach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other longstanding core security tasks CISOs list as top priorities include securing cloud data and systems, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;simplifying IT security infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3975448/top-tips-for-successful-threat-intelligence-usage.html"&gt;improving threat intelligence operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other top 10 priorities from the Foundry survey include &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;enhancing security awareness through end-user training&lt;/a&gt;; streamlining compliance and privacy efforts; reducing spending; and assuming responsibility for risks presented by operational technology systems, IoT devices, and/or endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prepping-for-ai-enabled-attacks"&gt;Prepping for AI-enabled attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although conventional tasks dominate the CISO priorities in the Foundry survey, interviews and other research show that AI-related issues are also high on the CISO priority list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, 53% of security leaders ranked AI-enabled cyber threats as a top-three organizational risk in a &lt;a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-raising-stakes-in-cybersecurity"&gt;global survey conducted by Boston Consulting Group&lt;/a&gt;. BCG also reported that 60% of organizations have likely experienced an AI-powered cyberattack in the past year, although only 7% have installed AI-driven cyber defense tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Offense is scaling faster than defense. AI is accelerating attack capabilities far more quickly than organizations can strengthen their defenses,” BCG notes in its report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101491/polymorphic-ai-malware-exists-but-its-not-what-you-think.html"&gt;hype over AI-enabled threats&lt;/a&gt; has come under scrutiny, security experts warn that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101936/ignoring-ai-in-the-threat-chain-could-be-a-costly-mistake-experts-warn.html"&gt;ignoring AI in the threat chain could be costly&lt;/a&gt; for CISOs, given the rise of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4111384/top-5-real-world-ai-security-threats-revealed-in-2025.html"&gt;real-world AI security threats in&lt;/a&gt; the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rolling-out-ai-to-enhance-security-operations"&gt;Rolling out AI to enhance security operations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although a sliver of organizations surveyed by BCG have deployed AI-driven cyber defense tools, the vast majority (88%) plan to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foundry similarly found in its survey that 38% of security leaders listed accelerating use of AI to improve security effectiveness as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmomin/"&gt;Aaron Momin&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of Synechron, a digital transformation consulting and solutions firm, sees &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042494/how-ai-is-reshaping-cybersecurity-operations.html"&gt;AI as an essential security tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CISOs are prioritizing AI systems that detect and neutralize cyber threats without humans in the loop to reduce the time to respond,” he says. “When AI-powered attacks hit in milliseconds, human-speed response is inadequate and requires AI to fight against AI.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Momin also has prioritized deploying &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4064158/agentic-ai-in-it-security-where-expectations-meet-reality.html"&gt;autonomous AI agents in security&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “these agents are expected to execute tasks on their own, such as automating access revocation based on risk factors or blocking the cyber threat before propagation. It comes down to speed. Attackers are using AI to iterate on their attacks faster than any human analyst can triage an alert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="securing-enterprise-ai-deployments"&gt;Securing enterprise AI deployments&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts say AI-enabled security operations and the speed AI brings are also critical for &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4033338/how-cybersecurity-leaders-are-securing-ai-infrastructures.html"&gt;defending their organization’s growing AI deployments&lt;/a&gt; and the expanded attack surface those deployments create.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI is a big bang for the attack surface. The models are expanding the surface so quickly,” says Deloitte’s U.S. cyber AI leader &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/people/profiles.mark-nicholson+6d7b9653.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Nicholson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nicholson says the growing use of AI doesn’t change the fundamental responsibilities of the security program, “but it does change the urgency and the way security needs to be implemented. CISOs now see embedding cybersecurity and trust and transparency in the AI development process as a priority. CISOs must have as a priority secure AI and trust in AI by design.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reining-in-shadow-ai"&gt;Reining in shadow AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs acknowledge they must also confront the risks that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2138447/unauthorized-ai-is-eating-your-company-data-thanks-to-your-employees.html"&gt;unsanctioned AI deployments create&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you look at risks of shadow AI, you’re looking at loss of control of data, an expanded attack surface, compliance and regulatory risk, lack of control and visibility, loss of intellectual property, and reputational damage,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lina-dabit-7a78a8173/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Lina Dabit&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the CISO office at Optiv Canada. “And there is also the risk of inaccurate and biased outcomes, because if you’re employees aren’t using AI through a sanctioned process, then the question also becomes where are they getting their information from [to feed to the shadow AI system] and how reliable is it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs are monitoring their environments for shadow AI and educating the workforce on its risks, Dabit says, but many continue to encounter uses of unsanctioned AI in their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some research predicts the security risks of shadow AI will be an even bigger issue in the coming year. Researchers for &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/resources/cybersecurity-forecast"&gt;Google Cloud Security’s Cybersecurity Forecast 2026 report&lt;/a&gt; write that “by 2026, we expect the proliferation of sophisticated AI Agents will escalate the ‘Shadow AI’ problem into a critical ‘Shadow Agent’ challenge. In organizations, employees will independently deploy these powerful, autonomous agents for work tasks, regardless of corporate approval. This will create invisible, uncontrolled pipelines for sensitive data, potentially leading to data leaks, compliance violations, and IP theft.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google researchers say that “banning agents is not a viable option, as it only drives usage off the corporate network, eliminating visibility.” Instead, they advise “a new discipline of AI security and governance” and, like Nicholson, advocate for “a secure-by design approach, integrating protection from the start.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rethinking-identity-and-access-management"&gt;Rethinking identity and access management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The growing use of AI has CISOs in 2026 prioritizing another longstanding area of security work: identity and access management. This came in No. 6 on Foundry’s survey of top CISO priorities for the coming year.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.isc2.org/b/sp/jon-france-5332"&gt;Jon France&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of ISC2, a cybersecurity training and certification organization, says there’s a heightened importance to identity management as organizations start to deploy agentic AI — a move that will require organizations to manage “not just human identities but thing identities as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;France is using &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/564201/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt; and multifactor authentication to help ensure only authorized entities — whether humans or machines — gain access to systems. He’s also evaluating the use of passkeys instead of tokens for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, he recognizes that he and others have a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109999/agentic-ai-already-hinting-at-cybersecuritys-pending-identity-crisis.html"&gt;big challenge around identity and access management&lt;/a&gt; as agents become more common and where the proliferation of agents introduces more potential for some agents to gain unauthorized permissions to access systems from other agents in the chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defending-against-deepfakes"&gt;Defending against deepfakes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelebaker/"&gt;Mike Baker&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at DXC Technology, is also prioritizing identity — but he’s specifically concerned with verifying the identity of people in an &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3529639/deepfakes-break-through-as-business-threat.html"&gt;era of deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure the person you’re talking to or emailing is really the person you think it is,” he says, noting that AI advancements enable hackers to make a deepfake that is nearly indistinguishable from the real McCoy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baker says he’s using various security tools (including multimodal authentication) and strategies (such as employee training) to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt;counteract the deepfake threat&lt;/a&gt; and help ensure his organization’s employees can spot a deepfake scam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tackling-third-party-management"&gt;Tackling third-party management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baker also lists &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1305977/6-best-practices-for-third-party-risk-management.html"&gt;improving third-party risk management&lt;/a&gt; as a priority. It’s one shared by many CISOs, coming in at No. 11 on Foundry’s survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third-party risk has always been there, France says, but it’s coming to the fore as organizations have an increasing number of suppliers and an increasing reliance on them to operate. Major outages at AWS, Azure, and Cloudflare in 2025 should indicate to all organizations the importance of strengthening third-party risk management, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baker adds that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3846304/ai-development-pipeline-attacks-expand-cisos-software-supply-chain-risk.html"&gt;AI also fuels the need to improve third-party risk management practices&lt;/a&gt;. As a CISO, he wants to understand the AI models built into the software products his organization is using to ensure they’re protecting his company’s data, that their models are secure, and that they’re reliable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bolstering-resiliency"&gt;Bolstering resiliency&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;France says third-party risk management can also &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2111061/cyber-resilience-a-business-imperative-cisos-must-get-right.html"&gt;bolster corporate resiliency&lt;/a&gt; — another priority for him and other CISOs. It came in at No. 13 on Foundry’s CISO priorities list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research firm &lt;a href="https://www.evanta.com/resources/ciso/blog/three-key-themes-for-cisos-in-2026"&gt;Gartner lists resiliency as one of three key themes&lt;/a&gt; for CISOs in 2026, noting that “cyber resilience goes well beyond IT recovery plans — it includes legal, public relations, market disclosures, and supplier readiness. It’s about full, end-to-end coordination and readiness across departments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/awmccray/"&gt;Aaron McCray&lt;/a&gt;, field CISO for technology solutions and services company CDW, says more CISOs are focused on resiliency as security leaders work to align with business strategy and see security as a business enabler.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CISOs are looking at how they can recover from operational events, not just cyber events, they’re looking at how to retain functions during crises and how to restore functions in real-time,” McCray adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="grappling-with-geopolitical-risk"&gt;Grappling with geopolitical risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs in 2026 are paying more attention to geopolitical risks, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/betsysoehrenjones/"&gt;Betsy Soehren Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a partner at technology consulting firm West Monroe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is good reason for the heightened interest in international affairs, as global events can spur those nation-states already engaged in cyberattacks to ramp up their activities, Soehren Jones explains. Global events can also disrupt supply chains and resources, including offshore workers and software services, she adds, which can have implications for CISOs and their teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soehren Jones, who formerly worked as director of security strategy at an energy company, advises CISOs to join intelligence communities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567485/what-is-an-isac-or-isao-how-these-cyber-threat-information-sharing-organizations-improve-security.html"&gt;industry ISACs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4003811/trump-takes-aim-at-bidens-cyber-executive-order-but-leaves-it-largely-untouched.html"&gt;review White House executive orders&lt;/a&gt;, federal directives, and similar material to glean information on emerging geopolitical risks and threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also advises CISOs to work with their company’s federal affairs office, if their company has one, to better understand and prepare for the global issues that concern the company. CISOs should also work with trade associations and follow the US Chamber of Commerce to stay abreast of geopolitical risks, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PwC’s &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-risk-regulatory/library/global-digital-trust-insights.html"&gt;2026 Global Digital Trust Insights&lt;/a&gt; found that 60% of the 3,887 business and tech executives across 72 countries surveyed for the study ranked cyber risk investment in their top three strategic priorities in response to ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Iran-linked MuddyWater APT deploys Rust-based implant in latest campaign</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115379/iran-linked-muddywater-apt-deploys-rust-based-implant-in-latest-campaign.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Iran-linked advanced persistent threat group MuddyWater has deployed a Rust-based implant in an ongoing espionage campaign targeting organizations in Israel and other Middle Eastern countries, according to CloudSEK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CloudSEK’s TRIAD team said it identified the spear-phishing campaign targeting diplomatic, maritime, financial, and telecom entities across the Middle East. The campaign uses icon spoofing and malicious Word documents to deliver RustyWater, which the researchers described as “a Rust-based implant representing a significant upgrade to their traditional toolkit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Historically, Muddy Water has relied on PowerShell and VBS loaders for initial access and post-compromise operations,”  the cybersecurity firm wrote in a blog post. “The introduction of Rust-based implants represents a notable tooling evolution toward more structured, modular, and low noise RAT capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MuddyWater, which Microsoft tracks as Mango Sandstorm and ProofPoint identifies as TA450, operates under Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to the US cybersecurity agency &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-055a" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CISA&lt;/a&gt;. The group has been active since at least 2017, targeting government agencies, telecommunications providers, and critical infrastructure across the Middle East, Asia, and Europe, according to security firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research comes amid continued activity by MuddyWater throughout 2024 and into early 2025. ESET researchers published findings in December 2024 showing the group &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/674936/iran-linked-spy-apt-muddywater-ratchets-up-anti-israel-attacks-report.html"&gt;deployed the MuddyViper backdoor&lt;/a&gt; against Israeli organizations between September 2024 and March 2025. Security firms have also documented MuddyWater deploying &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/new-bugsleep-backdoor-deployed-in-recent-muddywater-campaigns/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BugSleep&lt;/a&gt; implants and using legitimate remote monitoring and management tools in recent campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="spear-phishing-delivery"&gt;Spear-phishing delivery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack chain begins with spear-phishing emails containing malicious ZIP archives, according to the blog post. The archives include a legitimate PDF document and a disguised executable file bearing a PDF icon. When victims execute the file, it displays the decoy PDF while executing the malware, the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They wrote that the initial loader establishes persistence through Windows Registry modifications and deploys RustyWater as a secondary payload. The implant communicates with command-and-control infrastructure using HTTP/HTTPS protocols and supports file system enumeration, command execution, and data exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CloudSEK identified command-and-control domains mimicking legitimate services, including infrastructure posing as Dropbox and WordPress platforms. Several domains were registered through Hostinger, a hosting provider the cybersecurity firm said has been frequently abused by threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rust-offers-evasion-advantages"&gt;Rust offers evasion advantages&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CloudSEK researchers said RustyWater was developed in Rust, which they said is increasingly used by malware authors for its memory safety features and cross-platform capabilities, according to the blog post. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russia’s Gossamer Bear and China-linked actors, have also deployed Rust-based malware in recent campaigns, according to security researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implant incorporates checks for virtual machine environments, debugging tools, and sandbox systems. “RustyWater begins execution by establishing anti-debugging and anti-tampering mechanisms,” the researchers wrote. “It registers a Vectored Exception Handler (VEH) to catch debugging attempts and systematically gathers victim machine information, including username, computer name, and domain membership.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RustyWater also uses string obfuscation and multi-stage payload delivery, the researchers said. The malware encrypts all strings using position-independent XOR encryption and implements randomized sleep intervals between command-and-control callbacks to avoid detection, according to the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="broader-targeting"&gt;Broader targeting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CloudSEK said its investigation primarily focused on targeting within Israel, but the researchers observed indicators suggesting MuddyWater may have expanded operations to include victims in India, the UAE, and other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The campaign targeting Israeli entities used Hebrew-language decoy documents related to government agencies and the Israel Defense Forces, the blog post added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MuddyWater has focused on espionage operations aimed at collecting government and military intelligence, according to security researchers. Previous campaigns attributed to the group used various remote access tools and custom malware families, including the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/644268/command-and-control-framework-phonyc2-attributed-to-irans-muddywater-group.html"&gt;PhonyC2 command-and-control framework&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/575119/iran-cyberespionage-group-taps-simplehelp-for-persistence-on-victim-devices.html"&gt;legitimate remote administration tools like SimpleHelp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In November 2024, Amazon Threat Intelligence &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093375/iranian-apt-hacks-helped-direct-missile-strikes-in-israel-and-the-red-sea.html"&gt;correlated MuddyWater activity with subsequent missile strikes&lt;/a&gt;, showing the group accessed compromised servers containing live CCTV feeds prior to attacks in Israel and the Red Sea. CloudSEK recommended organizations implement email security controls, conduct security awareness training to help employees identify phishing attempts, and deploy endpoint detection and response solutions capable of identifying suspicious process behavior and network communications patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Malicious npm packages target the n8n automation platform in a supply chain attack</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115417/malicious-npm-packages-target-n8n-automation-platform-in-a-supply-chain-attack.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors were spotted weaponizing the n8n automation ecosystem this week, slipping malicious npm packages into its marketplace of community-maintained nodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deceptive packages, disguised as legitimate integrations like Google Ads connectors, lured developers into connecting &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3833826/how-to-configure-oauth-in-microsoft-365-defender-and-keep-your-cloud-secure.html" target="_blank"&gt;OAuth&lt;/a&gt; and API keys, enabling attackers to extract sensitive tokens and credentials through a seemingly routine workflow execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Endor Labs, which discovered the campaign, the attack represents a new escalation in supply chain threats. “To our knowledge, the n8n workflow automation platform has not been targeted before by supply chain attacks,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henrikplate/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Henrik Plate&lt;/a&gt;, lead researcher at Endor Labs. “It shows that attackers keep on targeting new ecosystems to spread malicious packages, maybe due to tightening controls in other ecosystems like npm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Endor Labs warned in a blog post that enterprises used to monitoring build systems for supply-chain abuse may miss this class of attack entirely, as it targets automation platforms that already sit deep inside business workflows. The activity follows a max-severity n8n vulnerability disclosure (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4113980/critical-rce-flaw-allows-full-takeover-of-n8n-ai-workflow-platform.html"&gt;CVE-2026-21858&lt;/a&gt;), though researchers have not established any connection between the incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How the attack unpacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack begins with the publication of a malicious npm package to the public registry. These packages pose as community nodes, the extensions that n8n users can install to expand automation capabilities. Once installed, the malicious node behaves like any other integration, presenting configuration screens and collecting credentials required for typical workflow tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Behind the scenes, however, it executes code that decrypts stored OAuth tokens and API keys from n8n’s credential store and exfiltrates them to remote command-and-control (C2) servers controlled by the attackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach succeeds because n8n treats all installed nodes as trusted code. There’s no pre-publication review on npm, and installed nodes run with full access to the workflow environment. This means the nodes can read decrypted credentials, make arbitrary network requests, and interact with the host system just as legitimate nodes do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“According to security researchers at data security company Cyera, there were more than 100,000 n8n servers vulnerable to CVE-2026-21858,” Endor researchers said in the &lt;a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/n8mare-on-auth-street-supply-chain-attack-targets-n8n-ecosystem" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. “We do not know how many of those install npm packages as community nodes in their environments. Still, this number shows that the n8n ecosystem is active and thriving.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tips for reducing risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Workflow automation platforms like n8n are widely adopted for their capability to let teams link disparate systems without hand-coding every integration. But the community node ecosystem depends on npm packages and, therefore, inherits associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To mitigate exposure, Endor Labs researchers recommended measures such as preferring built-in integrations over community nodes, auditing package metadata and source code before installation, monitoring outbound network activity from automation hosts, and using isolated service accounts with limited privileges wherever possible. Endor Labs published a list of indicators of compromise (IOCs), including package names, C2 infrastructure, and malicious files, to support detection efforts. “Even though the malicious packages we know have been disabled in the last few hours, the attacks may continue and evolve going forward,” Plate noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Heutige Anwendungen basieren auf zahlreichen Komponenten, von denen jede zusammen mit den Entwicklungsumgebungen selbst eine Angriffsfläche darstellt. Unabhängig davon, ob Unternehmen Code intern entwickeln oder sich auf Drittanbieter verlassen, sollten CISOs, Sicherheitsexperten und Entwickler der Software-Supply-Chain besondere Aufmerksamkeit schenken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zu den Risiken zählen zum Beispiel React2Shell, Shai-Hulud oder XZ Utils, alles Schwachstellen in der Software-Lieferkette, die im Kleinen angefangen haben und später massive Auswirkungen hatten. Shai-Hulud sticht dabei besonders heraus, es signalisiert das Ende der „passiven Ära” der Angriffe auf Lieferketten und den Beginn der „aktiven Wurm”-Ära. Diese Veränderung verspricht verheerende Folgen für Software-Pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionell waren Angriffe auf die Lieferkette passive Fallen. Ein Angreifer lud ein falsch geschriebenes Paket (Typosquatting) wie „reqeusts“ anstelle von „requests“ hoch, lehnte sich zurück und wartete darauf, dass ein müder Entwickler einen Fehler machte. Der Explosionsradius war linear und eher langsam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mit Shai-Hulud wurden die Spielregeln verändert, indem es eine wurmähnliche Verbreitung einführte. Sobald es auf dem Rechner eines Entwicklers landet, sammelt es aktiv Anmeldedaten (NPM-Token, GitHub-Geheimnisse). Es nutzt diese gestohlenen Anmeldedaten, um infizierte Versionen anderer legitimer Pakete, die das Opfer verwaltet, automatisch zu veröffentlichen. Im Gegensatz zu Spyware, die verborgen bleiben will, enthalten Varianten von Shai-Hulud einen „Dead Man Switch“. Wenn er feststellt, dass er blockiert oder analysiert wird, versucht er, das System des Opfers zu löschen und dabei alle Spuren von sich selbst vollständig zu entfernen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Ziel ist nicht mehr nur die Anwendung, sondern die Identität des Entwicklers und die automatisierten CI/CD-Pipelines, die ihm implizit vertrauen. Was wäre nun, wenn die nächste Variante des Shai-Hulud andere Code-Sprachen betrifft?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-sprachen-als-tickende-zeitbomben"&gt;Code-Sprachen als tickende Zeitbomben&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Beispiel dafür wäre Python, sie ist die Sprache der KI und der Data Science. Die nächste Evolutionsstufe des Supply-Chain-Wurms wird wahrscheinlich nicht nur AWS-Schlüssel stehlen, sondern auch den Aufstieg von KI-Codierungsassistenten nutzen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicherheitsforscher beobachten bereits „Halluzinations-Hijacking“, bei dem Angreifer Pakete registrieren, deren Existenz KI-Tools fälschlicherweise vorhersagen. Ein Wurm im Stil von Shai-Hulud könnte den Laptop eines Data Scientists infizieren, dessen lokalen LLM-Chatverlauf nach privaten Paketnamen durchsuchen und automatisch bösartige Versionen öffentlich registrieren. Ein Wurm in diesem Ökosystem würde nicht nur eine Website zum Absturz bringen, sondern könnte auch Finanzmodelle subtil vergiften, medizinische Forschungsdaten verändern oder Backdoors in KI-Trainingssets von Unternehmen einbauen – Schäden, die möglicherweise jahrelang unentdeckt bleiben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weitere Beispiele könnten die Code-Sprachen Java/JVM oder Rust/Go betreffen, auch hier wären die Auswirkungen katastrophal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-polyglot-supply-chain-attacke"&gt;Die Polyglot Supply-Chain-Attacke&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die erschreckendste Aussicht ist jedoch das Zusammentreffen dieser Bedrohungen in einer Polyglot-Supply-Chain-Attacke. Derzeit arbeiten Sicherheitsteams isoliert voneinander. AppSec überwacht den Code, CloudSec überwacht AWS, NetworkSec überwacht den Perimeter. Ein Polyglot-Angriff ist darauf ausgelegt, diese Silos nahtlos zu durchbrechen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dies geschieht folgendermaßen: Ein Wurm dringt über eine Low-Level-JavaScript-Abhängigkeit in den Laptop eines Frontend-Entwicklers ein. Er erkennt, dass der Entwickler auch Zugriff auf das Backend-Rust-Repository des Unternehmens hat, stiehlt diese Anmeldedaten und injiziert bösartige Build-Skripte in die Rust-CI-Pipeline. Die Rust-Pipeline stellt eine kompromittierte Binärdatei in einem Kubernetes-Cluster bereit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Angriff könnte in NPM beginnen, jedoch als kompilierte Binär-Backdoor in der produktiven Cloud-Infrastruktur enden. Das JavaScript-Sicherheitsteam wird ihn nicht entdecken, da er ihren Bereich sofort verlassen hat. Dem Cloud-Sicherheitsteam würde die Bedrohung ebenfalls nicht auffallen, da sie von einer vertrauenswürdigen CI-Pipeline unter Verwendung gültiger Anmeldedaten bereitgestellt wurde. Darauf müssen sich CISOs einstellen und entsprechende Vorkehrungen treffen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesetipp: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495329/cybersecurity-in-der-lieferkettewie-sie-ihre-software-supply-chain-schutzen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wie Sie Ihre Software-Supply-Chain schützen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="handlungsempfehlungen-fur-cisos"&gt;Handlungsempfehlungen für CISOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Handlungsempfehlungen für CISOs birgt der &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Informationen-und-Empfehlungen/Cyber_Resilience_Act/cyber_resilience_act_node.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).&lt;/a&gt; Er schreibt die Absicherung digitaler Produkte für Hersteller, Importeure und Händler vor, damit diese in sicheres Design bereits bei der Entwicklung, aber auch bei der Wartung investieren. Die dort formulierten Anforderungen müssen schrittweise bis Ende 2027 umgesetzt werden und umfassen auch die Sicherheit vernetzter Hardware und Software durch die Behandlung von Schwachstellen und deren Veröffentlichung, beziehungsweise Meldung an die zuständigen Behörden. Darüber hinaus müssen die drei genannten Akteure in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491814/sbom-erklart-was-ist-eine-software-bill-of-materials.html" target="_blank"&gt;SBOMs&lt;/a&gt; auch die Bestandteile der Software dokumentieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die nun in Kraft getretene &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090107/bundestag-beschliest-nis2-umsetzung.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS2&lt;/a&gt;-Richtlinie enthält ähnliche Anforderungen für KRITIS-Betreiber, die im NIS2-Umsetzungsgesetz (NIS2UmsuCG) und im KRITIS-Dachgesetz in Bezug auf Produkte und Lieferanten festgehalten werden. Einen lesenswerten Überblick gibt &lt;a href="https://www.openkritis.de/massnahmen/lieferanten_supply-chain_sicherheit-kritis-nis2.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OpenKRITIS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um sich vor Shai-Hulud und Co. zu schützen, sollten CISOs mit ihren Teams gemeinsam folgende Schritte umsetzen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sie müssen das „implizite Vertrauen“ in Identitäten beenden&lt;/strong&gt;. Bei den eingangs beschriebenen Szenarien um Shai-Hulud bestand das Problem darin, dass CI/CD-Systemen zu oft blind vertraut wird. Deshalb sollten CISOs dafür sorgen, dass ihre Teams einen kritischen Blick auf ihre Pipeline-Security werfen. CI/CD-Systeme dürfen nicht automatisch davon ausgehen, dass eine Aktivität legitim ist, nur weil sie mit einem gültigen Entwickler-Token signiert wurde. Sie müssen stattdessen den Identitätsschutz priorisieren. Es wurde bereits beobachtet, dass Angreifer gezielt Anmeldedaten wie NPM-Token und GitHub-Geheimnisse stehlen, um infizierte Pakete automatisch zu veröffentlichen. Maßnahmen zum Schutz dieser Identitäten muss daher oberste Priorität eingeräumt werden.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sicherheits-Silos sollten aufgelöst werden&lt;/strong&gt;. Viele Security-Aspekte laufen immer noch nicht in einem übergeordneten Management zusammen. Tools sowie Abteilungen der Application Security, Infrastructure Security, Cloud Security, Network Security und viele andere sorgen für zahlreiche Inseln im Meer der Security-Strategie. Sie alle müssen noch enger zusammenarbeiten und vom CISO koordiniert werden. Ein zentrales Risiko stellt die bereits beschriebene Polyglot-Supply Chain-Attacke dar, die diese Silos nahtlos durchbricht. Für CISOs gilt daher, ein abteilungs- und bereichsübergreifendes Monitoring einzuführen. Um die Gefahr nochmals zu verdeutlichen: Ein Angriff könnte bei einem JavaScript beginnen, sich über Build-Skripte fortsetzen und als Backdoor in der Cloud enden. Oftmals herrscht keine integrierte Sichtbarkeit, um all das nachzuvollziehen. Das JavaScript-Team sieht den Angriff nicht mehr, sobald er seinen Bereich verlässt, während das Cloud-Team der CI-Pipeline vertraut. CISOs müssen deshalb Systeme etablieren, die den gesamten Pfad über das Software Development zum Build bis zur Runtime hinweg überwachen. Abhilfe schaffen SBOMs, in denen die gesamte verwendete Software dokumentiert wird.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auf aktive Würmer vorbereiten und den Schutz von KI-Tools gewährleisten.&lt;/strong&gt; Für die Absicherung von KI-gestützten Risiken, gilt es, das Highjacking von KI-Tools und deren Manipulation zu verhindern. Zahlreiche Softwareentwickler arbeiten mit diesen Werkzeugen, um ihre Software zu schreiben. Sicherheitsforscher beobachten bereits, dass Angreifer Pakete einsetzen, die KI-Tools halluzinieren lassen. Aktive Würmer sind die nächste Stufe von Bedrohungen. Die Security-Strategie sollte deshalb über den Schutz vor Tippfehlern hinausgehen. Gefährdungen wie Shai-Hulud verbreiten sich wurmähnlich und exponentiell. Manuelle Prozesse zur Überprüfung von Paketen reichen bei dieser Geschwindigkeit nicht mehr aus. Diese Art von Supply-Chain-Würmern verfügt darüber hinaus über einen „Dead Man Switch“, der das System des Opfers löscht, wenn eine Analyse detektiert wird. CISOs sollten sicherstellen, dass Protokolle also auch außerhalb des Entwicklerrechners abgesichert werden, um bei einer forensischen Untersuchung die Spuren des Angriffs zu bewahren. (jm)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 10 vendors for AI-enabled security — according to CISOs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115785/top-10-vendors-for-ai-enabled-security-according-to-cisos.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Venture capital may be flowing to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080699/10-promising-cybersecurity-startups-cisos-should-know-about.html"&gt;trendy AI security startups&lt;/a&gt;, but battle-tested CISOs seem to be sticking with tried-and-true, name-brand technology partners for their AI-enabled security needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the key takeaway from &lt;a href="https://foundryco.com/research/security-priorities/"&gt;CSO’s 2025 Security Priorities Study&lt;/a&gt;, which collected responses from more than 640 senior security executives from across the globe. When asked to rank leaders in AI-powered security, the largest and most well-known security vendors topped CISOs’ lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The criteria CISOs used to rank industry leaders starts with product innovation. But CISOs also leaned heavily into practical matters, rather than flash and sizzle. The vendor’s reputation and whether they had been victimized by a high-profile breach was the second most important factor. Then came business value of the solution, cost/pricing, name recognition, vendor age, time to integrate the solution, and whether peers also use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity-market-report"&gt;Grandview Research points out&lt;/a&gt;, “The AI in cybersecurity industry is expanding due to the seamless integration of AI technologies with existing cybersecurity frameworks. Organizations prefer solutions that complement their current systems, ensuring minimal disruption and maximum efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also making a strong showing on the list were service providers, either full-on managed security service providers (MSSPs), cloud-based proxy services, or content delivery network providers that have expanded into cybersecurity. Clearly, CISOs are looking for ways to lift the burden of incident response off short-staffed and harried security teams.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the top 10 leaders in AI-enabled security in order of their ranking in our survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-cisco"&gt;1. Cisco&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: With its strong roots in networking, Cisco has an established foothold in the enterprise — and a stranglehold on the data that networking gear generates. The acquisitions of Duo Security (multifactor authentication and zero trust), Thousand Eyes (visibility), and Splunk (AI-powered SIEM), have enabled Cisco to integrate networking and security capabilities. Cisco recently launched AI Assistant for Security, an interface trained on massive security datasets to help analysts with event triage, root cause analysis, policy design, and simplifying firewall management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduced “Foundation-sec-8b-reasoning,” an AI foundational model designed to apply AI-powered reasoning to security tasks such as threat modeling, attack vector analysis, risk assessment, and security architecture evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; John Grady, principal analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group, says, “The AI era demands a transformative approach to security. Organizations need distributed, identity-based, zero trust protection for applications, users, AI models, and agents, supported by a unified policy framework. Cisco is in a very unique position to support this with its ability to embed advanced protections directly into the network.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-microsoft"&gt;2. Microsoft&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to Cisco, Microsoft is embedded in virtually every enterprise, and is also a vendor that has marshalled its considerable resources to build an AI-powered security ecosystem. The platform includes Microsoft Defender for securing cloud environments, Microsoft Sentinel for cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Purview for data governance, Microsoft Intune for endpoint management, Microsoft Entra for identity and access management, and Microsoft Defender XDR for threat detection and response. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Introduced Microsoft Security Copilot, a generative AI-powered security tool that helps increase the efficiency and capabilities of security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft visionary investment in OpenAI has paid off in catapulting Microsoft to a leadership position in the AI era. A new agreement inked in October cements Microsoft’s position as the key beneficiary of OpenAI Foundation’s research. The agreement gives Microsoft a 27% stake in OpenAI (valued at $135B), but more importantly it preserves Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI as its “frontier model partner.” Microsoft said its IP rights for both OpenAI’s models and products have been extended through 2032.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-google"&gt;3. Google&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Google has a well-deserved reputation as an innovator in cloud-based security services. Google is a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for SIEM. Gartner says, “Use of AI is a core competency for Google and its SecOps platform offers strong AI functionality throughout many of the common activities and functions associated with SIEM operations.” &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;IDC names Google a leader in its 2025 MarketScape for Worldwide Incident Response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves:&lt;/strong&gt; Announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3848035/alphabet-agrees-to-buy-israels-wiz-expanding-its-cloud-security-reach.html"&gt;buy cloud security platform vendor Wiz for $32B&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is expected to close in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Google offers a broad range of AI-powered security solutions, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3958409/google-launches-unified-enterprise-security-platform-announces-ai-security-agents.html"&gt;many based on its purchase of Mandiant&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. These include Google Threat Intelligence, Google Security Operations, Google Unified Security, Google AI protection, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4041892/new-security-features-beef-up-google-cloud-platform.html"&gt;Google Agentic SOC&lt;/a&gt;, which combines AI-driven automation with human expertise. Once the Wiz acquisition is finalized, Google will have expanded capabilities across multicloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-akamai-technologies"&gt;4. Akamai Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Akamai has successfully pivoted from being a content delivery network (CDN) provider to offering a platform for developing and running applications in the cloud, as well as providing a broad range of complementary cybersecurity services. These include web application and API protection (WaaP), Akamai firewall for AI, and zero trust security. In a recent evaluation conducted by SecureIQ Lab, Akamai outperformed competing vendors in a test of WaaP capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Akamai continues to aggressively build out its platform; key acquisitions include Linode, Neosec, and Noname Security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; IDC analyst Dave McCarthy says, “By extending compute capabilities to its vast network of over 4,400 locations across 134 countries, Akamai provides a differentiated value proposition in the crowded cloud market. This focus on low-latency, high-performance, and secure edge-native applications enables Akamai to avoid a direct, head-on confrontation with hyperscalers. Instead, it positions Akamai to cater to the growing demand for applications that require processing and data storage closer to the end user, thereby enhancing performance and security for distributed workloads.” The company recently launched Akamai Inference Cloud, a platform for securely distributing AI workloads across cloud and edge environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-ibm"&gt;5. IBM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Another gold standard name in the industry, IBM offers a broad range of managed security services that leverage the power of AI. The IBM portfolio includes IBM Guardium for AI-driven data security; Trusteer, which uses AI and machine learning for digital identity management; MaaS360 for AI-powered device security; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4010085/ibm-combines-governance-and-security-tools-to-solve-the-ai-agent-oversight-crisis.html"&gt;watsonx.governance for AI governance&lt;/a&gt;. IDC places IBM in the leader category of its MarketScape for worldwide managed detection and response (MDR). The crown jewel is IBM’s X-Force team of incident response experts. IDC says that IBM’s MDR leverages the X-Force protection platform, AI, contextual threat intelligence, and a global team operating in over 110 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves: &lt;/strong&gt;IBM inked a complex strategic partnership with Palo Alto Networks designed to enhance AI-powered security offerings for enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; The deal with Palo Alto Networks gives IBM the inside track on providing consulting services for Palo Alto customers. According to IDC’s MarketScape, IBM’s consulting services, which include incident readiness planning, risk assessments, security testing, and vulnerability assessments, are a key differentiator for enterprise customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-abnormal-ai"&gt;6. Abnormal AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite all the time, money, and effort poured into security, the one persistent vulnerability that seems most difficult to solve is social engineering attacks targeting email recipients. Enter Abnormal AI, which uses the power of AI, machine learning, and anomaly detection to analyze human behavior and protect end users from phishing and related email-centric attacks. Abnormal is a leader in the latest Forrester Wave for email, messaging, and collaboration security. And it is a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for email security.The company also offers phishing simulation training.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves: &lt;/strong&gt;The company was originally named Abnormal AI when it launched in 2018, but the market wasn’t ready for AI, so the company switched to Abnormal Security. Now, it has rebranded back to its original name, a reflection of market acceptance of AI-powered security solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook: &lt;/strong&gt;Abnormal AI is expanding beyond just email to a broader AI-driven platform. Says CEO Evan Reiser,“We started with email security because it was the biggest problem to solve at the time, and because it provides the richest data set of human behavior. Our goal is to become the most trusted and dependable AI in cybersecurity — one that protects people from the full spectrum of modern threats, utilizing AI to make decisions at superhuman speed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-crowdstrike"&gt;7. CrowdStrike&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: An innovator in cloud-native, AI-driven cybersecurity, CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform encompasses endpoint security, threat intelligence, and incident response, offered as a fully managed service. GigaOm rates CrowdStrike as a leader in its evaluation of autonomous SOC solutions. GigaOm cites CrowdStrike’s strength in AI-powered detection, unified EDR, next-generation SIEM, and SOAR, as well as agentic innovation with Charlotte AI. CrowdStrike is also a leader in Gartner’s analysis of endpoint protection platforms, and a leader in IDC’s MarketScape for cloud-native application protection platforms (CNAPP).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Acquired AI security vendor Pangea. The deal will enable CrowdStrike to extend its Falcon platform into AI detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook&lt;/strong&gt;: IDC points out that there is a push toward platformization in cybersecurity. “This is worthy of mention as CrowdStrike has a wide depth and breadth of capabilities built into its Falcon platform that provides the technology muscle for its MDR offering. The added capabilities, such as its managed cloud workload protection (CWP) for continuous runtime protection across hybrid and multicloud environments, workloads, and containers, and its fully managed identity threat protection service called Falcon Complete Identity Threat Protection provide expert management, monitoring, protection, and optimization of identities and identity stores.” IDC adds, “Organizations that are looking to consolidate their disparate technology point products into a unified managed platform should consider CrowdStrike.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-arctic-wolf"&gt;8. Arctic Wolf&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Arctic Wolf provides cloud-based MDR services with an open, flexible, vendor-neutral approach. The Arctic Wolf Platform ingests telemetry from the customer’s existing stack of security tools across endpoint, network, cloud, and identity. There’s no vendor lock-in when it comes to the organization’s choice of security tools. Arctic Wolf is a leader in the IDC MarketScape for MDR. IDC points out that Arctic Wolf addresses the problem of SOC analysts being overwhelmed by too many alerts with its ability to distill telemetry to a manageable number of tickets per day through the use of AI and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves:&lt;/strong&gt; Bought UpSight Security to accelerate the development of AI-powered ransomware protection and rollback capabilities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Arctic Wolf continues to evolve its platform to incorporate use of AI. Arctic Wolf recently introduced its AI Security Assistant, which allows for natural language interaction, enabling customers to ask questions and gain more context about their security environment. At the same time, the human element remains a key part of the Arctic Wolf service: The Arctic Wolf Concierge Security Team consists of security experts who analyze each customer’s security environment and business context and then provide advice on how to shore up security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-cloudflare"&gt;9. Cloudflare&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloudflare started out as a reverse-proxy CDN with a clear mission: securing the Internet. Over time, Cloudflare has leveraged its global footprint to deliver a broad range of cybersecurity services. The Cloudflare AI Security Suite offers a unified platform to secure workforce AI tools and public-facing applications, discover shadow AI, protect models from abuse, secure agent access, and prevent data exposure in prompts. Cloudflare is a leader in the 2025 Forrester Wave for Web application firewall services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves:&lt;/strong&gt; Cloudflare has acquired Replicate, a startup with software that makes it easier to deploy AI models in production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; The company’s lineup of AI-enhanced cybersecurity services includes AI-powered threat detection, bot management, encryption, email security, firewall, data loss protection, AI security posture management, and secure AI application development. In its latest quarter, revenue climbed 31% year over year, and analysts are predicting that Cloudflare will reach a $3B annual revenue run rate in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-broadcom"&gt;10. Broadcom&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Known primarily as a chipmaker that shook up the industry with &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/1248933/china-clears-broadcoms-69b-vmware-acquisition-allowing-deal-to-close.html"&gt;its purchase of VMware&lt;/a&gt;, Broadcom is also a vendor with deep connections to the enterprise through its acquisitions of management software leader CA Technologies and security vendor Symantec. Broadcom has combined the Carbon Black EDR technology that was part of the VMware deal with Symantec to create a new division — Enterprise Security Group. Broadcom also offers capabilities that cloud-based security vendors don’t, such as mainframe security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power moves&lt;/strong&gt;: Announced Symantec AI, a fully agentic assistant that leverages Symantec and Carbon Black capabilities to automatically respond to threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outlook: &lt;/strong&gt;Broadcom does a good job leveraging its alliances, particularly with Google Cloud. Broadcom supplies data center chips to Google, moves enterprise VMware workloads to Google cloud, incorporated Google’s Vertex AI development platform with Symantec AI, and uses Google Gemini models as the basis for its AI agents. Broadcom has also beefed up VMware security with AI enhancements to VMware vDefend lateral security and VMware AVI load balancer. Broadcom’s approach is to provide integrated security from silicon to software, using AI-driven analytics and automation to reduce the burden on security teams and stay ahead of evolving threats. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-security-vendors-leadership-vs-current-use"&gt;AI security vendors: Leadership vs. current use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One key point to note: This list represents the vendors that CISOs perceive as leaders, not necessarily the ones that they currently use for AI-enabled security. That top 10 list consists of Cisco and Microsoft in the top two spots, cited by 27% and 24% of respondents respectively. The next batch of vendors came in between 19% and 15%, so not necessarily a statistically significant difference. That group included Akamai, Abnormal, Broadcom, Google, Carbon Black, and Cloudflare. CrowdStrike (12%) and Check Point (11%) rounded out the top 10. So, basically the order is shaken up a bit, but the core list of vendors remains pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>For application security: SCA, SAST, DAST and MAST. What next?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115679/for-application-security-sca-sast-dast-and-mast-what-next.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have stared at enough scanner dashboards to recognize the pattern. SAST flags theoretical flaws that never execute. DAST shrugs because the route to the vulnerable function is blocked. SCA floods the zone with CVEs that never touch a hot path. MAST scolds my mobile app for secrets I retired last quarter. These tools are still essential, yet they now form a baseline rather than a destination. The next chapter is not another “silver bullet” product; it is a shift toward posture, provenance and proof.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chart: Posture, provenance and proof." class="wp-image-4115680" height="575" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/posture-provenance-proof.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Sunil Gentyala&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year the community has admitted the obvious: the battleground is the software supply chain and the running system, not only pre‑release scans. OWASP’s 2025 update elevated &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/A03_2025-Software_Supply_Chain_Failures/"&gt;software supply chain failures&lt;/a&gt; to A03, reframing vulnerable and outdated components as a systemic ecosystem risk that spans dependencies, build systems and distribution infrastructure (Endor Labs &lt;a href="https://www.endorlabs.com/learn/owasp-top-10-adds-a03-2025-software-supply-chain-failures"&gt;overview here&lt;/a&gt;). In parallel, CISA pushed SBOM guidance forward with a 2025 draft that demands richer, machine‑readable metadata and emphasizes automation for scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="posture-provenance-and-proof-the-new-trinity"&gt;Posture, provenance and proof: The new trinity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Application security posture management (ASPM) is the control plane that makes the old quartet useful again. Gartner’s 2025 Innovation Insight described how ASPM connects scattered signals across the SDLC, enforces policy and prioritizes based on context, such as reachability and exposure in practice, which means pulling SAST, DAST, SCA, IaC and runtime findings into a single view, then filtering for the small subset that really matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I prefer framing ASPM through a code to cloud lens because it mirrors how our systems actually work. The Wiz Academy guide lays out ASPM’s core capabilities, unified visibility, risk prioritization, policy enforcement and stresses continuous discovery across development, build and deployment. The goal is to cut alert fatigue while connecting code issues to runtime impact &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/academy/application-security-posture-management-aspm"&gt;ASPM&lt;/a&gt;. This aligns with Gartner’s premise but adds practical detail about correlating repository signals, pipeline policies and cloud reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Posture is the ‘what.’ Provenance is the ‘how’. The &lt;a href="https://slsa.dev/"&gt;SLSA&lt;/a&gt; framework gives us a shared vocabulary and verifiable controls to prove that artifacts were built by hardened, tamper‑resistant pipelines with signed attestations that downstream consumers can trust (OpenSSF &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/projects/slsa/"&gt;overview here&lt;/a&gt;). When I insist on SLSA Level 2 for most services and Level 3 for critical paths, I am not chasing compliance theater; I am buying integrity that survives audit and incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proof is where SBOMs finally grow up. Binding SBOM generation to the build that emits the deployable bits, signing them and validating at deploy time moves SBOMs from “ingredient lists” to enforceable controls. The CNCF TAG‑Security best &lt;a href="https://tag-security.cncf.io/community/working-groups/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper-v2/Software_Supply_Chain_Practices_whitepaper_v2.pdf"&gt;practices v2 paper&lt;/a&gt; is my practical map, personas, VEX for exploitability, cryptographic verification to ensure tests actually ran, and prescriptive guidance for cloud‑native factories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: if your SBOM describes developer intent rather than what executes, you will miss the next recall. Generate SBOMs from the build that produced the binary, sign them, ingest VEX and gate deployments on verification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-dashboards-to-decisions-aspm-in-practice"&gt;From dashboards to decisions: ASPM in practice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A posture program is a set of habits, not just a platform. I start by unifying scanner outputs into a single risk register, but I refuse to triage in a vacuum. Findings must carry reachability evidence, data sensitivity tags and exposure context. That is where ASPM earns its keep. The Wiz Academy material underscores this code to cloud connection and shows how to reduce noise so developers see the few issues that block business rather than a wall of theoretical risk. Gartner’s framing makes the case for adoption in regulated environments where fragmented signals undermine remediation velocity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two implementation notes from my own programs. First, wire ASPM to owners. Every finding needs a resolver and an SLA, or it is just a report. Second, gate risky builds. Policy enforcement is not a dashboard; it is a decision. If an artifact lacks provenance or a VEX shows exploitability in a reachable path, it does not ship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: Keep one policy source of truth. If security policy lives in three tools, developers will ignore all three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chain-rigor-without-theater"&gt;Supply chain rigor without theater&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supply chain work can degrade into paperwork if we forget what matters. Integrity is the point. I keep SLSA simple. Level 2 quickly, Level 3 for critical paths. That means a hardened build service, isolated builds, signed provenance and a verified chain from source to artifact.  SBOMs become operational once they are machine-readable, signed and validated on deploy. &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-08/2025_CISA_SBOM_Minimum_Elements.pdf"&gt;CISA’s&lt;/a&gt; 2025 draft tightened expectations for fields, formats and automation, which I welcome because it makes procurement and incident response faster and cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/reports/public-sector-software-supply-chain-whitepaper/"&gt;CNCF paper&lt;/a&gt; fills in the gaps. It explains how to couple SBOMs with VEX, add cryptographic checks for pipeline steps, and treat developer infrastructure as part of the supply chain. That last point matters because attackers increasingly target repositories, CI settings and artifact registries, not just code dependencies. Public sector guidance from CNCF echoes the same priorities for government workloads, with concrete lessons from SolarWinds, Log4Shell and xz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: never accept a vendor SBOM without a signature and a provenance attestation. If they cannot prove how the software was built, your risk calculus is guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="runtime-reality-instruments-not-illusions"&gt;Runtime reality: Instruments, not illusions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prerelease testing is necessary but not sufficient. IAST instrumentation gives me runtime truth during QA, observing actual execution paths to reduce false positives and preserve developer context. In production, the mental model shifts to RASP, which blocks exploitation inside the application at the exact moment risky operations occur: SQL construction, OS exec, serialization, where WAFs cannot see. This is not a knock on WAFs; it is a recognition that network layer inspection and application layer introspection solve different problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think perimeter controls are enough, two weeks in November 2025 should dispel that. CISA issued emergency guidance for Cisco ASA and FTD vulnerabilities (CVE‑2025‑20333, CVE‑2025‑20362) because agencies reported devices as “patched” that were still on vulnerable trains. The directive prescribed minimum versions, forensic checks and timelines, and reminded everyone that all devices must be updated, not only Internet‑facing ones (CISA &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-identifies-ongoing-cyber-threats-cisco-asa-and-firepower-devices"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lesson is portable: treat “patched” as a state with proofs. Validate minimum release trains, verify fleet‑wide and decommission end‑of‑support gear. Pair perimeter controls with application‑layer sensors and container runtime protection because your workloads increasingly live in Kubernetes and managed platforms. &lt;a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/kubernetes-market"&gt;Market analyses&lt;/a&gt; confirm the shift toward orchestrated, cloud‑native estates where consistent runtime policy is possible (CNCF trend post &lt;a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/01/22/kubernetes-in-2025-are-you-ready-for-these-top-5-trends-and-predictions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: wire runtime telemetry to your TDIR practice. When RASP blocks an injection in production, that event should spawn code fixes, not just a closed alert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="securing-ai-and-the-supply-chain-ecosystems"&gt;Securing AI and the supply chain ecosystems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the nexts, AI is the most mercurial. NIST’s final 2025 guidance on adversarial ML split threats across PredAI and GenAI and called out prompt injection in direct and indirect form as the dominant exploit in agentic systems where trusted instructions co mingle with untrusted data (&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-prompt-injection-nist-report"&gt;Meritak Overview;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-prompt-injection-nist-report"&gt;IBM explainer&lt;/a&gt;). The U.S. AI Safety Institute published work on agent hijacking evaluations, which I treat as required red‑team reading for anyone delegating actions to tools (&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/01/technical-blog-strengthening-ai-agent-hijacking-evaluations" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST AISI blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For builders, the July 2024 NIST SP 800‑218A community profile extends SSDF into generative AI and dual-use foundation models. It covers threat modeling prompts, securing training data pipelines, isolating model operations and binding model documentation to secure development practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the language layer an unfashionable recommendation turned mainstream. In June 2025 NSA and CISA urged adoption of memory‑safe languages with pragmatic migration guidance for legacy estates—start where it matters most, integrate incrementally and shield old modules behind hardened FFI (&lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/23/2003742198/-1/-1/0/CSI_MEMORY_SAFE_LANGUAGES_REDUCING_VULNERABILITIES_IN_MODERN_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT.PDF" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NSA/CISA CSI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="language-choices-that-erase-entire-bug-classes"&gt;Language choices that erase entire bug classes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to delete vulnerability classes, stop writing them. In June 2025, NSA and CISA published a joint CSI urging adoption of memory-safe languages with pragmatic migration guidance for legacy estates. Start where it matters, integrate incrementally and shield old modules behind hardened FFI. This is not academic posturing. Buffer overflows, use after free and data races erode resilience and cost real money. Memory-safe languages reduce those risks by design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Advisory: mandate memory-safe languages for net new development, plan migrations for high-risk modules and publish a runway with dates and metrics. Explain the why using NSA and CISA guidance, then measure the results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-sca-sast-dast-and-mast-fit-now"&gt;Where SCA, SAST, DAST and MAST fit now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They remain foundational when docked into a posture‑centric program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SAST still catches design and implementation flaws, but I insist on reachability analysis and developer‑first remediation inside the IDE; feed SAST into ASPM for context so theoretical issues do not overwhelm real ones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;DAST is indispensable for pre‑release exposure, yet I pair it with IAST to observe live code paths and reduce false positives.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;SCA moves beyond CVE lists when SBOM generation binds to builds and VEX cuts noise; CNCF best practices and CISA’s 2025 SBOM draft describe how to do this well.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;MAST keeps mobile hardening honest, but I roll secret hygiene and secure storage checks into the same lifecycle controls used for server apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leadership-advisory-what-i-implement-next"&gt;Leadership advisory: what I implement next&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the operating model I have shipped in regulated environments that cannot afford to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASPM as control plane.&lt;/strong&gt; Unify signals, deduplicate and rank by exploitability—reachability, exposure, data sensitivity. Route ownership automatically and use policy gates on risky builds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain rigor.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt SLSA levels, require signed SBOMs and attestations, and validate at deploy. No artifact without provenance, no deploy without verification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime protection.&lt;/strong&gt; Embed RASP in application stacks, enforce container runtime controls and keep WAF at the edge. Wire events to your TDIR pipeline so blocking in production triggers fixes in code.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets lifecycle and machine identities.&lt;/strong&gt; Central vaulting, automated rotation, least privilege everywhere, mutual TLS for service‑to‑service authentication.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI security program.&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt NIST SP 800‑218A, red‑team agents for hijacking, enforce privilege separation and monitor outputs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language policy&lt;/strong&gt;. Mandate memory‑safe languages for net‑new development, plan migrations for high‑risk modules and use NSA/CISA’s guidance to educate stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCA, SAST, DAST and MAST remain the bedrock, but they are most effective when orchestrated by ASPM, proven by SLSA and SBOMs, and defended by runtime controls. Add AI-specific safeguards and memory‑safe languages, and you move from chasing findings to making decisions with confidence. That is my “what next.”&lt;/p&gt;
