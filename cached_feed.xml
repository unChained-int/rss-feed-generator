      <title>Drilling Down on Uncle Sam’s Proposed TP-Link Ban</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link>
      <description>The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from TP-Link Systems, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link's ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.</description>

      <description>The criminal use of cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly professionalised, but so too is the global response. Participants at the 9th Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptoassets emphasised three priorities: developing common standards, deepening cooperation and investing in capacity. These are essential if authorities and industry are to keep pace with evolving threats and recover illicit cryptoassets at scale.</description>

      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <title>Nikkei’s Slack breach leaks sensitive data from more than 17,000 users</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086100/nikkeis-slack-breach-leaks-sensitive-data-from-more-than-17000-users.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japanese media company Nikkei has confirmed that a security breach of its Slack accounts has potentially leaked highly sensitive information from more than 17,000 of its users. Consultants point to the incident as yet another reminder of the dangers when non-corporate devices are allowed to access confidential corporate data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An employee’s personal computer was infected with a virus, leading to the leakage of Slack authentication credentials. It is believed that this information was used to gain unauthorized access to employee accounts,” Nikkei said in &lt;a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/news/announcements/1394.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a published statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The incident was identified in September and countermeasures such as changing passwords were implemented. Potentially leaked information includes the names, email addresses, and chat histories for 17,368 individuals registered on Slack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei statement added “Considering the incident’s significance and to ensure transparency, we voluntarily reported it to [Japan’s] &lt;a href="https://www.ppc.go.jp/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Personal Information Protection Commission&lt;/a&gt;. No leakage of information related to sources or reporting activities has been confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity consultant &lt;a href="https://formergov.com/directory/brianlevine" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, a directory of former government and military specialists, stressed that this is part of an ongoing trend of Slack breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is often increased risk when employees or contractors access company resources from non-company-managed devices. Recent attacks against Okta, MGM Resorts, and others have been linked to such unmanaged access,” Levine said, adding that last year, “an attacker exfiltrated more than [1 terabyte] of internal data from Disney’s Slack environment when a contractor had accessed Slack from an unmanaged device, bypassing monitoring tools.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/erik-avakian" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group, noted that one of the most concerning things about attacks similar to the Nikkei breach is that the attackers are often able to easily bypass MFA defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An employee’s computer gets hit by malware designed to steal credentials. The malware grabs Slack session tokens and cookies, then sends them to attacker command and control servers,” Avakian said. “With those stolen and likely active tokens, the attacker is able to log into Slack from their own device and access private channels and chat history without even triggering a multi-factor authentication prompt, since they reused an already-authenticated session.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avakian said that the nature of these attacks suggests that enterprise CISOs should consider procedural changes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This kind of attack would give threat actors “broad access to channels and integrations, which made the impact worse. Weaknesses around this incident shine a light on unmanaged or poorly protected devices, long-lived tokens, and not enough logging or alerts for suspicious sessions,” Avakian said. “Organizations can learn from these types of incident, and those using Slack, or any other widely used communications platform similar to Slack, should maintain a policy for revoking active sessions and refreshing tokens for affected users routinely, forcing password resets and rotating API tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyeman/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Man&lt;/a&gt;, a senior information security consultant with Online Business Systems, pointed out, “the larger discussion should be on the failings of the Nikkei IT/IS program to protect against some sort of attack that targeted its employees. Why are employees allowed to use Slack on personal devices?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So this is really an issue of risk management,” Man said. “In the case of Nikkei, it appears the exploitation was elsewhere [on the system]. The initial access allowed the miscreants to use credentials to gain access to Slack. That’s not a compromise of Slack itself, that’s a compromise of employee account authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thecyberdr.com/#about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Boyce&lt;/a&gt;, security consultant and CEO of The Cyber Dr., said the Nikkei incident represents “what happens when someone uses a personal device to get into work systems. Once that device gets hit with malware, it’s game over for the credentials. The part that worries me is this could happen anywhere. People forget how much sensitive stuff ends up in Slack: messages, files, links, sometimes even credentials. Once someone has that, they can poke around pretty freely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, it’s just another reminder that zero trust has to go all the way out to the edge, not just the network. You’ve got to know the device, use MFA tied to managed hardware, and control what data lives in those SaaS tools,” Boyce said. “You may be also asking ‘Well, do we do away with BYOD all together?’ And the short answer is ‘no’ but we do need to look at ways we can secure the workforce beyond company issued assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-chargeback-43-million-cardholders-affected-eur-300-million-in-damages</link>
      <description>On 4 November 2025, an international coordinated action day targeted three major fraud and money laundering networks as part of Operation “Chargeback.” Led by the Cybercrime Department (Landeszentralstelle Cybercrime) of the General Prosecutor's Office (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) in Koblenz, Germany, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the operation has been investigating these networks since December 2020. More than 60 house searches were conducted and a total of 18 arrest warrants executed. The criminal networks are suspected of misusing credit card data from over 4.3 million cardholders across 193 countries. In total, the estimated damage from the fraud scheme exceeds EUR 300 million, with attempted damages amounting to over EUR 750 million.</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

Die wesentlichen limitierenden Faktoren für CISOs sind dabei in aller Regel:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;das Budget sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;nicht eindeutige Verantwortlichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesem Artikel stellen wir Ihnen zehn essenzielle Maßnahmen für (mehr) physische Sicherheit vor, die CISOs auf dem Zettel haben sollten. Zunächst werfen wir jedoch einen kurzen Blick darauf, wie sich physische Security definiert – und warum sie von entscheidender Bedeutung für Unternehmen ist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="warum-physische-security-wichtig-ist"&gt;Warum physische Security wichtig ist&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Begriff der physischen Sicherheit umfasst per Definition den Schutz von Personen, Eigentum und physischen Assets vor unberechtigtem Zugriff, Diebstahl und sonstigen Handlungen die zu Schaden oder Verlust führen. Dieser Bereich wird allzu oft zugunsten der Cybersicherheit vernachlässigt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für CISOs ist der Bereich vor allem deshalb so wichtig, weil die allermeisten modernen, physischen Sicherheitssysteme respektive -kontrollen auf irgendeine Art und Weise mit der IT verknüpft sind – von Badges und Keycards bis hin zur Videoüberwachung. Kommt es zu einem unberechtigten (physischen) Zugriff, können daraus in der Folge zudem auch &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3577944/diese-unternehmen-hats-schon-erwischt.html" target="_blank" title="Cyberangriffe und Data Breaches"&gt;Cyberangriffe und Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt; erwachsen. Es sollte deshalb im Interesse eines jeden Sicherheitsentscheiders liegen, entsprechende Vorkehrungen zu treffen, um den Zugriff auf diese Assets zu kontrollieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das soll (und kann) nicht heißen, CISOs mit sämtlichen Tasks physischer Security zu betrauen. Zwar funktioniert es im Fall einiger kleinerer Unternehmen, die Rolle des CISO und des CSO zusammenzulegen – für viele große Unternehmen ist das jedoch keine Option, wie Max Shier, CISO beim Cyberrisk-Spezialisten Optiv, erklärt: “Wenn behördliche Auflagen bestehen oder es um größere Unternehmen geht, ergibt es unter Umständen keinen Sinn, die Bereiche Cybersecurity und physische Sicherheit zusammenzulegen. Die resultierenden Verantwortlichkeiten – etwa, sich um einen Wachdienst für Produktionsanlagen oder Bodyguards für Führungskräfte zu kümmern -, könnten Cybersecurity-Teams je nach Auslastung und Kapazität &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495078/gestresste-security-mitarbeiter-droht-eine-kundigungswelle.html" target="_blank" title="schnell überfordern"&gt;schnell überfordern&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sollte diese Option auch für Sie entfallen, weiß Howard Taylor, CISO beim Security-Dienstleister Radware, was zu tun ist: “Dann ist die Kommunikation und Koordination mit den physischen Sicherheitsteams für CISOs entscheidend, um ihre Ziele zu erreichen. Diese sollten in die Planungsprozesse für &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493151/resilienz-business-continuity-planung-ist-alles.html" target="_blank" title="Business Continuity"&gt;Business Continuity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495970/die-besten-cyber-recovery-anbieter.html" target="_blank" title="Disaster Recovery"&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/a&gt; sowie physische Anlagen und Einrichtungen einbezogen werden. Zusätzlich muss auch sichergestellt sein, dass die resultierenden, physischen Maßnahmen aus rechtlicher Sicht einwandfrei sind – etwa, dass Aufnahmen von Überwachungskameras keine Datenschutzregularien verletzen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-top-ten-physischer-sicherheitsmanahmen"&gt;Die Top Ten physischer Sicherheitsmaßnahmen&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ganz unabhängig von der jeweiligen Organisationsstruktur sollten CISOs mit allen Stakeholdern im Bereich physische Sicherheit kollaborieren. Folgende zehn Maßnahmen sollten Sie diesbezüglich vor allem auf dem Schirm haben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. IT-Einrichtungen und Rechenzentren härten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rechenzentren, sensible IT-Einrichtungen und Computerräume in Mehrzweckbüros sind offensichtliche Bereiche, auf die CISOs ihr Augenmerk legen sollten, um die Kontrolle über den physischen Zugang zu gewährleisten. David Ortiz, CISO beim Konsumgüter-Unternehmen Church &amp;amp; Dwight, spezifiziert: “Sicherheitsentscheider sollten dafür Sorge tragen, dass der Zugang zu sämtlichen Räumen mit technischem Equipment auf die Personen beschränkt wird, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493543/was-ist-privileged-access-management.html" target="_blank" title="die ihn benötigen"&gt;die ihn benötigen&lt;/a&gt;. Zudem sollten Auftragnehmer ausschließlich in Begleitung Zugang zu solchen Räumlichkeiten erhalten. Idealerweise wird der Zugang protokolliert und täglich überprüft.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natürlich sollten die zu ergreifenden Maßnahmen je nach Einrichtung und ihrer Risikolage variiert und angepasst werden, empfiehlt Justin Fier, Senior Vice President of Red Team Operations beim Sicherheitsanbieter Darktrace: “Sämtliche Einrichtungen, die kritische Informationen beherbergen, sollten strengere Sicherheitskontrollen aufweisen, als solche die für weniger sensible Assets genutzt werden. CISOs müssen deshalb in erster Linie wissen, welche Daten und Ressourcen wo gespeichert und genutzt werden, das Risiko bestimmen, das im Fall eines unberechtigten Eindringens ensteht – und anschließend die physischen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen bei Bedarf entsprechend verstärken.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Risiken im Büroalltag erkennen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um sich Zugang zu Unternehmensnetzwerken zu verschaffen, nehmen kriminelle Angreifer auch ganz alltägliche Office-Settings ins Visier. Jeder Netzwerkanschluss könne so zu einem potenziellen Einfallstor in die IT-Umgebung werden, warnt Will Bass, Vice President Cybersecurity beim Rechenzentrumsspezialisten Flexential. Sein Rat an CISOs: “Setzen Sie sich intensiv mit der physischen Sicherheitsarchitektur und den Standards für alle Einrichtungen auseinander – unabhängig davon, ob es sich um sensible Facilities handelt oder nicht. Nur so können Sie sicherstellen, die richtigen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492407/ot-security-so-schutzen-sie-ihre-industrieanlagen.html" target="_blank" title="Defense-in-Depth-Maßnahmen"&gt;Defense-in-Depth-Maßnahmen&lt;/a&gt; einzusetzen und unbefugten, physischen Zugriff zu verhindern.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Optiv-CISO Shier ergänzt, dass das auch in Zeiten von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492755/incident-reporting-wie-sich-remote-work-auf-die-meldung-von-sicherheitsvorfallen-auswirkt.html" target="_blank" title="Remote- und Hybrid Work"&gt;Remote- und Hybrid Work&lt;/a&gt; relevant sei: “Trotzdem die Büros in vielen Fällen inzwischen weniger frequentiert sind, müssen Sicherheitsentscheider gewährleisten, dass Bürogebäude mit angemessenen physischen Sicherheitskontrollen ausgestattet sind. Drahtlose Zugangspunkte, Zugangskontrollen mit Ausweisen und Videoüberwachung sind weiterhin relevant und sollten keinesfalls unter den Tisch fallen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Laterale Bewegungen in physischen Räumen ausschließen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn es darum geht, den Zugang zu Unternehmen physisch abzusichern, sollten CISOs außerdem ein Augenmerk darauf legen, ob sich Angreifer lateral durch physische Sperrzonen bewegen können. Alethe Denis, Senior Security Consultant beim Sicherheitsanbieter Bishop Fox, erklärt: “Hat sich ein Angreifer erst einmal Zugang zu Sperrbereichen verschafft, sinkt die Wahrscheinlichkeit aufzufliegen, drastisch. Schließlich gehen die allermeisten Menschen davon aus, dass Personen, die sich in Sperrbereichen aufhalten, zuvor eine Zugangskontrolle durchlaufen und bestanden haben.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ebenso wie Unternehmen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491997/cyberresilienz-mikrosegmentierung-ruckt-in-den-fokus.html" target="_blank" title="Netzwerksegmentierung"&gt;Netzwerksegmentierung&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank" title="Zero-Trust-Prinzipien"&gt;Zero-Trust-Prinzipien&lt;/a&gt; einsetzten, um Netzwerkressourcen zu schützen, sollten sie auch im Bereich physische Security vorgehen, fordert die Sicherheitsexpertin: “Im Idealfall verhindern Treppenhäuser und Aufzüge mit Authentifizierungserfordernis sowie aufmerksame Mitarbeiter, dass es zu ‘Tailgaiting’ und einem möglichen Schaden für das Unternehmen kommt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Assets in Colocation- und Cloud-Umgebungen schützen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Adlerauge der Sicherheitsentscheider ist aber nicht nur gefragt, wenn es um unternehmenseigene Lokalitäten geht. Auch &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2815781/so-funktioniert-ein-rechenzentrum.html" target="_blank" title="Colocation-Facilities oder -Rechenzentren"&gt;Colocation-Facilities oder -Rechenzentren&lt;/a&gt; sollten diesbezüglich berücksichtigt werden, fordert Shier: “Sollten Sie zum Beispiel ein Rechenzentrum mit anderen Unternehmen teilen, tun Sie gut daran, auch einzelne Serverracks abzusichern – etwa mit integrierten Ausweislesegeräten. Zudem ist es essenziell, Rechenzentren mit Kameras, Wachpersonal und weiteren Kontrollmaßnahmen auszustatten.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Selbst wenn die physische Handhabung von Systemen vollständig von der Organisation abstrahiert sei – wie bei Public-Cloud- oder SaaS-Ressourcen – müssten CISOs dennoch darauf achten, wie diese Systeme physisch kontrolliert werden, ist Mike Pedrick, Vice President of Cybersecurity Consulting beim Managed-Service-Provider Nuspire, überzeugt: “Solche Offerings entbinden CISOs nicht von ihrer Verantwortung. Wenn überhaupt, setzt es sie zusätzlich unter Druck, die Bedeutung von Verträgen und Service Level Agreements sowie den Wert eines erfolgreichen &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2761566/10-wege-in-die-it-audit-hoelle.html" target="_blank" title="Audits"&gt;Audits&lt;/a&gt; durch Dritte zu schätzen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Physische Cyber-Verbindungen analysieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs, die in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492064/it-sicherheit-in-kritis-unternehmen-unsichtbar-ist-unschutzbar.html" target="_blank" title="Kritis-Organisationen"&gt;Kritis-Organisationen&lt;/a&gt; tätig sind, sollten sich nicht nur Gedanken darüber machen, wie sich physische Handlungen auf die Cyberumgebung auswirken können. Sie müssen auch dazu in der Lage sein, einzuschätzen, wie sich Aktivitäten im Cyberraum auf physische Umgebungen auswirken könnten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cyberangriffe auf industrielle Umgebungen können eine erhebliche Bedrohung für die physische Sicherheit darstellen”, konstatiert Almog Apirion, Mitbegründer des Remote-Access-Anbieters Cyolo. Angesichts der heutigen Konvergenz von IT- und OT-Umgebungen sollten CISOs jedoch generell – also auch wenn sie nicht im Kritis-Bereich tätig sind – sämtliche Verbindungspunkte zwischen dem physischen und dem Cyberraum im Blick haben. So fielen zum Beispiel auch physische Industrieanlagen in den Bereich des CISO, wenn diese remote gesteuert respektive gemanagt werden könnten, gibt Apirion zu bedenken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. IoT-Gerätschaften berücksichtigen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein weiterer Aspekt der physischen Security steht mit &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492217/tuv-sud-diese-sicherheitsstandards-gelten-im-iot.html" target="_blank" title="IoT-Devices"&gt;IoT-Devices&lt;/a&gt; in Zusammenhang. Flexential-Manager Bass erklärt: “IoT-Geräte befinden sich oft in frei zugänglichen Bereichen – wie etwa Überwachungskameras an der Außenseite eines Gebäudes. Der physische Zugang zu einem solchen Device ist ein potenzieller Einstiegspunkt. Zu verhindern, dass es dazu kommt, erfordert spezifische Schutzmaßnahmen und kann zur Herausforderung gereichen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Radware-CISO Taylor weist darauf hin, dass IoT-Gerätschaften wie OT-Systeme unter Umständen essenzielle Funktionen im physischen Raum steuern: “IoT-Systeme stellen eine Brücke zwischen Information und Aktion dar. Das macht sie im Rahmen physischer Angriffe zu einem attraktiven Ziel.” Der Sicherheitsentscheider appelliert deshalb, bei solchen Devices auf integrierte Monitoring-Funktionalitäten zu achten, um unbefugte Manipulationen von Software oder &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493727/proofpoint-report-zu-ta547-ki-gestutzte-malware-zielt-auf-deutsche-unternehmen.html" target="_blank" title="Malware-Befall"&gt;Malware-Befall&lt;/a&gt; zu verhindern. Er ergänzt: “Für den Fall, dass jemand das IoT-Gerät zerstört, sollte zudem ein Notfallplan existieren.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Remote-Devices sperren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Netzwerkrand hat sich im Laufe der Zeit verändert. Für CISOs bedeutet das: Sie müssen auf Bedrohungsmodelle und Kontrollmaßnahmen setzen, die im jeweiligen Kontext ihres Unternehmens Sinn ergeben und ein akzeptables Risikolevel realisieren. Dazu sollten Security Stakeholder und Supply-Chain-Partner zusammenarbeiten, um die Integrität der Hardware sicherzustellen und der Belegschaft Security Best Practices an die Hand zu geben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die neue Arbeitswelt hat dabei das Problem der verteilten Gerätschaften weiter verstärkt, wie Darktrace-Sicherheitsexperte Fier erklärt: “Wegen der Popularität von Remote und Hybrid Work wird es für CISOs zunehmend herausfordernder, physische IT-Ressourcen abzusichern. Schließlich nutzen die Mitarbeiter ihre Geräte an vielen verschiedenen Orten, was grundsätzlich das Risiko von Verlust, Diebstahl und Missbrauch erhöht. Das Homeoffice hilft an dieser Stelle auch nicht – in diesem Fall müssen CISOs sich auch damit befassen, wie etwa Router im Homeoffice abgesichert sind.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Fier nehmen kriminelle Hacker zunehmend solche Devices ins Visier. Sein Tipp, um Abhilfe zu schaffen: “Erwägen Sie, Personen, die für Angreifer von besonderem Interesse sein könnten – etwa &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491663/executive-cyber-protection-8-tools-um-entscheider-zu-schutzen.html" target="_blank" title="Führungskräfte und Administratoren"&gt;Führungskräfte und Administratoren&lt;/a&gt; – mit speziell abgesicherter Hardware auszustatten.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Auf integrierte Access Control setzen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Facility Teams sind für die alltäglichen Administrationsaufgaben in Zusammenhang mit physischen Zugangskontrollen – und der Gebäudesicherheit im Allgemeinen – zuständig. Diesbezüglich empfiehlt es sich allerdings, Sicherheitsentscheider einzubeziehen, wie Church &amp;amp; Dwight CISO Ortiz vorschlägt: “Ein CISO sollte mit den Teams für physische Sicherheit zusammenarbeiten, um die Risikolage physischer Zugangskontrollen zu durchdringen. Das beinhaltet zum Beispiel zu wissen, ob der Zugang zu einer Einrichtung durch einen Empfangsbereich gesichert wird, per Badge erfolgt oder ob Videoüberwachungssysteme im Einsatz sind. Zudem sollten die Zugangssysteme auf verdächtige Aktivitäten überprüft werden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Manager ist davon überzeugt, dass CISOs auch einen Beitrag dazu leisten sollten, die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495114/identity-access-managementdie-9-besten-iam-tools.html" target="_blank" title="Access-Control-Maßnahmen"&gt;Access-Control-Maßnahmen&lt;/a&gt; mitzugestalten und in logische Zugangskontrollen zu integrieren. “Physische und logische Zugangskontrollen müssen Hand in Hand gehen. Das gilt insbesondere, wenn Zugangsdaten verlorengehen oder Mitarbeiter entlassen werden”, hält Ortiz fest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Überwachungssysteme (und deren Daten) absichern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Videoüberwachungssysteme zu monitoren, fällt ebenfalls nicht ins native Zuständigkeitsgebiet von CISOs. Trotzdem sollten Sicherheitsentscheider ein Interesse daran haben, mitzureden, wenn es darum geht, diese Systeme zu designen und abzusichern. Schließlich sind sie in der Regel die Spezialisten, wenn es um &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492710/governance-risk-compliance-grc-adaptiver-ansatz-fur-das-risk-management.html" target="_blank" title="Datenschutz und Compliance"&gt;Datenschutz und Compliance&lt;/a&gt; geht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In Anbetracht der unterschiedlichen Datenschutzbedenken, der gesetzlichen Verpflichtungen und anderer Aspekte, die mit einer Videoüberwachung einhergehen, sollten CISOs eine tragende Rolle einnehmen, wenn es darum geht, diese Systeme zu managen”, bestätigt Darktrace-Manager Fier und fügt hinzu: “Dazu müssen sie eng mit den relevanten Teams, beispielsweise der Rechtsabteilung, zusammenarbeiten und sicherstellen, dass die jeweils geltenden Gesetze und Datenschutzvorschriften eingehalten werden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Davon abgesehen seien moderne CCTV-Systeme auch Teil der IT-Umgebung – vergrößerten also die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495294/schwachstellen-managen-die-6-besten-vulnerability-management-tools.html" target="_blank" title="Cyberangriffsfläche von Unternehmen"&gt;Cyberangriffsfläche von Unternehmen&lt;/a&gt;, erklärt Jonathan Sword, Director der Security-Beratung Agility Cyber: “Es ist üblich, dass die Überwachungskameras von Bürogebäuden mit dem Hauptnetzwerk des Unternehmens verbunden sind. Sie sind also für andere Benutzer im Netzwerk einsehbar – und damit potenziell auch für Bedrohungsakteurre, die sich Zugang verschafft haben.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Überwachungsdaten bereithalten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Essenziell ist für CISOs und ihre &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494979/was-ist-ein-incident-response-retainer.html" target="_blank" title="Incident-Response"&gt;Incident-Response&lt;/a&gt;-Teams schließlich auch, jederzeit auf den Output dieser Überwachungssysteme zugreifen zu können. Das Ziel ist dabei, mit Hilfe der Überwachungsaufnahmen Aktivitäten in physischen Räumen schnell und einfach mit Aktionen logischer Systeme zu verknüpfen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bishop-Fox-Security-Expertin Denis erklärt: “Wenn es zu einem Angriff kommt, bei dem Daten gefährdet sein könnten und das Überwachungsmaterial Erkenntnisse zum Status der Attacke geben kann, sollte das IT-Sicherheitsteam auch auf diese Daten zugreifen können.” (fm)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CISOs must prove the business value of cyber — the right metrics can help</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4083604/why-cybersecurity-leaders-find-important-to-prove-the-business-value-of-cyber.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most organizations, cybersecurity has always been seen as a cost center rather than a business enabler or revenue driver. Executives perceive cybersecurity as a necessary evil that pulls funds away from more important, income-generating functions like marketing and product development, even though cybersecurity budgets only amount to a small fraction of these costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This perception has only grown more acute over the years, even as CISOs gain &lt;a href="https://foundryco.com/research/security-priorities/"&gt;access to their boards&lt;/a&gt; and CEO’s. Which is why, in multiple studies, including one &lt;a href="https://www.opentext.com/en/media/report/opentext-ponemon-institute-the-challenges-to-ensuring-information-is-secure-compliant-and-ready-for-ai-report-en.pdf"&gt;from Ponemon Institute and Open Text&lt;/a&gt;, security leaders consider “using metrics to demonstrate the business value of the IT security program to the business” as their top priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But getting the right metrics using language and benchmarks that business leaders can assimilate doesn’t come easy to most cyber security leaders, especially for CISOs who hail from technical backgrounds, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="champion-an-enterprise-risk-management-function"&gt;Champion an enterprise risk management function&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity leaders who report up to the IT department in organizations that lack a proper enterprise risk management (ERM) function have a particularly hard time proving value, according to Michael S. Oberlaender, a CISO with 25 years of experience who’s authored &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.amazon.com_stores_Michael-2DS.-2DOberlaender_author_B089VRNY1D-3Fref-3Dap-5Frdr-26isDramIntegrated-3Dtrue-26shoppingPortalEnabled-3Dtrue-26ccs-5Fid-3Dbdadbadb-2Ddd8b-2D4460-2D9667-2D521ea725d28f&amp;amp;d=DwMDaQ&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=FhzNOV771x7FFYofbEAl7x_fq_SZVE0HhYPi1TmF3d8&amp;amp;m=fnk0UsAFVrOpWzXmMt1yhfVNRIRFDiNJ33Qbb9vw3DEoK0zMHB6iRGlACxxLubXW&amp;amp;s=C7BhSftVnUWHt3pdORA6CJ9qpTY8hGZDelIN5pleRek&amp;amp;e="&gt;several books&lt;/a&gt; on CISO leadership. His writings are based on experiences working with boards and the C-suite devising and tracking cyber security metrics within the ERM function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At several companies I’ve worked for I’ve had to help them create an enterprise risk management function. To do that, I find great allies among the business leaders and work with them to align cyber risk with business priorities,” Oberlaender notes. “In other cases, I use and maintain a documented risk register and present that in my regular board meetings — here are the metrics within our assigned and managed risks and here are the risks we have not yet decided upon.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a foundational ERM program, and by aligning metrics to business priorities, cybersecurity leaders can ultimately prove the value of the cyber security function. Useful metrics examples in business terms include maturity, compliance, risk, budget, business value streams, and status of SecDevOps (shifting left) adoption, Oberlaender explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But how does a cybersecurity expert learn what’s important to the business? They get out of their comfort zones. Or, as Oberlaender puts it, they go from department to department to learn about business priorities, then roll that knowledge up to higher groups and functions, ultimately reaching the board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cybersecurity-as-a-business-function"&gt;Cybersecurity as a business function&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The challenge has been that security is put in the wrong organizational structure — with the CISO reporting to the CIO or CTO or chief digital officer,” Oberlaender says. “Security is not foremost a technology problem. Maybe ten or twenty percent is technology. But the rest is people, process and the business. So, it takes CISOs years to change the culture.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rings particularly true when it comes to cybersecurity metrics, which in most cases rely too heavily on technical statistics and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) that befuddle business leaders and do little to prove the value of the cybersecurity function, says Chris Hetner, senior cyber risk advisor for the National Association of Corporate Directors (&lt;a href="http://nacdonline.org/"&gt;NACD&lt;/a&gt;) that serves a 24,000-member board room community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The board is fatigued. Board members are increasingly questioning if that capital is distributed effectively. But the CISO responds with this highly technical set of metrics they neither care for nor understand,” Hetner explains. “There is fatigue in the audit committee, in the board room, and among chief executives who, even after all these years working with security executives, still have limited visibility into where cyber security budgets are being deployed, let alone understanding how these investments reduce business risk and operational exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Hetner, all but the most regulated, risk-adverse industries (such as finance), usually lack an ERM function, which he defines as a critical conduit for the CISO to align security metrics with business, operations, financial, and regulatory requirements and eventually board engagement. Without that layer, CISOs operate in their own islands, which negatively impacts their ability to present the right metrics to their business leaders. To get started, he points out how frameworks like the &lt;a href="https://www.coso.org/erm-framework"&gt;COSO ERM&lt;/a&gt; framework ties into cyber security frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Boards are faced with complex matters such as impact on interest rates, tariffs, stock price volatility, supply chain issues, profitability, and acquisitions. Then the CISO enters the boardroom with their MITRE Attack framework, patching metrics and NIST maturity models,” Hetner continues. “These metrics are not aligned to what the board is conditioned to reviewing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hetner, who spoke with CSO just after interacting with hundreds of board members at the annual NACD Summit, says that those members want concise reports on prominent threats impacting their industry group. So, when Hetner brings in benchmarking and insights to boards and CEOs, he reveals how these threats would impact their business, operations, uptime, and financials versus the cost to prevent and protect against these industry-wide threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Boards love benchmarking against peers. They’re conditioned to look at benchmarking data. That’s what they do on compensation and competitive advantage and proxy disclosures. Why shouldn’t they be doing this for cyber?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="compare-metrics-against-their-risk-appetite"&gt;Compare metrics against their risk appetite&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nick Nolen, VP operations and cybersecurity strategy at consulting firm Redpoint Cybersecurity Services, comes from an operations background. From this perspective, he sees the board getting more involved in risk posture. He feels that this is a good sign for business-level cyber maturity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than just asking “are we secure?” business leaders are asking what metrics their cyber components are using to measure and quantify risk and how they’re spending against those risks. For CISO’s, this goes beyond measuring against frameworks such as NIST, listing a litany of security vulnerabilities they patched, or their mean time to response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead, we can say, ‘This is our potential financial exposure’,” Nolen explains. “So now you’re talking dollars and cents rather than CVEs and technical scores that board members don’t care about. What they care about is the bottom line.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nolen and his team use a proprietary, data-driven model to help calculate costs and financial exposures associated with cybersecurity programs. So, after conducting their assessments, they focus on critical gaps that most severely impact the business. Then they calculate that risk against 115 internal and external data sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Business leaders don’t care about the controls like MFA and the thirty other controls we’re spending on. They care about improving the company’s financial stability by securing critical business systems,” Nolen adds. “So, instead of a block of risks, we can show a risk curve before and after we strengthened controls. In one case, we showed a 40% reduction in total cyber loss exposure over six months, and the CEO asked, ‘We lowered risk by almost half?’ That’s a powerful metric.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the right calculations between business, risk, and potential losses, he shows the financial value of critical business risk exposure. So, if an organization is carrying $50 million in risk, its cyber insurer will only cover $25 million in a breach. Of that, what is the organization’s risk appetite?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the client needs to take that $25 million uninsured risk down to $10 million, they identify and calculate the cost of measures to reduce that risk. In other cases, they look at ROI based on risk reduction and how money is spread out across those programs. For example, one program may be returning 120% on investment, but another may return 800%, so that gets bumped to the top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The market is finally shifting from fear-based, reactionary selling — from CISOs talking technical terms the CEOs and CFOs don’t understand,” Nolen adds. “Now, CEOs and boards want to clearly understand business risks and potential exposure in metrics they are used to — probability, impact, and loss ranges — while also using business intelligence to drive value.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-choose-key-metrics"&gt;How to choose key metrics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The desire among CISO’s to prove the value of their programs prompted identity provider Okta to develop a report with input from several of its CISO Forum members. The report, a&lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-how-to-prove-the-roi-of-cybersecurity/"&gt; practical guide&lt;/a&gt; for proving the ROI of cybersecurity programs through business metrics, offers good, digestible advice from leading CISO’s on how to choose key metrics and KPIs (key performance indicators), including how to build strong relationships with stakeholders, how to tailor messaging to the audience, and how to tell a powerful story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, says Matt Immler, regional CSO for the Americas at Okta, “The board wants to know, ‘At what point can we stop spending and know we’re secure?’” That answer may be “never,” but CISO’s need to realize that’s a true pain point for business leaders. “That’s why we developed the report, because it’s so hard to quantify to a board or any sort of leadership or budget office what type of security metrics they can utilize to prove the value of the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Why you should purple team your SOC</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4083612/the-soc-parachute-needs-more-than-packing-it-needs-practice.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my previous article — &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4056178/your-soc-is-the-parachute-will-it-open.html"&gt;Your SOC is the parachute&lt;/a&gt; — I wrote about how many security operations centers (SOCs) would fail the moment we pull the ripcord. They’re overloaded, reactive, and often disconnected from how breaches actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I want to move the discussion forward. If the SOC is the parachute, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/652476/4-steps-for-purple-team-success.html"&gt;purple teaming&lt;/a&gt; should be the regular practice that keeps it ready to deploy. Yet most organizations still treat purple teaming as a one-off exercise rather than an ongoing discipline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="purple-teaming-needs-a-rethink"&gt;Purple teaming needs a rethink&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Purple teams were designed to bridge the gap between &lt;a href="https://chaleit.com/cyber-security/adversary-simulation/"&gt;red and blue teams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, it’s about collaboration and continual improvement. In practice, it’s often a transactional service run by penetration testing firms focused on two things: proving they can bypass defences and producing a report that looks good in a board pack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That mindset doesn’t help with SOC effectiveness. A single purple team engagement doesn’t build real capability, it just creates a false sense of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real uplift comes from repetition, rehearsal, and refinement. &lt;/strong&gt;In aviation, passing a check once is far from being enough. Proficiency is earned and maintained through regular practice. The same principle applies here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SOC operates constantly with new threats, tools, and mistakes, so testing must keep pace. That requires a mature, collaborative approach where defenders and testers work together, like scientists experimenting until the model holds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-adversarial-to-collaborative"&gt;From adversarial to collaborative&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though purple teaming is meant to be collaborative, it’s often run like a contest between red and blue teams — who can outsmart whom. That approach misses the point. The real measure of success isn’t how quickly someone breaks in but how well the organization learns to detect, adapt, and improve after the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong uplift program builds partnership, not rivalry.&lt;/strong&gt; It spreads knowledge across teams, asks “why did this work?” rather than “how did we get in?” and repeats until the right decisions become instinctive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reports don’t achieve that. Rehearsal does.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="simplicity-is-the-hardest-fix"&gt;Simplicity is the hardest fix&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my previous article, I argued that simplicity is one of the hardest things to achieve — yet when done well, it’s also the strongest defence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Too many SOCs chase metrics that don’t matter. I’ve seen teams with 15 key indicators forced to expand to 50 because leadership wanted to match an arbitrary industry benchmark taken from a compliance audit or a peer organization, a number that looked good in a report but had no connection to actual risk. That kind of thinking only creates noise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real maturity is subtractive. &lt;/strong&gt;It means knowing which signals matter and tuning for them. It means removing distractions so analysts can focus on behavior — the odd PowerShell command, the unfamiliar run DLL, the subtle anomaly that signals intent. That’s where early warning lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many security leaders worry that narrowing focus will make them vulnerable. The opposite is true: trying to monitor everything is what creates the blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="learning-from-phishing"&gt;Learning from phishing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a similar pattern in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/514515/what-is-phishing-examples-types-and-techniques.html"&gt;phishing&lt;/a&gt; awareness. Many organizations quietly lower the sophistication of their simulations so compliance scores look better. But that’s not real progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t out-train human fallibility. The better approach is to teach the&lt;em&gt; why&lt;/em&gt;, not just the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;. When people understand why something feels wrong — when the context ties back to personal safety — retention increases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same principle applies to the SOC. Train analysts not only to detect, but to understand. Let them study the anatomy of attacks, the leading indicators, and the behavior chains that matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SOC should be primarily a learning system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-soc-model-from-toolset-to-project"&gt;The SOC model, from toolset to project&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an article I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4035333/7-reasons-the-soc-is-in-crisis-and-5-steps-to-fix-it.html"&gt;the reasons the SOC is in crisis and steps to fix it&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned the need to integrate testing with operations, build context-aware detection, and establish clear response authorization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the most effective SOCs I’ve seen recently treat their function like a project instead of a toolset or outsourced service. They even have project managers embedded to drive iteration and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’ve also broken the old pyramid hierarchy. Instead of a single “head of SOC” holding all authority, they’ve delegated decision-making to teams who know the environment best. It’s faster, fairer, and a better training ground for emerging analysts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, they’ve shifted from a defensive posture to an inquisitive one. They constantly model how an attack could happen, how it might move laterally, and what artefacts it would leave behind. Then they test those assumptions again and again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="continuous-uplift-not-another-exercise"&gt;Continuous uplift, not another exercise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can’t treat purple teaming or SOC uplift as a box to tick. Breaches are now a fact of life. What matters is whether systems and people are ready to respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Endless testing is not the answer. Continuous learning is. Running small, focused simulations, observing, adjusting, and practicing until simplicity, speed, and intuition become second nature. Our client engagements demonstrate again and again that &lt;a href="https://chaleit.com/customer-stories/how-a-global-energy-firm-enhanced-soc-effectiveness-through-purple-teaming/"&gt;purple team exercises enhance SOC effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to stop measuring success by how complex our defences look and start measuring by how elegantly they work under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s how we go beyond purple teaming. That’s how we turn the SOC from a static service into a living capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
