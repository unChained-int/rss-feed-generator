      <title>Holes in Veeam Backup suite allow remote code execution, creation of malicious backup config files</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114165/holes-in-veeam-backup-suite-allow-remote-code-execution-creation-of-malicious-backup-config-files-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veeam &lt;a href="https://www.veeam.com/kb4792" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says that four vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; could allow a person with certain oversight roles for its flagship Backup &amp;amp; Replication suite to do serious damage to – but not destroy –  a backup database.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has already issued a patch for the bugs, which, it says, should be applied immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worst of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-59470, carries a criticality score of 9 and would allow a threat actor “to do something nefarious,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickvanover/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rick Vanover&lt;/a&gt;, Veeam’s vice-president of product strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But he emphasized that, because of the immutable nature of the backup, data can’t be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue: Veeam discovered that a person with the role of Backup Admin, Backup Operator, or Tape Operator status in unpatched version 13 of the suite (versions 13.0.1.180 and earlier) have more permissions than they should. The patch corrects that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the flaws addressed are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CVE-2025-59470 (with a CVSS score of 9) allows a Backup or Tape Operator to perform remote code execution (RCE) as the Postgres user by sending a malicious interval or order parameter;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CVE-2025-59469 (with a severity score of 7.2) allows a Backup or Tape Operator to write files as root;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CVE-2025-55125 (with a severity score of 7.2) allows a Backup or Tape Operator to perform remote code execution (RCE) as root by creating a malicious backup configuration file;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CVE-2025-59468 (with a severity score of 6.7) allows a Backup Administrator to perform remote code execution (RCE) as the Postgres user by sending a malicious password parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patch to version 13.0.1.1071 will be an “easy installation” that won’t be disruptive, Vanover said. As of Tuesday afternoon, Veeam hadn’t received reports of exploitation, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The good news is, if a Veeam server is broken, we can create a new server right away – presumably with this patch installed – import the backups and carry on. The core data is completely unimpacted by this,” Vanover said. “The worst type of thing would be the [backup] environment isn’t working right or the Postgres database is messed up on the Veeam server, so jobs might not behave in a way one might expect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In these cases, admins using the Veeam One monitoring management suite would get an alert if, for example, a job was unable to connect to the backup server or backup jobs were failing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The four vulnerabilities being patched are less severe than some because an attacker, internal or external, would need valid credentials for the three specific roles, noted &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, he added, backup systems like Veeam are targets for attackers, in particular those who inject ransomware, who often attempt to erase backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Backup systems should be regularly audited to ensure that access rights, such as those mentioned in this vulnerability, are properly managed and only accessible to users who actually need them,” he said. “Authentication credentials should be reviewed to ensure they comply with the respective standards.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellman/?originalSubdomain=ca" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kellman Meghu&lt;/a&gt;, principal security architect at Canadian-based risk management firm DeepCove Cybersecurity, said the worry is how the vulnerabilities could be used by a threat actor to get root privileges to the backup, “which is the worst it can get as far as compromise. From the sounds of the exploit, just being able to update a config file could be the avenue for executing malicious commands at the highest privileges.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Admins who can’t patch quickly, or who have been running unpatched versions for any length of time, should first audit all config files and operations to ensure there have been no changes to the config files or execution of additional unexpected actions. Alerts should be set for every backup process run, so it is closely monitored until the suite can be patched.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keep in mind,” he added, “if you do see unusual behavior, it is a sign that there is a malicious actor or inside threat operating, and you would need to take a holistic incident response.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Die wichtigsten CISO-Trends für 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109550/die-wichtigsten-ciso-trends-fur-2026.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Security-Trends 2026" class="wp-image-4109552" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2673772875.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lesen Sie, vor welchen Herausforderungen CISOs mit Blick auf das Jahr 2026 stehen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;SuPatMaN – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Jahr 2025 war für viele CISOs herausfordernd. Anfang des Jahres wurden mit dem Digital Operational Resilience Act (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3804883/dora-umsetzung-halt-banken-cisos-auf-trab.html"&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt;) alle Finanzunternehmen dazu verpflichtet, ihre Cybersicherheit zu erhöhen. Zudem mussten sich in diesem Jahr zahlreiche Unternehmen mit der &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090107/bundestag-beschliest-nis2-umsetzung.html"&gt;NIS2-Umsetzung&lt;/a&gt; auseinandersetzen. Vor welchen Schwierigkeiten stehen CISOs im Jahr 2026?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="herausforderungen-2026"&gt;Herausforderungen 2026&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nach Meinung von Raphael Reiß, CISO der Vaillant Group, wird das Thema Compliance auch noch im neuen Jahr herausfordernd sein. Er bezeichnet das Ganze als „Regulatorik-Dschungel“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch Vorwerk-CISO Florian Jörgens sieht die „zunehmend komplexen regulatorischen Anforderungen“ weiterhin als Herausforderung. Diese würden kontinuierliche Nachweise statt punktuelle Compliance verlangen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hinzu kämen wachsender Kostendruck trotz steigender Bedrohungslage und ein verschärfter Fachkräftemangel in allen sicherheitsrelevanten Rollen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holger Bajohr, CISO der Technische Werke Ludwigshafen, stimmt dem zu: „Ich glaube, dass das Thema Fachkräftemangel noch deutlich spürbarer werden wird und dass Experten schwieriger zu bekommen sein werden.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sicherheitstrends"&gt;Sicherheitstrends&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stefan Braun, CISO von Henkel, ist sich sicher: „2026 wird weniger durch neue Bedrohungen geprägt sein als durch steigende Komplexität. CISOs müssen gleichzeitig regulatorische Anforderungen, operative Resilienz in IT und OT sowie den sicheren Einsatz von KI beherrschen – oft mit begrenzten Ressourcen.“ Die größte Herausforderung ist seiner Ansicht nach, Sicherheit nicht als Verhinderer, sondern als Enabler von Geschwindigkeit und Innovation zu positionieren und messbar zum Geschäftserfolg beizutragen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jörgens sieht ebenfalls einen klaren Trend in der Kontrolle des Einsatzes von KI, „insbesondere der Umgang mit Shadow AI, also inoffiziellen KI-Tools in den Fachbereichen.“ Der Vorwerk-CISO prognostiziert zudem, dass Third-Party-Risk-Management stärker in den Fokus rückt, weil Lieferketten und externe Modelle zu den größten Angriffsflächen werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vor diesem Hintergrund zählt laut Vaillant-CISO Reiß Resilience by Design zu den wichtigsten Themen im kommenden Jahr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Henkel-CISO Braun fügt hinzu: „Software-Supply-Chain-Security und transparente Risikosteuerung gewinnen an Bedeutung. Der Fokus verschiebt sich klar von reiner Prävention hin zu Resilienz und Recovery.“ Der Sicherheitsexperte geht zudem davon aus, dass &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105647/zero-trust-umsetzung-die-richtige-kommunikation-zahlt.html"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt; stärker operationalisiert wird, insbesondere über Identitäten, privilegierte Zugriffe und Maschinen-Accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Gleichzeitig werden wir mehr KI auf beiden Seiten sehen: Angreifer nutzen sie zur Skalierung, Verteidiger zur besseren Priorisierung, Korrelation und Automatisierung“, schließt Braun ab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Top cyber threats to your AI systems and infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110008/top-cyber-threats-to-your-ai-systems-and-infrastructure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attacks against AI systems and infrastructure are beginning to take shape in real-world instances, and security experts expect the number of these attack types will rise in coming years. In a rush to realize the benefits of AI, most organizations have played it &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3529615/companies-skip-security-hardening-in-rush-to-adopt-ai.html"&gt;fast and loose on security hardening&lt;/a&gt; when rolling out AI tools and use cases. As a result, experts also warn that many organizations aren’t prepared to detect, deflect, or respond to such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most are aware of the possibility of such attacks, but I don’t think a lot of people are fully aware of how to properly mitigate the risk,” says &lt;a href="https://www.usf.edu/ai-cybersecurity-computing/people/faculty/licato-john.aspx"&gt;John Licato&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor in the Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and Computing at the University of South Florida, founder and director of the Advancing Machine and Human Reasoning Lab, and owner of startup company Actualization.AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-threats-to-ai-systems"&gt;Top threats to AI systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple attack types against AI systems are arising. Some attacks, such as data poisoning, occur during training. Others, such as adversarial inputs, happen during inference. Still others, such as model theft, occur during deployment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is a rundown of the top threat types to AI infrastructure experts warn about today. Some are more rare or theoretical than others, though many have been observed in the wild or have been demonstrated by researchers through notable proofs of concept.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-poisoning"&gt;Data poisoning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570555/how-data-poisoning-attacks-corrupt-machine-learning-models.html"&gt;Data poisoning&lt;/a&gt; is a type of attack in which bad actorsmanipulate, tamper with, and pollute the data used to develop or train AI systems, including machine learning models. By corrupting the data or introducing faulty data, attackers can alter, bias, or otherwise render inaccurate a model’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine an attack that tells a model that green means stop instead of go, says &lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/V6WVSWFS/Rob%20T.%20Lee"&gt;Robert T. Lee&lt;/a&gt;, CAIO and chief of research at SANS, a security training and certification firm. “It’s meant to degrade the output of the model,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="model-poisoning"&gt;Model poisoning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, the attack goes after the model itself, seeking to produce inaccurate results by tampering with the model’s architecture or parameters. Some definitions of model poisoning models also include attacks where the model’s training data has been corrupted through data poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tool-poisoning"&gt;Tool poisoning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Invariant Labs identified this type of attack in spring 2025. When &lt;a href="https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks"&gt;announcing its findings&lt;/a&gt;, Invariant wrote that it had “discovered a critical vulnerability in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows for what we term &lt;em&gt;Tool Poisoning Attacks&lt;/em&gt;. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive data exfiltration and unauthorized actions by AI models.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company went on to note that its experiments showed “that a malicious server can not only exfiltrate sensitive data from the user but also hijack the agent’s behavior and override instructions provided by other, trusted servers, leading to a complete compromise of the agent’s functionality, even with respect to trusted infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These attacks involve embedding malicious instructions inside MCP tool descriptions that, when interpreted by AI models, can hijack the model. These attacks essentially corrupt the MCP layer “to trick an agent to do something,” says &lt;a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/chirag-mehta"&gt;Chirag Mehta&lt;/a&gt;, vice principal and principal analyst at Constellation Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more on MCP threats, see “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4023795/top-10-mcp-vulnerabilities.html"&gt;Top 10 MCP vulnerabilities: The hidden risks of AI integrations&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="prompt-injection"&gt;Prompt injection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a prompt injection attack, hackers use prompts that look legitimate but actually have embedded malicious commands meant to get the large language model to do something it shouldn’t. Hackers use these prompts to trick the model to bypass or override its guardrails, to share sensitive data, or to perform unauthorized actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With prompt injection, you can change what the AI agent is supposed to do,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-cros-3b66a332/"&gt;Fabien Cros&lt;/a&gt;, chief data and AI officer at global consulting firm Ducker Carlisle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several notable prompt injection attacks and proofs of concept have been reported of late, including &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086965/researchers-trick-chatgpt-into-prompt-injecting-itself.html"&gt;researchers tricking ChatGPT into prompt injecting itself&lt;/a&gt;, attackers &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053107/ai-prompt-injection-gets-real-with-macros-the-latest-hidden-threat.html"&gt;embedding malicious prompts into document macros&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4036868/black-hat-researchers-demonstrate-zero-click-prompt-injection-attacks-in-popular-ai-agents.html"&gt;demoing zero-click prompt attacks on popular AI agents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="adversarial-inputs"&gt;Adversarial inputs&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model owners and operators use perturbed data to test models for resiliency, but hackers use it to disrupt. In an adversarial input attack, malicious actors feed deceptive data to a model with the goal of making the model output incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The changes to the perturbed input are typically small, or the deceptive data may be noise; the changes are deliberately designed to be subtle enough to evade detection by security systems but still capable of throwing off the model. This makes adversarial inputs a type of evasion attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="model-theft-model-extraction"&gt;Model theft/model extraction&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malicious actors can replicate, or reverse-engineer, a model, its parameters, and even its training data. They typically do this using publicly available APIs — for example, the model’s prediction API or a cloud services API — to repeatedly query the model and collect outputs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They then can analyze how the model responds and use that analysis to reconstruct it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s enabling unauthorized duplication of the tools itself,” says &lt;a href="Allison%20W.%20%7C%20LinkedIn"&gt;Allison Wikoff&lt;/a&gt;, director and Americas lead for global threat intelligence at PwC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="model-inversion"&gt;Model inversion&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model inversion refers to a specific extraction attack in which the adversary attempts to reconstruct or infer the data that was used to train the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The name comes from the hackers “inverting” the model, using its outputs to reconstruct or reverse-engineer information about the inputs used to train the model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chain-risks"&gt;Supply chain risks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like other software systems, AI systems are built with a combination of components that can include open-source code, open-source models, third-party models, and various sources of data. Any security vulnerability in the components can show up in the AI systems. This makes AI systems vulnerable to supply chain attacks, where hackers can exploit vulnerabilities within the components to launch an attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For recent examples, see “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015077/ai-supply-chain-threats-are-looming-as-security-practices-lag.html"&gt;AI supply chain threats loom — as security practices lag&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jailbreaking"&gt;Jailbreaking&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also called model jailbreaking, attackers’ goal here is to get AI systems — primarily through engaging with LLMs — to disregard the guardrails that confine their actions and behavior, such as safeguards to prevent harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hackers can use various techniques to execute this type of attack. For example, they could employ a role-playing exploit (aka role-play attack), using commands to instruct the AI to adopt a persona (such as a developer) that can work around the guardrails. They could disguise malicious instructions in seemingly legitimate prompts or use encoding, foreign words, or keyboard characters to bypass filters. They could also use a prompt framed as a hypothetical or research question or a series of prompts that leads to their end objective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those objectives, which also are varied, include getting AI systems to write malicious code, spread problematic content, and reveal sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When there is a chat interface, there are ways to interact with it to get it to operate outside the parameters,” Licato says. “That’s the tradeoff of having an increasingly powerful reasoning system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="counteracting-threats-to-ai-systems"&gt;Counteracting threats to AI systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While their executive colleagues jump into AI initiatives in search of enhanced productivity and innovation, CISOs must take an active role in ensuring security for those initiatives — and the organization’s AI infrastructure at large — is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.hackerone.com/report/ciso"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; from security tech company HackerOne, 84% of CISOs are now responsible for AI security and 82% now oversee data privacy. If CISOs don’t &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4011384/the-cisos-5-step-guide-to-securing-ai-operations.html"&gt;advance their security strategies to counteract attacks against AI systems&lt;/a&gt; and the data the feeds them, future issues will reflect on their leadership — regardless of whether they were invited to the table when AI initiatives were conceived and launched.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, CISOs have a “need for a proactive AI security strategy,” according to Constellation’s Mehta.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI security is not just a technical challenge but also a strategic imperative requiring executive buy in and cross-functional collaboration,” he writes in his 2025 report &lt;a href="https://www.constellationr.com/research/ai-security-beyond-traditional-cyberdefenses"&gt;AI Security Beyond Traditional Cyberdefenses: Rethinking Cybersecurity for the Age of AI and Autonomy&lt;/a&gt;. “Data governance is foundational, because securing AI begins with ensuring the integrity and provenance of training data and model inputs. Security teams must develop new expertise to handle AI-driven risks, and business leaders must recognize the implications of autonomous AI systems and the governance frameworks needed to manage them responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strategies for assessing, managing, and counteracting the threat of attacks on AI systems are emerging. In addition to maintaining strong data governance and other fundamental cyber defense best practices, AI and security experts say CISOs and their organizations should be evaluating AI models before deploying them, monitoring AI systems in use, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101929/offensive-security-takes-center-stage-in-the-ai-era.html"&gt;using red teams to test models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs may need to implement specific actions to counter certain attacks, says PwC’s Wikoff. For example, CISOs looking to head off model theft can monitor for suspicious queries and patterns as well as have timeouts and capture rate-limited responses. Or, to help prevent evasion attacks, security leaders could employ adversarial training — essentially training models to guard against those types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopting &lt;a href="https://atlas.mitre.org/"&gt;MITRE ATLAS&lt;/a&gt; is another step. This framework, short for Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems, provides a knowledge base mapping how attackers target AI systems and details identifying tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security and AI experts acknowledge the challenges of taking such steps. Many CISOs are contending with more immediate threats, including &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4044007/shadow-ai-is-surging-getting-ai-adoption-right-is-your-best-defense.html"&gt;shadow AI&lt;/a&gt; and attacks that are getting faster, more sophisticated, and harder to detect, thanks in part to attackers’ use of AI. And given that attacks on AI systems are still nascent, with some attack types still considered theoretical, CISOs face challenges in getting resources to develop strategies and skills to counteract attacks on AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For the CISO this is something that’s really difficult, because attacks on AI backends is still being researched. We’re at the early stages of figuring out what hackers are doing and why,” Lee, of SANS, says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lee and others recognize the competitive pressure on organizations to make the most of AI, yet they stress that CISOs and their executive colleagues can’t let securing AI systems be an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Thinking about what these attacks could be as they build the infrastructure is key for the CISO,” says &lt;a href="(35)%20Matt%20G.%20%7C%20LinkedIn"&gt;Matt Gorham&lt;/a&gt;, leader of PwC’s Cyber and Risk Innovation Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Seit Anfang Dezember gilt die EU-Sicherheitsrichtline &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090107/bundestag-beschliest-nis2-umsetzung.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS2&lt;/a&gt; auch in Deutschland. Rund 29.500 Unternehmen sind dadurch verpflichtet, sich als NIS-2-Einrichtungen zu registrieren und dem Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) erhebliche Sicherheitsvorfälle zu melden. Vor diesem Hintergrund hat das BSI ein neues Portal entwickelt, das gebündelte Informationen und Hilfestellungen bietet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bsi-portal-soll-austausch-erleichtern"&gt;BSI-Portal soll Austausch erleichtern&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das &lt;a href="https://portal.bsi.bund.de/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BSI-Portal &lt;/a&gt;basiert auf einer Cloud-Infrastruktur von Amazon Web Services (AWS) und soll sukzessiv zu einer Informations- und Austauschplattform mit Echtzeit-Daten und aktuellen Analysen für schnelle Reaktionsmöglichkeiten ausgebaut werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„NIS2 sorgt dafür, dass wichtige und besonders wichtige Einrichtungen sowie die gesamte Bundesverwaltung ihre Cyberresilienz effektiv und effizient stärken. Um diesen und weitere Prozesse komfortabel und unbürokratisch zu gestalten, haben wir das BSI-Portal als One-Stop-Shop konzipiert“, erklärt BSI-Präsidentin Claudia Plattner. „Es soll den sicheren und zielgerichteten Austausch relevanter Cybersicherheitsinformationen zwischen Unternehmen, Behörden und Institutionen erleichtern.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Portal unterstützt Unternehmen unter anderem dabei, eine Risikoanalyse durchzuführen und Maßnahmen zum Risikomanagement umzusetzen. Zudem erhalten bereits registrierte Unternehmen und Institutionen ab sofort Informationen zu ihren gesetzlichen Pflichten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zudem können sich Organisationen über die Plattform der &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/Webs/ACS/DE/Home/home_node.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Allianz für Cyber-Sicherheit&lt;/a&gt; (ACS) anschließen. Das IT-Sicherheits-Netzwerk unter dem Dach des BSI bietet seinen derzeit knapp 9.000 Mitgliedern vielfältige Formate zum Wissens- und Erfahrungsaustausch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus stellt das BSI seine Tageslageberichte und IT-Sicherheitsmitteilungen über die Plattform bereit. Auch Schwachstellen und Sicherheitslücken können über das BSI-Portal gemeldet werden – dies ist auch anonym und ohne Registrierung möglich, verspricht die Behörde.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kritik-aus-der-security-szene"&gt;Kritik aus der Security-Szene&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Tatsache, dass das BSI-Portal auf AWS gehostet wird, sorgt allerdings bei einigen Security-Experten für Unmut. Auf LinkedIn bezeichnet &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7414960252967657472/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Benjamin Richter&lt;/a&gt;, CEO bei Cyber Complete, das Ganze vor dem Hintergrund der digitalen Souveränität als strategisches ein Eigentor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der IT-Sicherheitsexperte &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7414629985698611200/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jürgen Mayershofer&lt;/a&gt; stimmt dem zu: „Das ist ein ganz falsches Signal des BSI an den deutschen Markt, während quer durch Europa über digitale Souveränität und Resilienz diskutiert wird.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7414244650385039362/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Karsten Bartels&lt;/a&gt;, Rechtsanwalt für IT-Sicherheitsrecht, kann die Entscheidung des BSI für AWS nur schwer nachvollziehen. „Gerade diese Plattform dieser Behörde“, moniert der Experte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Ganz einfach, BSI steht für ‚Bundesamt für SICHERHEIT in der Informationstechnik‘, nicht “Bundesamt für Souveränität in der Informationstechnik‘“, spöttelt der auf Cloud und Datensouveränität spezialisierte Gartner-Analyst &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/renebuest_plattner-zum-bsi-portal-werden-nicht-die-activity-7414654080192798720-pWLC/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAAF1j5YBGyg76yL9ZDczpUIfAcxmrR76duk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;René Büst&lt;/a&gt;. „Und Sicherheit und Souveränität haben miteinander nichts zu tun. Man kann eine sehr sichere Cloud nutzen aber gleichzeitig zu 0% souverän sein. Das hat das BSI leider nicht verstanden.“&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Phishing-Angreifer setzen vermehrt auf E-Mail-Routing-Lücken</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114453/phishing-angreifer-setzen-vermehrt-auf-e-mail-routing-lucken.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Phishing" class="wp-image-4114456" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2456545813.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Angreifer missbrauchen falsch konfigurierte Richtlinien, um Phishing-E-Mails wie interne E-Mails aussehen zu lassen, Filter zu umgehen und Anmeldedaten zu stehlen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;batjaket – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Threat Intelligence Team von Microsoft hat kürzlich festgestellt, dass Angreifer zunehmend komplexe E-Mail-Weiterleitungen und falsch konfigurierte Domain-Spoofing-Schutzmaßnahmen ausnutzen. Dabei lassen sie ihre Phishing-Nachrichten so aussehen, als würden sie von den angegriffenen Organisationen selbst stammen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In den Angriffskampagnen werden Konfigurationslücken missbraucht. Das gilt insbesondere für solche bei MX-DNS-Einträgen (Mail Exchanger), die nicht direkt auf Microsoft 365 verweisen und in denen die Richtlinien für Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp;amp; Conformance (DMARC) und Sender Policy Framework (SPF) zu lax oder falsch konfiguriert sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Angreifer haben diesen Vektor genutzt, um eine Vielzahl von Phishing-Nachrichten im Zusammenhang mit verschiedenen Phishing-as-a-Service-Plattformen (PhaaS) wie Tycoon 2FA zu versenden“, erklärt &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/06/phishing-actors-exploit-complex-routing-and-misconfigurations-to-spoof-domains/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft in einem Blogbeitrag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Technikriese weist darauf hin, dass dieser Angriffsvektor zwar nicht neu ist, seine Nutzung jedoch seit Mitte 2025 deutlich zugenommen hat. Dabei reichen die Phishing-Köder von Passwort-Zurücksetzungen bis hin zu freigegebenen Dokumenten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="internes-routing-und-schwache-richtlinien"&gt;„Internes“ Routing und schwache Richtlinien&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Fehler liegt darin, wie empfangende Mailserver eingehende Nachrichten interpretieren. Wenn MX-Einträge zu komplexen Mail-pPfaden führen, zum Beispiel zu lokalen Systemen oder Microsoft 365 vorgeschalteten Relay-Servern von Drittanbietern , werden standardmäßige Spoofing-Schutzprüfungen wie SPF Hard-Fail und strenge DMARC-Durchsetzung möglicherweise nicht korrekt angewendet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesen Fällen kann eine Phishing-E-Mail mit der eigenen Adresse des Empfängers sowohl im „An”- als auch im „Von”-Feld ankommen, eine gefälschte Nachricht, die auf den ersten Blick wie eine interne E-Mail erscheint. In einigen Fällen ändern Angreifer zusätzlich den Absendernamen, um die Nachricht überzeugender erscheinen zu lassen, während das „Von”-Feld auf eine gültige interne E-Mail-Adresse gesetzt wird.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Kombination mit laxen oder fehlenden DMARC- und SPF-Richtlinien können diese Nachrichten Spam-Filter umgehen und direkt im Posteingang der Benutzer landen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Phishing-Nachrichten, die über diesen Vektor versendet werden, können effektiver sein, da sie wie intern versendete Nachrichten erscheinen“, betont Microsoft in seinem Beitrag. „Eine erfolgreiche Kompromittierung von Anmeldedaten durch Phishing-Angriffe kann zu Datendiebstahl oder Business Email Compromise &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494543/mehrstufige-angriffe-business-email-compromise-erreicht-neue-dimension.html" target="_blank"&gt;(BEC)-Angriffen &lt;/a&gt;auf das betroffene Unternehmen oder dessen Partner führen und umfangreiche Abhilfemaßnahmen erforderlich machen und/oder im Falle von Finanzbetrug zu finanziellen Verlusten führen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Über die Erfassung von Anmeldedaten hinaus kann die PhaaS-Infrastruktur AiTM-Angriffe (Adversary-in-the-Middle) ermöglichen, bei denen Authentifizierungsinformationen in Echtzeit weitergeleitet werden und sogar Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierungsmaßnahmen umgangen werden können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="konfigurationen-zur-absicherung-konnen-helfen"&gt;Konfigurationen zur Absicherung können helfen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft betont, dass eine korrekte Konfiguration von E-Mail-Authentifizierungsmechanismen die wirksamste Verteidigung gegen diesen Spoofing-Vektor sei. Unternehmen wird empfohlen, strenge DMARC-Reject-Richtlinien einzuführen und SPF-Hard-Fails durchzusetzen, damit nicht authentifizierte E-Mails, die angeblich von ihren Domänen stammen, abgelehnt oder sicher unter Quarantäne gestellt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus wird empfohlen, alle Konnektoren von Drittanbietern, wie Spamfilter, Archivierungsdienste oder ältere Mail-Relays, korrekt einzurichten. Damit können Spoof-Prüfungen konsistent berechnet und durchgesetzt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mandanten mit MX-Einträgen, die direkt auf Microsoft 365 verweisen, sind von diesem Problem nicht betroffen. Die nativen Spoof-Erkennungs- und Filtermechanismen von Microsoft verhindern solche Angriffe und werden standardmäßig angewendet. Für komplexere E-Mail-Infrastrukturen hat Microsoft spezifische Richtlinien zu &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-in/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rules" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;E-Mail-Regeln und Authentifizierungsverfahren&lt;/a&gt; bereitgestellt, um das Risiko zu verringern und gefälschte E-Mails zu blockieren, bevor sie überhaupt den Posteingang der Endbenutzer erreichen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Über die Korrekturen zur E-Mail-Authentifizierung hinaus fordert Microsoft Unternehmen dazu auf, ihre Identitäts-Schutzmaßnahmen gegen AiTM-Phishing zu verstärken, einer Methode, bei der Passwörter durch die Übernahme authentifizierter Sitzungen umgangen werden. Zu den empfohlenen Kontrollmaßnahmen gehören Phishing-resistente MFA wie FIDO2-Sicherheitsschlüssel, die Durchsetzung bedingter Zugriffsrechte und Schutzmaßnahmen wie MFA-Nummernabgleich, um die Auswirkungen gestohlener Token zu begrenzen. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The 2 faces of AI: How emerging models empower and endanger cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4113987/the-2-faces-of-ai-how-emerging-models-empower-and-endanger-cybersecurity.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my long career of safeguarding digital assets, I’ve seen technology shifts come and go, but nothing compares to the disruptive force of AI and large language models (LLMs). AI is quite literally a double-edged sword when it comes to cybersecurity. The same capabilities that allow us to automate threat detection and write secure code faster are being weaponized by adversaries to create a new generation of cyberthreats. For any CISO or security leader, our primary focus must shift; we are no longer just fighting human adversaries, we are fighting AI-augmented, automated threat agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-offensive-edge"&gt;The offensive edge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are witnessing a drastic reduction in the cost and expertise required for cybercrime. What used to take a skilled human weeks can now be orchestrated by an AI agent in hours, driving what we call cyberthreat inflation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="self-modifying-evasive-malware"&gt;Self-modifying, evasive malware&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, the researchers at Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) identified a disturbing new trend: malware that uses LLMs during execution to dynamically alter its own behavior and evade detection. This is not pre-generated code, this is code that adapts mid-execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threat-actor-usage-of-ai-tools"&gt;GTIG identified an experimental malware called PROMPTFLUX&lt;/a&gt;, which connects to a commercial LLM API (such as the Gemini API) to request new code-obfuscation and evasion scripts on the fly. This technique, which allows for just-in-time code generation, represents a significant step toward autonomous and adaptive malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another case, GTIG identified PROMPTSTEAL, which was being used by the Russia-linked APT28 group against Ukraine. This malware queries an LLM (the Qwen2.5-Coder model on Hugging Face) to generate reconnaissance commands instead of having them hard-coded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some analysis projects that the percentage of all malware detections with an LLM contribution has &lt;a href="https://www.techrxiv.org/users/955300/articles/1324994/master/file/data/Updated_Dual-Use_Risks_LLM_Final_88_TechRxiv/Updated_Dual-Use_Risks_LLM_Final_88_TechRxiv.pdf?inline=true"&gt;soared from just 2% in 2021 to a projected 50% by 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first autonomous espionage campaign&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently &lt;a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf"&gt;disclosed a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation, attributed to a state-sponsored threat actor, that leveraged its own Claude Codemodel to target roughly 30 organizations globally&lt;/a&gt;, including major financial institutions and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat actor manipulated the model into functioning as an autonomous cyber attack agent, which executed 80% to 90% of tactical operations, from reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery to credential harvesting and data exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human operator only stepped in at critical choke points, such as authorizing the progression from reconnaissance to active exploitation. The AI autonomously mapped networks, discovered vulnerabilities and performed post-exploitation activities at machine speed, an unprecedented rate that traditional, human-speed defenses cannot match.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="deepfake-driven-financial-fraud"&gt;Deepfake-driven financial fraud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, generative AI has amplified social engineering through hyper-realistic deepfakes. Deepfake-based scams have skyrocketed, enabling voice and video forgeries that deceive even seasoned professionals. A dramatic example occurred when a Ferrari executive was nearly fooled by a voice-cloned deepfake of the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more recently, an employee at a global design firm was fooled by an AI-generated video call impersonating the company’s CFO and other executives, resulting in a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt;$25 million loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt; transferred&lt;/a&gt; to the fraudsters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-defensive-edge"&gt;The defensive edge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If adversaries are operating at AI speed, our defenses must too. The silver lining of this dual-use dynamic is that the most powerful LLMs are also being harnessed by defenders to create fundamentally new security capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="vulnerability-detection-from-zero-days-to-autonomous-pentesting"&gt;Vulnerability detection: From zero-days to autonomous pentesting&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LLMs’ semantic code understanding and contextual reasoning offer a significant advantage over traditional, signature-based static analyzers, especially in the discovery of unknown threats before malicious actors find and exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LLMs have shown extraordinary potential in identifying unknown, unpatched flaws (zero-days). These models significantly outperform conventional static analyzers, particularly in uncovering subtle logic flaws and buffer overflows in novel software. For instance, Google’s &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/10/from-naptime-to-big-sleep.html"&gt;Big Sleep project&lt;/a&gt; used an LLM to identify a zero-day vulnerability in the critical SQLite database used across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example is &lt;a href="https://xbow.com/"&gt;XBOW&lt;/a&gt;, which is an autonomous AI penetration testing agent that leverages LLMs to simulate real-world attacks the same way a human counterpart would do. XBOW achieved the #1 spot on the HackerOne US Leaderboard, demonstrating that AI can match and, in some benchmarks, surpass expert human hackers in finding a broad range of vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, XSS).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By deploying AI agents like XBOW against our own systems, we can systematically test every endpoint and attack vector. This scales ethical offensive security testing from a periodic audit into an on-demand, pre-production workflow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Google’s DeepMind has pioneered an AI-powered agent called CodeMender that automatically detects, patches and rewrites vulnerable code to eliminate whole classes of security flaws. This reactive and proactive approach represents a major step forward in defensive automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="threat-hunting-and-behavioral-analysis"&gt;Threat hunting and behavioral analysis&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LLMs are transforming threat hunting from a manual, keyword-based search to an intelligent, contextual query process that focuses on behavioral anomalies. By processing and correlating massive, unstructured datasets such as network logs, security incident reports and threat intelligence feeds (OSINT), LLMs gain the contextual understanding necessary to generate high-confidence hypotheses about potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/security/ai"&gt;Google Threat Intelligence with Gemini&lt;/a&gt; enhances this process by providing essential contextual grounding with data from multiple sources like VirusTotal and Mandiant to determine, in real-time, which global threat actor tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that are most relevant to a particular industry or organization and prioritize what’s most important from tens of thousands of reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Palantir’s AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) utilizes LLMs to analyze anomalous user or system behavior across vast data lakes, identifies subtle indicators of compromise that span different systems and suggests a prioritized attack path for the human analyst to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Governance, compliance and regulation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LLMs also offer a profound scalable solution to managing non-technical risk compliance, privacy and regulatory complexity, which represent significant financial and legal liability. LLMs can be leveraged to shift governance from periodic audits to continuous policy enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.itmagination.com/blog/eu-ai-act-compliance-in-practice-a-microsoft-centric-approach"&gt;Microsoft’s Compliance Manager&lt;/a&gt; can ingest and understand vast amounts of unstructured data, such as internal security policies, legal contracts and external regulatory texts like GDPR or the EU AI Act. It then automatically maps the requirements of one framework to another, dramatically reducing the manual effort needed to prove compliance during an audit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IBM’s Watsonx applies LLM capabilities for compliance and risk management. For a financial services firm, this might mean the model continuously scans new trading application code to verify that all data handling aligns with HIPAA or PCI DSS before deployment, automatically flagging any deviation from established policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bringing-it-all-together"&gt;Bringing it all together&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI systems continue to advance from generative models to autonomous agents, their dual-use nature can’t be ignored. The same tools that help defenders accelerate incident response can also empower attackers to craft deepfakes, launch social engineering campaigns and more. This tension isn’t a temporary byproduct of innovation, but it is a structural reality of AI’s rapid evolution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the challenge isn’t to halt AI progress but to guide it responsibly. That means building guardrails into models, improving transparency and developing governance frameworks that keep pace with emerging capabilities. It also requires organizations to rethink security strategies, recognizing that AI is both an opportunity and a risk multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, AI’s impact on cybersecurity will be shaped not just by what these systems can do, but by how we choose to use them. The future will belong to those who can harness AI’s defensive power while staying vigilant against its offensive potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest flaw in Cisco Systems Identity Services Engine (ISE), which could expose sensitive information to an attacker, requires rotation of credentials as well as installation of a patch to correct, says an expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco ISE is a network access control platform that enforces access policy and manages endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There have been more critical holes in Cisco products, acknowledged Paddy Harrington, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, and this one does need a threat actor with administrative privileges to execute and get read access to sensitive information. “However,” he advised senior infosec leaders with Cisco ISE servers, “don’t let these things hang around.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before patching, he said, admins should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rotate ISE credentials for those with existing and approved access;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;ensure only those who need access have credentials;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;reduce the number of devices that can access the ISE server;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;patch as soon as it’s possible to take the server offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxe-jWSbSDKt" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In its notice to customers&lt;/a&gt;, Cisco says a &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-20029" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; [CVE-2026-20029] in the licensing features of ISE and Cisco ISE Passive Identity Connector (ISE-PIC) could allow an authenticated remote attacker with administrative privileges to gain access to sensitive information. It isn’t clear why this is called a licensing feature vulnerability. Cisco didn’t respond by deadline when asked for an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advisory, which describes the problem as of medium criticality, with a CVSS score of 4.9, says the vulnerability is due to improper parsing of XML that is processed by the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE and Cisco ISE-PIC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Institute, said, “Most likely, this is an XML External Entity vulnerability.” External entities, he explained, are an XML feature that instructs the parser to either read local files or access external URLs. In this case, an attacker could embed an external entity in the license file, instructing the XML parser to read a confidential file and include it in the response. This is a common vulnerability in XML parsers, he said, typically mitigated by disabling external entity parsing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker would be able to obtain read access to confidential files like configuration files, he added, and possibly user credentials. Ullrich also said an ISE administrator may have access to a lot of the information, but they should not have access to user credentials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cisco advisory says an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to the application: “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system that could include sensitive data that should otherwise be inaccessible even to administrators. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco said proof-of-concept exploit code is available for this vulnerability, but so far the company isn’t aware of any malicious use of the hole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These days, admin credentials aren’t hard to get, Harrington noted. The “dirty secret that few people want to talk about is across IT and security operations there are so many systems that are left with default credentials.” That’s particularly common, he said, with devices behind a firewall, such as network access control servers, because admins think because they are inside the network they can’t be touched by external hackers. But lots of credentials can be scooped up in compromises of applications where Cisco admins might have stored passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, today researchers at SCORadar &lt;a href="https://socradar.io/resources/whitepapers/end-of-the-year-intelligence-2025/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released an analysis of data thefts in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, it notes that credential theft hit a new high last year. A total of 388 million credentials were stolen from the ten most affected platforms, including Facebook, Google, and Roblox.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lesen Sie, welche Cybersecurity-Zertifizierungen Ihrer Karriere als CISO einen Schub geben." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3376702/1200x.jpg" title="Lesen Sie, welche Cybersecurity-Zertifizierungen Ihrer Karriere als CISO einen Schub geben." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Lesen Sie, welche Cybersecurity-Zertifizierungen Ihrer Karriere als CISO einen Schub geben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: Elnur – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zertifizierungen in der Cybersicherheit können das vorhandene Fachwissen hervorheben, die Glaubwürdigkeit erhöhen und Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten eröffnen. Zudem sorgen Cybersecurity-Zertifikate dafür, dass leitende Cybersicherheitsfachkräfte über die sich entwickelnden Bedrohungen auf dem Laufenden bleiben. Darüber hinaus erleichtern sie die Vernetzung und stellen Fähigkeiten im Bereich Compliance und Risikomanagement unter Beweis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Zertifizierungen decken alle Cybersecurity-Bereiche und -Fähigkeiten ab – das heißt physische, technische, administrative und betriebliche – bis hin zu einer sehr starken Fokus auf einen bestimmten Hardwarehersteller oder eine bestimmte Art von Technologie, wie zum Beispiel Ransomware”, erklärt Rebecca Herold, IEEE-Mitglied und Gründerin der Beratungsfirma The Privacy Professor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doch bevor Sie mit dem Sammeln von Zertifizierungen beginnen, sollten Sie herausfinden, in welchem Bereich der Cybersicherheit Sie arbeiten möchten, rät die Expertin. “Es hat keinen Sinn, eine Zertifizierung anzustreben, die Tätigkeiten abdeckt und Kenntnisse über Fähigkeiten erfordert, die Sie während Ihrer Karriere nie anwenden wollen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Herold bieten Cybersecurity-Zertifizierungen folgende Vorteile:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validierung Ihrer Cybersecurity-Fähigkeiten, da sie sich auf die entsprechenden Zertifizierungen beziehen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aufbau Ihrer beruflichen Glaubwürdigkeit, indem Sie zeigen, dass Sie in diesem Bereich bleiben und nicht nur von einer Karriere zur nächsten springen. Arbeitgeber investieren gerne in Mitarbeiter, die langfristig bleiben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sie helfen Ihnen, Ihre Karriere schneller voranzutreiben, da viele Unternehmen Kandidaten bevorzugen, die sich die Zeit genommen haben, solche Zertifizierungen zu erwerben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sie verschaffen Ihnen Anerkennung für Ihre Fähigkeiten bei anderen in der Branche, was für eine lange und erfolgreiche Karriere wichtig ist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sie schaffen die Voraussetzungen für mehr Networking-Möglichkeiten, bei denen Sie noch mehr Wissen erwerben und weitere zukünftige Arbeitsmöglichkeiten finden können.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sie zeigen, dass Sie die standardisierten Cybersicherheitskonzepte kennen, die Sie durch den Erwerb der einzelnen Zertifizierungsarten erlernen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sie beweisen Ihr Engagement für ständiges Lernen, für die Aufrechterhaltung des aktuellen Wissensstand und für die berufliche Weiterentwicklung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sie unterstützen auch bei Verhandlungen zu Gehaltserhöhungen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Folgende fünf Cybersecurity-Zertifizierungen können Ihre Karriere fördern:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-cissp-zertifizierter-fachmann-fr-die-sicherheit-von-informationssystemen"&gt;1. CISSP – Zertifizierter Fachmann für die Sicherheit von Informationssystemen&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die &lt;a href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="CISSP-Zertifizierung"&gt;CISSP-Zertifizierung&lt;/a&gt;, die von ISC2, einer internationalen gemeinnützigen Vereinigung, angeboten wird, ist laut William Wetherill, CISO bei DefenseStorm, eine anerkannte Zertifizierung für Fachleute, die ein umfassendes Verständnis von IT-Security-Konzepten und Best Practices nachweisen wollen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Die Zertifizierung deckt ein breites Spektrum an Sicherheitsthemen ab. Zum Beispiel Anlagensicherheit, Sicherheitstechnik und Risikomanagement” führt der CISO aus. “Die CISSP-Zertifizierung hat einen höheren Standard, da sie von Sicherheitsexperten umfangreiche Berufserfahrung und eine Empfehlung von einem angesehenen ISC2-CISSP-Inhaber verlangt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die damit erworbenen Fähigkeiten sind laut Wetherill zudem entscheidend für die Entwicklung effektiver Sicherheitsstrategien und die Implementierung von Best Practices in der Rolle eines CISO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jay Martin, Security Practice Lead bei Blue Mantis, schließt sich dieser Meinung an: “Wenn Sie Ihre Karriere wirklich auf die nächste Stufe heben wollen, ist die CISSP-Zertifizierung das Nonplusultra”. Und Joe Evangelisto, CISO bei NetSPI, ergänzt, dass CISSP immer noch ein De-facto-Standard in der Branche ist und in allen Stellenbeschreibungen für CISOs aufgeführt ist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian Neuhaus, Americas CTO bei Vectra AI, stimmt zu, dass die CISSP-Zertifizierung für CISOs ganz oben auf der Liste stehen sollte. “Der Besitz eines solchen Zertifikats zeigt, dass ein Sicherheitsexperte mit dem Wissen und den technischen Fähigkeiten ausgestattet ist, die für die Implementierung und Verwaltung erstklassiger Sicherheitsprogramme erforderlich sind”, sagt er.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obwohl das CISSP-Zertifikat und ähnliche Zertifikate nicht einfach zu erlangen sind, sollten Security-Experten kontinuierlich darauf hinarbeiten, um ihre Karriere effektiv voranzutreiben, so Neuhaus. “Darüber hinaus kann die CISSP-Zertifizierung dazu beitragen, die Aufmerksamkeit von Arbeitgebern bei der Überprüfung von Lebensläufen auf sich zu lenken – und sich von anderen Bewerbern abzuheben”, fügt der Vectra-CTO hinzu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voraussetzungen:&lt;/strong&gt; Um diese Zertifizierung zu erhalten, müssen Sie die Prüfung bestehen und mindestens fünf Jahre kumulative, bezahlte Berufserfahrung in zwei oder mehr der acht Bereiche des ISC2 CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) vorweisen. Die Vorgabe der fünfjährigen Berufserfahrung kann durch andere Leistungen ersetzt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-ccsp-zertifizierter-fachmann-fr-cloud-sicherheit"&gt;2. CCSP – Zertifizierter Fachmann für Cloud-Sicherheit&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine neuere Zertifizierung von ISC2, die laut Sanjay Raja, VP of Product Solutions bei Gurucul entscheidend ist, ist der herstellerunabhängige &lt;a href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/ccsp" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Certified Cloud Security Professional"&gt;Certified Cloud Security Professional&lt;/a&gt;. “Die weltweit anerkannte CCSP-Zertifizierung weist nach, dass Sie über fortgeschrittenes technisches Fachwissen und Verständnis für die effektive Entwicklung, Überwachung und Sicherung von Daten, Anwendungen und Infrastrukturen in der Cloud verfügen”, erklärt Raja.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sie ähnelt der CISSP-Zertifizierung, ist aber stärker auf die Cloud-Sicherheit ausgerichtet – eine gute Wahl für CISOs, die Cloud-Technologien unterstützen oder intensiv nutzen”,.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voraussetzungen:&lt;/strong&gt; Um sich für diese Cybersecurity-Zertifizierung zu qualifizieren, müssen Sie die Prüfung bestehen und insgesamt mindestens fünf Jahre Berufserfahrung in der IT haben. Drei Jahre davon müssen im Bereich Informationssicherheit liegen und ein Jahr in einem oder mehreren der sechs Bereiche des ISC2 CCSP CBK. Auch hier kann die Vorgabe der fünfjährigen Berufserfahrung durch andere Leistungen ersetzt werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-zertifizierter-informationssicherheits-manager-cism"&gt;3. Zertifizierter Informationssicherheits-Manager (CISM)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Certified Information Security Manager (&lt;a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CertBAU&amp;amp;utm_content=sem_CertBAU_certificaiton-cism-eu-exam-google&amp;amp;cid=sem_2006842&amp;amp;Appeal=sem&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwte-vBhBFEiwAQSv_xWc7_9NRSnU5o1V18XGy2mP9Wb5B2y_6oMJn9OzXYzLTd-MmR2_PLBoCpcQQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="CISM"&gt;CISM&lt;/a&gt;), der von ISACA angeboten wird, stellt eine weitere wichtige Zertifizierung für CISO dar. Er wurde speziell für Fachleute entwickelt, die für die Verwaltung und Überwachung von Informationssicherheitsprogrammen verantwortlich sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Die CISM-Zertifizierung liefert wichtige Informationen darüber, wie man effektive Informationssicherheitsstrategien entwickelt und implementiert, die mit den Gesamtzielen des Unternehmens übereinstimmen, und deckt gleichzeitig eine breite Palette von Themen ab, wie Risikomanagement, Incident Management und Information Security Governance. Diese sind für die Rolle des CISO von entscheidender Bedeutung “, so Wetherill von DefenseStorm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Zertifizierung vermittelt die notwendigen Fähigkeiten und Kenntnisse, um Geschäftsabläufe und strenge Sicherheitsmaßnahmen in Einklang zu bringen, und konzentriert sich mehr auf Management- und Führungsfähigkeiten, während die CISSP-Zertifizierung eher technisch ausgerichtet ist. “Für CISOs bietet ISACA ebenfalls eine Reihe guter Zertifizierungen an, darunter CISM”, fügt Gurucul-Experte Raja hinzu. Diese Zertifizierung biete eine solide Reihe von Tools und Schulungen zur Verwaltung eines Programms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für CISOs, die sich mehr in Richtung Governance, Risiko und Compliance oder Sicherheitsmanagement orientieren, ist der CISM von ISACA sehr zu empfehlen, ergänzt Martin von Blue Mantis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voraussetzungen:&lt;/strong&gt; Um diese Zertifizierung zu erlangen, müssen Sie die Prüfung bestehen, sich innerhalb von fünf Jahren nach Bestehen der Prüfung um die Zertifizierung bewerben und fünf Jahre Berufserfahrung im Bereich Informationssicherheit vorweisen können. Sie müssen mindestens drei Jahre Berufserfahrung im Bereich IT-Security-Management in drei oder mehr der Analysebereiche der Berufspraxis haben. Ausnahmen und Substitutionen sind für das Kriterium fünf Jahre Berufserfahrung zulässig.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-zertifizierter-prfer-fr-informationssysteme-cisa"&gt;4. Zertifizierter Prüfer für Informationssysteme (CISA)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der &lt;a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CertBAU&amp;amp;utm_content=sem_CertBAU_certification-cisa-eu-exam-google&amp;amp;cid=sem_2006818&amp;amp;Appeal=sem&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwte-vBhBFEiwAQSv_xeDbeh-NdZD5xronrXNx9YYfgcF-09tm1t9mRMGGDmiF0yn7LE8x2xoCR0kQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Certified Information Systems Auditor"&gt;Certified Information Systems Auditor&lt;/a&gt; ist nach Meinung des DefenseStorm-CISO eine weitere wichtige Zertifizierung. Das ISACA bietet sie für Fachleute an, die für die Prüfung, Überwachung und Bewertung der Informationssicherheit und der Geschäftssysteme ihrer Unternehmen verantwortlich sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Die CISA-Zertifizierung ist weltweit anerkannt und in der IT-Branche hoch angesehen. Sie verlangt von Fachleuten, dass sie ihre Kenntnisse und Fähigkeiten in den Bereichen Informationssicherheitsprüfung, -kontrolle und -sicherung nachweisen”, so Wetherill. “Die CISA-Zertifizierung vermittelt ein umfassendes Verständnis dafür, wie man Schwachstellen und Risiken im Bereich der Informationssicherheit erkennt, analysiert und bewertet.” Diese Fähigkeiten seien für einen CISO unerlässlich, um seine Arbeit effektiv auszuführen und sein Unternehmen vor Cyber-Bedrohungen zu schützen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Einige Zertifizierungen, wie zum Beispiel der CISA, eignen sich besser für spezialisierte Sicherheitsaufgaben, wie die eines Wirtschaftsprüfers”, kommentiert Corey Nachreiner, CSO bei WatchGuard Technologies. “Der CISA von ISACA ist hilfreich, wenn Sie sich auf die Prüfung der Cybersicherheit eines Unternehmens konzentrieren.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voraussetzungen:&lt;/strong&gt; Um diese Zertifizierung zu erhalten, müssen Sie die Prüfung bestehen und sich innerhalb von fünf Jahren nach Bestehen der Prüfung um die Zertifizierung bewerben. Außerdem müssen Sie mindestens fünf Jahre Berufserfahrung in der Prüfung, Kontrolle oder Sicherheit von Informationssystemen vorweisen können. Mindestens zwei Jahre davon müssen aus den CISA-Praxisbereichen stammen. Ausnahmen und Substitutionen sind für die fünfjährige Anforderung zulässig.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-giac-strategische-planung-politik-und-fhrung-gstrt"&gt;5. GIAC Strategische Planung, Politik und Führung (GSTRT)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die &lt;a href="https://www.giac.org/certifications/cyber-incident-leader-gcil/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GIAC-Zertifizierung&lt;/a&gt; für strategische Planung, Politik und Führung, die vom SANS Institute angeboten wird, zeigt, dass Sie über das Wissen und die Fähigkeiten verfügen, um den nächsten Schritt in Ihrer Karriere zu machen, und zwar mit der Fähigkeit, strategische Pläne zu erstellen, die auf das Unternehmen abgestimmt sind, sagt Frank Kim, Fellow am Sans Institute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wenn Sie über die technischen Details hinausgehen müssen, um effektiver mit der Geschäftsleitung und dem Vorstand zu kommunizieren, zeigt diese Zertifizierung, dass Sie wissen, wie man sich an strategischen Zielen ausrichtet, eine Roadmap erstellt, einen Business Case aufbaut, eine Sicherheitsrichtlinie erstellt und Ihr Team zum Erfolg führt”, erklärt er.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voraussetzungen:&lt;/strong&gt; Um diese Zertifizierung zu erhalten, müssen Sie eine entsprechende Prüfung bestehen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="auch-in-deutschland-besonders-gefragt"&gt;Auch in Deutschland besonders gefragt&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insgesamt sind die oben genannten Zertifizierungen schon sehr sinnvoll”, fasst Ron Kneffel, Vorstandsvorsitzender der CISO Alliance, zusammen. “Alle haben einen starken Bezug zur IT Sicherheit – unabhängig von einem Standard oder einer Norm. Die Zertifizierungen sind auch in Deutschland sehr anerkannt und werden gerade im Konzernumfeld immer wieder als Nachweis der Fachkunde gefordert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es sei wichtig zu wissen, dass Zertifikate zwar nicht zwingend erforderlich sind, um eine Karriere im Bereich der Cybersicherheit zu machen, so Neuhaus. “Aber die darin enthaltenen Informationen können von unschätzbarem Wert sein, um sich in der Branche zurechtzufinden. Der Vectra AI-CTO fügt hinzu: “Daher sind gefragte Talente im Bereich der Cybersicherheit nicht auf die Anzahl der Zertifizierungen beschränkt”. Trotzdem sollten CISOs die anderen Qualitäten, Stärken und Attribute außerhalb der Zertifizierungen nicht aus den Augen verlieren, schließt Neuhaus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesetipp:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492970/5-top-ciso-qualitaten-das-brauchen-sie-um-ein-next-gen-ciso-zu-werden.html" target="_blank" title="Das brauchen Sie, um ein „next-gen“ CISO zu werden"&gt;Das brauchen Sie, um ein „next-gen“ CISO zu werden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enterprises still aren’t getting IAM right</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114758/enterprises-still-arent-getting-iam-right-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite all the warnings, and constant news of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110008/top-cyber-threats-to-your-ai-systems-and-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"&gt;devastating cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt;, enterprise users are still cutting corners when it comes to identity and access management (IAM).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly two-thirds (63%) of cybersecurity leaders admit their employees continue to bypass security controls so they can work faster, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cyberark.com/press/new-study-only-1-of-organizations-have-fully-adopted-just-in-time-privileged-access-as-ai-driven-identities-rapidly-increase/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; by security company CyberArk. Furthermore, enterprises are struggling to establish access policies for emerging AI agents and other agentic tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This seems to strongly implicate identity and privilege control as central to operational risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The data points to a cultural pattern where immediate productivity wins often outweigh long‑term security posture,” said  &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charleshchu" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Chu&lt;/a&gt;, GM of IT and developer solutions at CyberArk. “It is clear that security is still perceived as something that slows people down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="privileged-access-management-inadequate"&gt;Privileged access management inadequate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CyberArk surveyed 500 leaders involved in privileged access management (PAM) in identity and infrastructure roles, including DevOps engineers, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110151/cybersecurity-leaders-resolutions-for-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;security managers&lt;/a&gt;, cloud security architects, database managers, site reliability and software engineers, and IT support specialists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They report that in their organizations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just 1% have fully implemented a modern just-in-time (JIT) privileged access model;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;91% say at least half of their privileged access is always-on (standard privilege), providing unrestricted, persistent access to sensitive systems;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;45% apply the same privileged access controls to human and AI identities;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;33% lack clear AI access policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also revealed a growing issue with “shadow privilege,” accounts and secrets that are unmanaged, unnecessary, and unknown to cybersecurity leaders. CyberArk found that 54% of organizations uncover these types of accounts and secrets every week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This suggests that access ownership is “diffuse,” Chu noted. “If no one feels responsible for continuously pruning and governing privileged access, it naturally accumulates. Added to that is the fact that the majority of organizations (88%) manage multiple identity tools, which “creates confusion about who has authority and which system is the source of truth.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-riskiest-human-behaviors"&gt;The riskiest human behaviors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CyberArk identified several of the riskiest human behaviors in access management, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copying credentials into personal password managers, chat apps, or email, because the “official” process is slower.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spinning up cloud resources or test environments with privileged access outside central controls.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Using shared admin accounts or recycling similar passwords/tokens across systems and environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leaving always-on access in place “just in case,” even when those elevated privileges are only required occasionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Employees bypass controls for very human reasons,” Chu acknowledged. “They’re under pressure to move fast, and the security tools that they are required to use are often not user-friendly and conflict with how they actually get work done.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This leads to ad‑hoc local admin creation, and long‑lived IAM roles and API keys that “no one revisits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is only exacerbating the problems. Users paste keys, logs, or configuration files into AI tools, unintentionally exposing secrets, Chu noted. AI can also deploy apps and alter systems faster than existing controls can keep up, so engineers tend to work around the controls. Further, AI systems and agents are increasingly acting on behalf of users in ways not yet fully visible to security teams. This makes risky shortcuts even more difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The net effect is that the gap between what the policy says and what actually happens in production is widening,” said Chu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="give-ai-agents-unique-identities"&gt;Give AI agents unique identities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: AI agents operate quite differently than human users. As well being speedier, they work continuously and touch multiple systems and data sets in a single workflow. They present a unique risk because they can very quickly execute large numbers of privileged actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, security teams should treat AI agents as distinct identities with their own access controls, Chu advised. Every individual agent should be assigned a dedicated identity and credentials, with tightly-scoped permissions for specific systems and data sets. Short-lived tokens should take the place of long-lived keys, and elevated rights should only be granted just in time, and for specific tasks. Further, all actions taken by AI agents should be logged and attributable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as with humans, reduced standing access, better visibility, and strong governance must be “applied explicitly and consistently” to AI, Chu noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="jit-is-hard-to-implement"&gt;JIT is hard to implement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JIT is a technique that grants select permissions only when required, for a specific purpose, and for a limited period of time. When users or systems request access, they receive a “time-bound and scope-limited” set of privileges, allowing them perform the required task, then automatically “return to a lower baseline.” Chu explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every step is logged so that organizations can see who or what has powerful access and why,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But JIT remains difficult to realize in practice, Chu noted, resulting in a heavy reliance on standing privileges, even as enterprises are fully aware of how risky that practice is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A number of factors are to blame, he said: IT teams can be hesitant to make changes to legacy systems for fear of disruption, and complex IT environments comprising on-premises infrastructure, multiple clouds, and SaaS applications can complicate implementation. Some teams also worry that JIT can slow down incident response or other routine practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adding to the challenges, existing cybersecurity tools haven’t been designed for highly complex enterprise environments, Chu said. “That combination points to fragmentation: There is plenty of tooling, but not enough unified visibility and control.” .&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-enterprises-can-protect-themselves"&gt;How enterprises can protect themselves&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s enterprises need security that is built around centralized identity, least privilege, and automation, Chu emphasized. This means strong single sign‑on (SSO) with multi‑factor authentication (MFA) and contextual policies; modern secret management for passwords, keys, and tokens for both humans and machines; privileged access capabilities that can issue short‑lived access on demand with full logging; and analytics that stitch together activity across human accounts, service accounts, and AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a cultural perspective, organizations should establish clearer ownership of identity and privilege management, shared goals, and top-down messaging around &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110699/8-things-cisos-cant-afford-to-get-wrong-in-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;cybersecurity practices&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, critically, organizations must adopt tools that easily integrate into existing processes and workflows, thus reducing friction and reducing user workarounds. “The key to effective implementation is to make security as invisible as possible to the user as they do their daily work,” Chu asserted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jamie Norton’s journey to CISO started with an early interest in computers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4098274/jamie-nortons-early-interest-in-computers-took-him-on-a-journey-securing-key-australian-government-organizations.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jamie Norton’s parents gave him a computer as a child that he played and tinkered with while growing up. When he went to university, he studied IT and accounting “just as a bit of a side note, really.” This was right around when the internet was emerging, and he started to play with Unix and other operating systems with software development as his background.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he left university, he didn’t know what he was going to pursue in tech, but the Dotcom boom presented a range of technology opportunities, and his first role was in intelligence for Defence. “And that was where I started to get the mind thinking more in security terms,” he tells CSO of those early days for the department in the tech security space. “But the concepts of risk and the concepts of protecting networks and some of the fundamentals were there.” And that was when Norton first realized that cybersecurity could be a career opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around 2000, Norton “formally dropped into” cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I started out post defence, was on the vendor side and some startups. Went through a period of really strong digital trust systems, authentication, identity and then moved into more mainstream and early cyber leadership roles.” Norton also had several sales roles midcareer, before working his way back to cyber leadership roles with a “return back to consulting more recently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His cybersecurity career has included stints with the World Health Organization, NEC Australia, and the Australian Taxation Office. Today he is vice chair of the board of directors at ISACA and the CISO at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSO spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamienorton/?originalSubdomain=au"&gt;Jamie Norton&lt;/a&gt; about cybersecurity challenges in finance and government and about retaining talent. Following is that conversation, edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the key challenges that cybersecurity leaders face today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton:&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously, it’s a very complex space, but at the same time there are foundational things that shift the needle a long way. Part of the challenge for CISOs is how to get that foundational hygiene into organizations. Legacy environments, that’s probably the biggest challenge, particularly in government. Trying to secure systems that are old and out of date, no longer being updated and require significant investment to shift the security posture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But sitting on top of that is the concept of broad hygiene across the environment, and just doing the basics can be really challenging. There’s a process element to that, there’s obviously a technology element, but then there’s a human element to that as well. So, it’s trying to get all of those bases aligned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, AI and a whole range of things are emerging that are going to be huge, and we don’t really know what 10 years in from now is going to look like, maybe even five years. Things are changing so rapidly and as technology and security people we want to be innovative and move quickly and be at the forefront of this because otherwise there’s a risk you get left behind. But we must do it in a safe manner so we’re not accidentally exposing sensitive information. That’s a challenge as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your experience as a cybersecurity leader, what does cybersecurity usually mean to organizations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;It varies. It certainly has changed over time and between organizations. It does depend on size and scale but also a lot depends on the board and the executive security mindset as well. In mid to large government agencies, there’s a real focus on cybersecurity at the executive level. And there’s strong policy and frameworks as well, such as the PSPF [Protective Security Policy Framework] and other frameworks and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the corporate space it varies considerably. We’ve seen even some large organizations where it has been a bit of a struggle getting the executives and board functions to accept accountability for security risk. They’re just taking a little bit longer than perhaps others that have been championing security for some time. I think with what’s happening in the market, the broader regulation, the general level of communication around security that’s happening in the media and otherwise, and the incidents is the other thing, the cost of those incidents, like the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573731/a-third-of-australian-population-likely-affected-in-optus-cyberattack.html"&gt;OPTUS’s&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574049/medibank-hackers-revealed-to-be-in-russia.html"&gt;Medibank’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4014787/scattered-spider-shifts-focus-to-airlines-as-strikes-hit-hawaiian-westjet-and-now-qantas.html"&gt;Qantas&lt;/a&gt; most recently. I think that’s turning that tide with increasing focus on effective cyber governance. I think there’s more and more support emerging at the highest levels of organizations — the executive leadership team and directors — which will enable us to shift the needle even further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you keep your team inspired to prevent cybersecurity professionals from leaving?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;In government, we often don’t have quite the same level of compensation as in the corporate space, so we try to create a positive culture and environment that people love to work in. My personal goal is to provide mentorship and advice to the team while also being very transparent about what career options look like and what the industry is like in different areas. I am my team’s strongest advocate in terms of helping them find their path and achieve career ambitions, whether this is within government or not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Try to cut red tape. It’s difficult sometimes but try to minimise the impacts of those sorts of things. Training is probably a key lever to give people that advantage and being able to educate and learn further in their careers as well as exposure to some exciting technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mission element in government is also critical. We often attract individuals that are very mission-focused and pursue success that’s bigger than themselves. They’re trying to achieve something for the country or for a certain area of the of the economy. That’s a key outcome we offer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But equally there’s an element, particularly in the graduate and early career stage that we know we’re often an incubator for the next step in their career. And I think being comfortable with that concept is not a bad thing. Yes, they might come in, we’ll get some great innovation from them for the first three to five years of their careers, they’ll get some training and support from us and then they may go into the private sector for a bit, but they may come back to government later. I think it’s a bit of a push pull across the economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do you see the role of the cybersecurity leader going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;Innovations like AI are going to fundamentally impact the role and our day-to-day activities. There’ll be some aspects that won’t change, but there’ll be a lot of aspects that are going to morph and change over the next little while. As an industry, we’re still evolving away from being seen as a purely tech-related function and sitting more naturally alongside the risk function. It’s not happening in every organization, but it’s already happening across financial services. I’m hopeful that we’ll start to see that trend in government, where security sits with the chief operating officer or chief risk officer, depending on the organization, which removes that very tech lens and conflicts that represents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the role itself has changed significantly over the last 20-25 years and from a very technical beginnings to now being much more of a C-level interfacing with the board and the executive [suite]. That’s going to continue and we are starting to see a lot more directors with at least some cybersecurity expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What questions should CISOs be asking themselves that they often overlook in securing organizations today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;I think asking yourself, what visibility do you actually have and how confident are you that your view of things is either the correct view and will still be the correct view in three months?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you most and least proud of in your career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;I feel the work I’m doing with ISACA has real impact and legacy, with an ambitious agenda of industry-wide, global initiatives that we believe will improve the industry for professionals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of mistakes there’s been lots. I’m in that fail fast and learn category. Government’s not always been in that space, the executive mindset’s a little bit different so it’s fair to say I’ve had my fair share of failures and fair share of presentations that didn’t land. But I think that the messaging really is that: As a CISO, you can’t be perfectly prepared from day one. When you start a role — a significant one or in a midsized organization — you’re going to have to learn to respond and recover and go back again and not always going to impress everyone along the way because sometimes you have to deliver a tough message. A lot of the challenge of being a CISO is building an effective narrative and gaining the trust of your ELT and board, so they are fully invested and you can deliver the difficult messages when needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also about building the resilience because it can be lonely at times. Sometimes you’re going to be the one who’s catching flak from some executives because they’re not happy with your message that impacts them. I think that’s why &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3631614/cybersecurity-is-tough-4-steps-leaders-can-take-now-to-reduce-team-burnout.html"&gt;cyber burnout&lt;/a&gt; is such a problem. It’s often taking all the body blows and getting to a point where you’re just like “I don’t want to do this anymore.” A lot of that comes back to organizational culture and hopefully having an organization that’s very supportive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think AI will widen the skills gap or help cybersecurity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;I think there’s definitely some roles in cyber that will change significantly over the next 5-10 years and some that may diminish. I think it’s going to impact other parts of the economy in a more profound way. From a tech perspective, I think a lot of the data analytics and some of the decision-making support systems will more and more become something that AI supports and begins to automate. So they’ll start off as more decision support systems where we’ll need less humans because we’re able to get the information we need more quickly out of an AI and then slowly but surely, with agentic AI and what’s coming, that will allow them to make simple decisions and then slightly more complex, and then over time, I think we’ll start to replace some roles. I’m optimistic this will propel human workers further up the value chain as well; they’ll be further up from a leadership perspective, maybe deeper from a deeply technical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any saying that you live by?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;When I was in the Tax Office our commissioner at the time, Chris Jordan, had a branding which was “Do the basics brilliantly” and it’s stuck with me as a general mantra, but it applies so well to security because if you do the basics well you would have such a significant uplift in your cyber capability. You can’t just focus on that alone because there’s a lot of other moving parts. But if you can’t get those basics right, that’s going to provide a lot of protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other one I like, which I guess has helped me well, and I think it’s still true is the futility of “repeating the same thing over and over again, while expecting a different result.” That applies in a lot of things. You’ve got to try and change things up if you’re expecting to get a different result. Yet I see it so often in many facets of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any tips for those wanting to begin a career in cybersecurity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norton: &lt;/strong&gt;For graduates and for early career cyber people we’re aware it is challenging transitioning into early-stage career and getting that first job. I think tenacity and drive is a critical attribute and I’m aware that’s easy for me to say from here. But I do see that those that are persistent, engaged, reach out and grab what they can in a proactive way, they might get knocked down a few times, but you know they’ll continue to learn. They might join ISACA. They might do an early certification to try and get a little competitive advantage. More often than not the relationships formed by networking and getting involved, putting yourself out there, result in opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At more senior levels it becomes harder. I think it’s that learning process again, making sure that you’ve got a CV that demonstrates that you’re building capability. Understanding your brand and honing it professionally. So, polishing the CV to really reflect what your brand is and what you bring to the table is key. You can’t just throw the same tired CV out and scatter it and hope that something’s going to bite, because that might have worked when we had scarcity but these days there’s too much supply in the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>CrowdStrike to acquire SGNL for $740M, expanding real-time identity security</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4114957/crowdstrike-to-acquire-sgnl-for-740m-expanding-real-time-identity-security.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike will pay $740 million to acquire identity security startup SGNL, adding real-time authorization capabilities that grant and revoke access based on current risk conditions rather than static permissions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The deal, expected to close in CrowdStrike’s fiscal first quarter ending April 30, will be paid mostly in cash with some stock subject to vesting, &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/press-releases/crowdstrike-to-acquire-sgnl-to-transform-identity-security-for-ai-era/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CrowdStrike said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SGNL’s technology sits between identity providers and resources, evaluating access requests using contextual data, including user behavior, device posture, and threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The acquisition reflects growing concern about non-human identities such as service accounts, API keys, and AI agents that operate with broad permissions across cloud environments. Machine identities now outnumber human identities by as much as 82 to 1 in some environments, according to industry estimates cited by Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI agents operate with superhuman speed and access, making every agent a privileged identity that must be protected,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="filling-a-capability-gap"&gt;Filling a capability gap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CrowdStrike is adding SGNL’s capabilities to address this risk. The technology works with existing identity systems from Okta, Microsoft, and AWS rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t just consolidation — it fills a real gap in dynamic, risk-aware authorization,” said Meng Liu, senior analyst at Forrester. “As AI agents and insider threats rise, static IAM is no longer enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach differs from traditional identity and access management, which typically authenticates users at login and relies on periodic access reviews. SGNL evaluates access continuously, revoking privileges immediately when conditions change. For instance, if CrowdStrike’s Falcon platform detects suspicious endpoint activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“SGNL offers continuous, contextual authorization that can make split-second decisions based on real-time signals, something traditional IAM systems have struggled with,” said Apeksha Kaushik, principal analyst at Gartner. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 25% of enterprise breaches will be traced to AI agent abuse from both external and malicious internal actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysts argue that the acquisition will not make CrowdStrike a competitor for IAM platforms. “This fills a specific capability gap around real-time identity threat detection and enforcement, an area where traditional IAM platforms are comparatively static,” said Arjun Chauhan, practice director at Everest Group. “Microsoft and Okta primarily own identity lifecycle management, authentication, and access governance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="market-consolidation-accelerates"&gt;Market consolidation accelerates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $740 million price reflects broader consolidation as cybersecurity vendors race to expand identity capabilities. The deal marks the latest in a wave of identity security acquisitions as platform vendors expand beyond core products. Liu compared the move to Palo Alto Networks’ acquisition of CyberArk in 2025, noting both vendors are racing to combine detection and enforcement into a single platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identity has become the center of gravity in cybersecurity,” said John Paul Cunningham, CISO at Silverfort. “We’re seeing clear segmentation emerge: pure identity security players, hybrid vendors trying to bolt identity into existing products, and large platform companies like Palo Alto Networks and now CrowdStrike expanding as part of broader security ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identity security market is expected to grow from approximately $29 billion in 2025 to $56 billion by 2029, according to IDC data cited by CrowdStrike. The $740 million price follows &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1646566/noteworthy-technology-acquisitions-2021.html"&gt;Okta’s $6.5 billion purchase of Auth0&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571851/top-cybersecurity-manda-deals-for-2022.html"&gt;Thoma Bravo’s $2.3 billion take-private of ForgeRock&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SGNL was founded by former Google employees and raised approximately $75 million from Costanoa Ventures and CRV before the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-adoption-questions"&gt;Enterprise adoption questions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether continuous authorization becomes standard practice depends partly on how rapidly non-human identities proliferate. “The urgency is real, but uneven across enterprises,” Chauhan said. “In client conversations, we increasingly see interest in adaptive and continuous authorization, especially in regulated industries, digital-native enterprises, and organizations with high levels of third-party or machine identity access.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most enterprises are not replacing traditional IAM. “Instead, they are layering real-time controls on top of existing IAM to address gaps around insider risk, session-level anomalies, and post-authentication compromise,” Chauhan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The practical challenge is defining policies that adapt to dynamic conditions. Unlike role-based access control, continuous authorization requires organizations to establish baseline behavior patterns and acceptable risk thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integration details remain unclear. CrowdStrike has not disclosed when SGNL capabilities will be available to Falcon customers, whether they require additional licensing, or what changes to existing IAM configurations may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is part of CrowdStrike’s platform expansion spree following the &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3476789/crowdstrike-failure-what-you-need-to-know.html"&gt;July 2024 software update incident&lt;/a&gt; that caused widespread Windows system outages. The company reported fiscal third-quarter annual recurring revenue of $4 billion in December, up 25% year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This should primarily be viewed as long-term platform expansion rather than a short-term recovery signal,” Chauhan said. “CrowdStrike has been steadily positioning itself as a broader cybersecurity platform for several years. The acquisition reinforces that trajectory and helps reduce overreliance on endpoint security alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edge computing is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a reality shaping mission-critical operations across defense, utilities and public safety. Rugged IoT devices, engineered to withstand extreme conditions, are the backbone of this transformation. They enable real-time decision-making in environments where traditional IT infrastructure cannot survive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this progress comes with risk. These devices often operate outside secure perimeters, in disconnected environments and under physical stress. Unlike enterprise systems, rugged IoT deployments break the assumptions of conventional cybersecurity models: stable connectivity, frequent patching and controlled environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CIOs and IT leaders, rugged IoT security isn’t just a technical challenge, it’s a business-critical priority. The cost of failure is measured in millions of dollars, regulatory penalties and reputational damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-business-stakes"&gt;The business stakes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity failures at the edge have cascading consequences. The following examples give a sense of the impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense:&lt;/strong&gt; Compromised devices can leak mission-critical data or disrupt tactical communications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilities:&lt;/strong&gt; Operational paralysis halts power distribution or water treatment, impacting millions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency response systems fail during crises, endangering lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Gartner, in 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/press/zscaler-threatlabz-finds-400-increase-iot-and-ot-malware-attacks-year-over-year-underscoring"&gt;IoT-related incidents in critical infrastructure surged 400% over the previous three years&lt;/a&gt; and the average cost of an OT breach exceeded $3 million. This excluded reputational damage and compliance fines. For CIOs, this isn’t just about security, it’s about business continuity, compliance and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-rugged-iot-is-different"&gt;Why rugged IoT is different&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Securing rugged IoT devices requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional IT systems. Conventional cybersecurity models are built on assumptions that rarely hold true in edge environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional IT assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous network access for monitoring and patching.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlled environments:&lt;/strong&gt; Secure, climate-controlled data centers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent patching:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular updates to address vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Unified visibility across systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rugged IoT reality:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harsh conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Devices operate at extreme temperatures, dust, moisture and vibration. These conditions accelerate hardware wear and complicate maintenance schedules.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Edge devices often rely on unreliable or low-bandwidth links. Real-time patching and centralized monitoring become impractical, leaving systems exposed for longer periods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational constraints:&lt;/strong&gt; Many rugged devices run unattended for years in remote or hazardous locations. Physical access for updates or repairs is limited, increasing reliance on secure remote workflows.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legacy integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Rugged IoT frequently coexists with outdated operational technology (OT) systems that lack modern security controls. This creates vulnerabilities at integration points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These factors dismantle the foundation of traditional security strategies. CIOs cannot assume continuous oversight or rapid response capabilities. Instead, rugged IoT demands adaptive, decentralized security architectures that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operate effectively in disconnected environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Combine physical security with cyber protection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Support offline patching and secure update chains.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Incorporate &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final"&gt;zero-trust principles&lt;/a&gt; even in bandwidth-constrained scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="standards-helpful-but-insufficient"&gt;Standards: Helpful but insufficient&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Industry frameworks such as &lt;a href="https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards"&gt;ISA/IEC 62443&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/82/r2/final"&gt;NIST SP 800-82&lt;/a&gt; remain essential for guiding industrial cybersecurity, but their applicability to rugged IoT environments is limited. While these standards provide a strong foundation, they were designed for predictable, connected infrastructures, not for devices operating in remote, harsh and intermittently connected conditions. Standards fall short for rugged IoT in numerous aspects:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity dependency:&lt;/strong&gt; Both frameworks assume continuous network availability for monitoring, patching and compliance validation. Rugged deployments often operate offline for extended periods, making real-time adherence impossible.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical security blind spot:&lt;/strong&gt; ISA/IEC and NIST primarily address logical and network security layers, leaving physical protection underemphasized. Rugged devices deployed in the field face risks of theft, tampering and environmental damage that these standards do not fully address.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity and cost:&lt;/strong&gt; Full implementation of these frameworks can be resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise and significant investment. For organizations with constrained budgets or distributed assets, achieving full compliance may be impractical.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static approach vs. dynamic reality:&lt;/strong&gt; Standards are prescriptive and slow to evolve, while rugged IoT environments demand adaptive strategies that respond to changing operational conditions and emerging threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compliance is a starting point, not the finish line. CIOs should adapt these frameworks for edge conditions, integrate physical hardening and prioritize risk-based implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="best-practices-for-cios"&gt;Best practices for CIOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Securing rugged IoT devices requires a multi-layered, defense-in-depth approach that aligns with enterprise priorities and addresses the unique challenges of edge environments. Each layer plays a critical role in reducing risk and ensuring operational continuity:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-device-hardening"&gt;1. Device hardening&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The foundation of rugged IoT security begins at the device level. Implement secure boot to ensure devices only run trusted firmware by validating cryptographic signatures during startup. Encrypt storage to protect sensitive operational data and credentials from unauthorized access, even if the device is physically compromised. Reduce the attack surface by disabling unused interfaces such as USB or serial ports and turning off unnecessary services. Additionally, schedule periodic firmware integrity checks to detect tampering or unauthorized modifications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-access-control"&gt;2. Access control&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strong identity and access management are essential for field-deployed devices. Multifactor authentication (MFA) should be required for administrative access, even in low-bandwidth environments, using token-based or offline-capable solutions. Role-based access control (RBAC) aligned with ISA/IEC 62443 principles ensures least-privilege access for technicians, operators and remote administrators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further strengthen security, automate credential rotation to prevent password or key reuse across devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-network-security"&gt;3. Network security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Connectivity at the edge is often intermittent and insecure, demanding robust network protections. Adopt a zero-trust architecture to authenticate every device and transaction, regardless of network location. Use lightweight VPN protocols optimized for unreliable links to maintain confidentiality without degrading performance. For critical operations, consider secure connectivity options such as FirstNet or private 5G to reduce exposure to public networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, segment IoT traffic from enterprise networks to contain potential breaches and limit lateral movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-physical-security"&gt;4. Physical security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity must be complemented by physical safeguards to protect devices in harsh environments. Deploy tamper-evident seals to detect unauthorized access attempts quickly and use ruggedized enclosures to shield devices from environmental stressors and physical attacks. Secure mounting reduces theft risk by anchoring devices in fixed installations, while sensor-based alerts, such as accelerometers or intrusion sensors, can trigger notifications when devices are moved or opened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-life-cycle-management"&gt;5. Life cycle management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security is not a one-time effort; it spans the entire device life cycle. Regular patching and OS hardening are essential to maintain compliance with frameworks like &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis"&gt;CJIS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/federal-information-security-modernization-act"&gt;FISMA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html"&gt;HIPAA&lt;/a&gt;. Develop offline update workflows for disconnected environments, ensuring cryptographic validation of update packages. Strengthen supply chain security by validating firmware and hardware integrity during procurement and deployment to prevent compromised components. Finally, implement secure end-of-life sanitization processes to wipe data and decommission devices safely, preventing residual data leaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-remote-management"&gt;6. Remote management&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remote capabilities are critical for mitigating risks in inaccessible locations. Enable remote lock and wipe functions to respond immediately to lost or stolen devices, even over intermittent connections. Use centralized management dashboards to maintain visibility into device health, patch status and overall security posture across distributed deployments. Configure automated alerts for anomalies such as unauthorized access attempts or connectivity failures to ensure timely intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-impact-roi-and-risk"&gt;Enterprise impact: ROI and risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, investing in rugged IoT security isn’t just a cost; it’s a risk mitigation strategy. CIOs need to consider:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downtime costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilities report losses of $500,000 per hour during outages, according to the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-compliance with CJIS or HIPAA can result in fines exceeding $1 million.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reputation:&lt;/strong&gt; Public safety failures erode trust and brand equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CIOs, the message is clear: Rugged IoT security is not just an IT issue, it’s a business imperative. The cost of inaction is measured not only in dollars but in operational continuity and human safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="future-outlook"&gt;Future outlook&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging technologies and developments will further reshape rugged IoT security:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI-driven anomaly detection for real-time threat identification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Predictive maintenance aligning security patches with hardware health.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regulatory evolution (&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"&gt;CISA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cybersecurity-act"&gt;EU Cybersecurity Act&lt;/a&gt;) enforcing stricter compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forward-thinking CIOs should start integrating these capabilities into their edge strategies today. Rugged IoT deployments are mission-critical and increasingly targeted by cyberthreats. Securing these environments requires a shift from traditional IT models to adaptive strategies tailored for the edge.&lt;/p&gt;
