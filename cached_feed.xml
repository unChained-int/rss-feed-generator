      <title>CERN: how does the international research institution manage risk?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109133/cern-how-does-an-international-research-institution-manage-risk.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are few research institutions in the world with the size and scope of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. Founded in 1954 by 12 European countries, the &lt;a href="https://home.cern/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;European Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics&lt;/a&gt; is located in the Swiss town of Meyrin, in the canton of Geneva, although its facilities extend along the Franco-Swiss border. Among them is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world’s largest particle accelerator. International collaboration is at the core of its origin: more than 3,500 people make up its permanent staff. A small village that expands to 17,000 when adding the scientific staff of around 950 institutions from more than 80 different countries that collaborate on projects at the center. In this homegrown ecosystem, IT risk management poses a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The main problem is that we are managing a huge organization,” explains Stefan Lüders, CERN’s CISO. “We are one of the most important particle physics research institutes on the planet. We do sophisticated and interesting things, which makes us a target for attacks from different communities.” He lists several of these potential threats: &lt;em&gt;script kiddies&lt;/em&gt; or hackers with basic knowledge, who all pose a potential security risk; ransomware or data exfiltration; sabotage of CERN’s work; espionage actions and criminal groups trying to infiltrate through computers or other devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is where people come in. Because we have a very large, heterogeneous and very fluctuating research community. There are many physicists who join the organization every year. They come in and leave to do their PhD, do research at CERN and then leave,” he describes, pointing to the challenge of “taking care of this community of users. The other challenge is the flexible and fast-developing world of IT.” This includes programming — importing open-source libraries, their security, etc. — and AI. “The more sophisticated AI becomes, the greater the likelihood that those AI-driven security or attack tools will try to infiltrate the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="securing-cern"&gt;Securing CERN&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How do you ensure effective implementation of cybersecurity initiatives that don’t disrupt scientific work? “You can’t,” Lüders asserts. “Cybersecurity is inconvenient. Let’s face it.” Lüders equates it to locking your front door or using your PIN to get cash out of the ATM; they can be annoying, but necessary. “We try to explain to our community why security measures are needed,” he says. “And if we adapt our security measures to our environment, people adopt them. Yes, it makes the research a little more complicated, but only a little.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lüders insists on the research work factor. “We are not a bank. We don’t have billions of dollars. We are not a military base, which means we don’t have to protect a country. We do research, which means adapting the level of security and the level of academic freedom so that the two go hand in hand. And that’s an ongoing conversation with our user community.” This ranges from scientific personnel to industrial control systems management, IT or human resources. “To meet this challenge, it is essential to talk to people. That’s why, I insist, cybersecurity is a very sociological issue: talking to people, explaining to them why we do this.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, not everyone willingly uses multifactor authentication because “let’s face it, they’re a pain. It’s much easier to type in a password, and who even wants to type in a password? You just want to log in. But for protection needs, today we have passwords and multifactor authentication. So you explain to people what you’re protecting. We tell them why it’s important to protect their work, as well as research results. And the vast majority understand that you need a certain level of security,” he says. “But it’s a challenge because there are so many different cultures here, different nationalities, different opinions and thoughts, and different backgrounds. That’s what we are constantly trying to adapt to.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stefan Lüders, CISO del CERN y Tim Bell, líder de la sección de gobernanza, riesgo y cumplimiento de TI del CERN" class="wp-image-4081255" height="263" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Stefan-Luders-CISO-del-CERN-y-Tim-Bell-lider-de-la-seccion-de-gobernanza-riesgo-y-cumplimiento-de-TI-del-CERN.png" width="554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefan Lüders and Tim Bell of CERN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CERN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Employing proprietary technology can introduce risks, according to Tim Bell, leader of CERN’s IT governance, risk and compliance section, who is responsible for business continuity and disaster recovery. “If you’re a visitor to a university, you’ll want to bring your laptop and use it at CERN. We can’t afford to remove these electronic devices upon arrival at the facility. It would be incompatible with the nature of the organization. The implication is that we must be able to implement BYOD-type security measures.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because at the core of everything always remains the collaborative nature of CERN. “Academic papers, open science, freedom of research, are part of our core&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Cybersecurity needs to adapt to this,” Lüders notes. “We have 200,000 devices on our network that are BYOD.” How then does the adaptation of cyber protection apply? “It’s called defense in depth,” explains the CISO. “We can’t install anything on these end devices because they don’t belong to us, (…) but we have network monitoring.” In this way, even if you don’t have direct access to each device, you are warned when something is being done against the center’s policies, both at the level of cybersecurity and inappropriate uses, such as employing the technology they provide for particular interests.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These measures also extend to obsolete systems, which the organization is able to assimilate because they have a network resilient enough that even if one piece of equipment is compromised, it won’t damage any other CERN systems. The legacy technology problem extends to the equipment needed for the physics experiments being performed at the center. “These are protected by dedicated networks, which allows the network protection to kick in and protect them against any kind of abuse,” Lüders explains. On IoT connected devices not designed with cybersecurity in mind, “a problem for all industries,” Lüders is blunt: “You will never get security in IoT devices.” His solution is to connect them to restricted network segments where they are not allowed to communicate with anything else, and then define destinations to which they can communicate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="general-framework"&gt;General framework&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is part of a larger challenge: aligning the IT and OT sides so that security continuity is established throughout the organization. A challenge that goes through centralization. “Today the OT part, the controls systems at CERN, are using IT virtualization,” explains Lüders. “The strategy is to bring IT and control people together so that the control people can use the IT services to their advantage. From the technology department, a central system is provided with different functionalities for operations, as well as for other areas of the organization, accessible through a single point of entry. “That’s the power of centralization.” This system also includes new tools such as AI tools in LLM, where they have a working group in place to find the best way to employ them. “We are facing a big discovery and, later on, we will centralize it through a central IT service. And that’s how we do it with all technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as the subjects they research at CERN are evolving, so is their IT governance framework. This has been keeping up with industry developments, Bell explains, hand in hand with audits that allow it to operate according to best practice. “The governance part is becoming more formal. In general, everything was well organized; it was just a matter of standardizing it and developing policy frameworks around it.” Despite the establishment of these standards, the result is the opposite of rigid, explains Bell, who exemplifies this with the case of a recent cybersecurity audit in which CERN was assessed against one of the international standards, which served to improve the level of maturity. “We are adopting a fairly flexible IT governance policy, learning from the experience of others in adopting industry standards.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>South Korean firm hit with US investor lawsuit over data breach disclosure failures</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4111091/south-korean-firm-hit-with-us-investor-lawsuit-over-data-breach-disclosure-failures.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A US federal securities class action lawsuit has alleged that South Korean ecommerce giant Coupang took nearly a month to disclose a massive data breach to regulators, violating SEC rules that require companies to report material cybersecurity incidents within four business days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/61918598/Barry_v_Coupang,_Inc_et_al"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, filed December 18, came just two days after Coupang finally submitted a Form 8-K disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission — 28 days after discovering the breach on November 18.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The complaint alleges that CEO Bom Kim and CFO Gaurav Anand knew or recklessly disregarded that the company had “inadequate cybersecurity protocols” allowing a former employee to access customer data for nearly six months without detection. The breach exposed personal information from 33.7 million customer accounts, Coupang said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="disclosure-deadline-missed"&gt;Disclosure deadline missed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SEC adopted cybersecurity disclosure rules in July 2023, requiring companies to disclose material incidents within four business days of determining materiality, under item 1.05 of Form 8-K. Companies can delay disclosure only if the US Attorney General determines it poses substantial national security or public safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ksfcounsel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coupang-Complaint-rd.pdf"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt; alleges that Coupang did not receive such an exemption. The company should have filed by November 24, following its November 18 discovery of the breach, but waited until December 16.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between discovery and disclosure, media reports prompted organizational upheaval. Park Dae-jun, CEO of Coupang’s South Korean operations, &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/companies/20251210/coupang-ceo-resigns-over-data-breach"&gt;resigned December 10&lt;/a&gt; after stating he would “take full responsibility for both the incident and the handling of the case.” Harold Rogers, Coupang’s general counsel and chief administrative officer, assumed the role of interim CEO of the Korean subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coupang founder and CEO Bom Kim declined to appear at &lt;a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10640779"&gt;a South Korean parliamentary hearing&lt;/a&gt; about the breach, citing business obligations — a decision lawmakers condemned as a “systematic evasion of corporate responsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="authentication-keys-left-unrevoked-after-employee-departure"&gt;Authentication keys left unrevoked after employee departure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Investigators traced the breach to a former employee who retained valid authentication credentials after leaving the company in 2024, according to &lt;a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/ex-chinese-worker-key-to-koreas-worst-data-breach-in-decade"&gt;statements by South Korean lawmaker Choi Min-hee&lt;/a&gt;. The individual, a 43-year-old Chinese national, had worked on authentication management systems and joined Coupang in November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rep. Choi Min-hee, chair of the National Assembly’s Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101486/coupang-leaks-personal-information-of-33-7-million-accounts-suspected-of-poor-authentication-key-management.html"&gt;released analysis results in a November 30 press release&lt;/a&gt; pointing to failures in basic security procedures. The company failed to renew or revoke signing keys — the cryptographic credentials used to issue access tokens—when the employee left.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Abandoning a long-term valid authentication key was not simply a deviation by an internal employee, but the result of organizational and structural problems at Coupang that neglected the authentication system,” Choi said in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coupang’s own information to lawmakers indicated the company set token signing key validity periods of five to ten years, with rotation periods varying by key type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="legal-test-case-for-sec-cybersecurity-rules"&gt;Legal test case for SEC cybersecurity rules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Legal observers noted the Coupang lawsuit appears to be among the first securities class actions directly challenging compliance with the SEC’s 2023 cybersecurity disclosure guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a specific reason why I find the new Coupang lawsuit particularly interesting, and that is because one of the suit’s major allegations is that the company allegedly failed to make the requisite disclosures under the SEC’s cybersecurity disclosure guidelines,” legal journal, The D&amp;amp;O Diary, wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.dandodiary.com/2025/12/articles/securities-litigation/two-tech-companies-hit-with-data-breach-related-securities-suits/"&gt;analysis of the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The complaint also alleges Coupang made materially false statements in quarterly reports filed in August and November 2025. Those reports incorporated risk disclosures from the company’s 2024 Annual Report detailing encryption technology and security measures — statements the complaint said “materially understated Coupang’s risk of a material cybersecurity event.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Coupang &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001794669/000119312525325098/d77776d8k.htm"&gt;finally filed its Form 8-K&lt;/a&gt;, the company stated it had activated incident response procedures, blocked unauthorized access, and reported the incident to Korean authorities. The filing acknowledged Korean regulators “will potentially impose financial penalties” but said the company could not reasonably estimate losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="regulatory-scrutiny-in-south-korea"&gt;Regulatory scrutiny in South Korea&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In South Korea, Coupang faces potential fines up to 1.2 trillion won ($814 million) under the Personal Information Protection Act, which requires companies to notify regulators within 24 hours of discovering a breach and maintain appropriate safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Korean police raided Coupang’s Seoul headquarters twice as part of their investigation. &lt;a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2025/12/419_389929.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;President Lee Jae Myung called for expanded class action lawsuit provisions&lt;/a&gt;, saying “every Korean has been affected” by the breach affecting nearly two-thirds of the country’s 51.7 million population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks to establish a class of investors who purchased Coupang securities between August 6 and December 16. Multiple law firms have announced they are investigating similar claims. A case management conference is scheduled for March 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

Over 80 delegations, including EU Member States, EU agencies, third party countries, international organisations, and private parties attended the event. During this high-level conference, over 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen cooperation along migrant smuggling routes and tackle the growing digital dimension of these criminal activities. The declaration underscores new preventive measures, including a crackdown on online advertisements promoting migrant smuggling and the disruption of underground banking systems fuelling the criminal business.</description>

      <title>7 SASE certifications to validate converged network and security skills</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4108280/7-sase-certifications-to-validate-converged-network-and-security-skills-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated and AI-powered threats escalate, enterprises are under pressure to evolve beyond traditional perimeter-based network security. Many are turning to Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), a cloud-native framework that converges network and security functions to protect distributed workforces, optimize network performance, and simplify management across multiple tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SASE platforms typically include SD-WAN, secure web gateway (SWG), firewall as a service (FWaaS), &lt;a href="mailto:https://www.csoonline.com/article/557365/what-is-a-cloud-access-security-broker-and-why-do-i-need-one.html"&gt;cloud access security broker&lt;/a&gt; (CASB), and &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/971137/who-is-selling-zero-trust-network-access-ztna-and-what-do-you-get.html"&gt;zero-trust network access&lt;/a&gt; (ZTNA). They can also encompass a growing list of additional features such as browser isolation, sandboxing and data loss prevention (DLP). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overall SASE market is projected to climb from $15 billion in 2025 to $28.5 billion by 2028, &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6152891"&gt;according to Gartner&lt;/a&gt;. Deployments are split between single-vendor SASE platforms and dual-vendor approaches, the research firm says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With more enterprises adopting SASE architectures and a widening talent gap for security skills, IT professionals who can architect, deploy, and manage these converged platforms are in demand. SASE vendors are responding with certification programs aimed at validating these skills. A growing list of providers – including Cato Networks, Fortinet, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks and Zscaler – now offer credentials that help practitioners prove expertise in their platforms while keeping pace with the shift to cloud-delivered security. Here’s a snapshot of what they’re offering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cato Networks: &lt;a href="https://www.catonetworks.com/sase/sase-certification/sase-expert-level-1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cato SASE Expert Level 1 Certification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
