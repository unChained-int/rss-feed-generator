      <title>5 key ways attack surface management will evolve in 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090333/5-key-ways-attack-surface-management-will-evolve-in-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberattack surfaces in the enterprise have been expanding in both extent and complexity for several years and this sprawl is showing no signs of slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend can be attributed to several factors, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rise of IoT, which has added significantly more devices to networks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The increasing use of APIs and interconnected microservices&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The shift to remote work, which requires incorporating devices and connections from the home&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The seemingly uncontrollable inflation of shadow IT&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The move to decentralized infrastructure management and cloud services, which has made the entire IT ecosystem more complicated and opaque&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CSA, &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/the-state-of-cloud-and-ai-security-2025" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;82% of enterprises now use hybrid environments&lt;/a&gt;. Close to two-thirds work with two or more cloud providers, further complicating the attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mainstream adoption of AI has only made things worse. AI assistants and agents add opportunities for cybercriminals, who also use their own AI tools to scale up the volume of attacks. More than half of the organizations surveyed by the CSA use AI and about a third of them have already suffered an AI-related breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rapid development of attack surfaces and seemingly endless rise in cyber incidents – with 73% of businesses experiencing a cyber incident and 55% in the past year, according to &lt;a href="https://clutch.co/resources/cybersecurity-trends-2025" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Clutch survey&lt;/a&gt; – demands an entirely new approach to attack surface management (ASM). It’s no longer enough just to make small adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2026, I predict a shift in ASM to emphasize:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized cloud management, with secure access service edge (SASE) solutions dominating the field&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Proactive risk management takes over from reactive measures&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zero trust is becoming a non-negotiable table stake&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Intelligent, agentic AI tools are becoming crucial for attack surface protection&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sharp focus on third-party and supply chain risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Cloud management will be centralized&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one would claim that cloud assets have gone completely unmanaged up until now, but that management has been disparate and diffused. As more and more sensitive data and operations move to the cloud, the stakes are rising. Cloud protection has never been more crucial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the rise in remote and hybrid work, with employees bringing their own devices (BYOD) and logging onto cloud systems through unsecured or poorly secured networks, requires stronger cloud defenses. This calls for the adoption of approaches like SD-WAN networking, firewall-as-a-service, secure web gateways, cloud access security brokers for visibility and control over cloud data and powerful data loss protection plans, alongside traditional protections like identity and access management, zero trust and enterprise policy enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With so many moving parts, we predict a steep rise in the adoption of solutions that incorporate these multifaceted defenses. Today’s advanced SASE technologies seamlessly unify all the above methods to reduce complexity and improve agility by centralizing it all into one view, which will drive SASE to dominance in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Proactive will be the name of the game&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we enter 2026, cyberthreats have become too numerous, too serious and too rapid for reactive measures to have any hope of success. There’s simply no way to close every loophole and harden the entire attack surface. New vulnerabilities are constantly evolving, especially given the ever-elongating supply chains. Only proactive measures will do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proactive ASM measures that we predict for 2026 include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous, adaptive, automated asset inventory.&lt;/strong&gt; Organizations will deploy solutions that ceaselessly scan the ecosystem for new assets and map their extent and weaknesses, both internal and external facing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executives who understand the situation. &lt;/strong&gt;There will be a preference for leaders who understand the need to monitor and assess all parts of the attack surface, including AI tools.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated, real-time threat intelligence.&lt;/strong&gt; Real-time threat intel will be incorporated into all attack surface management workflows, ensuring that decision-making stays one step ahead of malicious actors instead of one step behind.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatically and instantly ranking threats. &lt;/strong&gt;Vulnerability management approaches will prioritize risks according to their exploitability, criticality and impact on business operations, so that the most serious ones are addressed first and don’t go overlooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. Zero trust will take on a new meaning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phishing doesn’t stop evolving. 2025 has already brought us more clever phishing, vishing (video-phishing), QR-phishing and many other types of social engineering attacks. Human error continues to be the biggest cyber risk and methodologies to trigger it are becoming ever more ingenious. With QR-phishing attacks, for example, &lt;a href="https://kymatio.com/blog/phishing-trends-ai-phishing-qrishing-and-voice-attacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;63% of cases involve an employee with access to sensitive data initiating the input vector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Massive improvements in AI-powered deepfake content mean that even audio and video calls can’t be trusted anymore. For example, employees at one company were duped by a call purportedly from the CEO authorizing a large payment. They recognized his voice, but it was all AI-generated. A 2025 study at Cardiff University found that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-800X/5/1/6" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deepfake speech can fool voice recognition systems with 95% to 97% accuracy&lt;/a&gt; and humans can only differentiate between fake and real speech for known voices 17.5% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to block these types of attacks; the only real defense is consistent and repeated employee training. We expect to see adoptions spike for phishing simulations that are designed to drive real behavior change and be delivered in the line of work. Context becomes a vital clue to authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, enterprises will also set up and strictly enforce access controls, zero trust for all people and devices and multifactor authentication by default. Internal code words and two-person verification for payments over a certain amount will become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. AI will become a crucial player&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a long time, debate has been raging about the wisdom (or otherwise) of integrating AI into cybersecurity solutions. However, events have made it clear that while AI is part of the problem for ASM, it’s also a crucial part of the solution. By 2026, AI for attack surface management will be a given.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This goes beyond using AI to automate scans and trigger alerts about suspicious emails or potential phishing scans. It will include intelligent and agentic AI that spots threats and remediates them autonomously and far faster than humans could.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, multiple specialist AI agents could work collaboratively to identify a threat, analyze the level of risk it poses and fix relevant vulnerabilities in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, numerous AI agents might monitor user behavior, share threat intelligence and dynamically recognize and respond to emerging threats, addressing unknown unknowns to keep one step ahead of malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. Risk management will look beyond business borders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third-party and supply chain risks aren’t new concerns, but in 2026, they’ll be center stage. Today’s companies rely on a long digital supply tail of apps, shortcodes, APIs and software that deliver vital digital services. These supply chains can be opaque, comprising unseen nth parties that power chatbots, delivery trackers, payment gateways, database retrieval and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It only takes one compromised dependency or overlooked vulnerability to give attackers access to the supply chain and allow them to move laterally to the target organization. It’s especially concerning because many digital partners are smaller businesses that lack the resources to use data masking techniques to defend themselves and their users’ data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why 2026 will see a rise in wider attack surface mapping that looks beyond the business itself to cover the entire supply chain. Risk assessment solutions that include third, fourth and nth-party risk will overtake their rivals and organizations will give preference to dynamic third-party evaluation solutions that are constantly updated to reflect the changing threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2026 will be a critical year for ASM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As attack surfaces grow and attacks themselves become faster and smarter, attack surface management will have to outsmart and out-think the attackers. 2026 will be the year that ASM breaks out of its rigid shell to become agile, proactive, intelligent and far-seeing, fueled by new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So verändert KI Ihre GRC-Strategie</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030328/so-verandert-ki-ihre-grc-strategie.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Establish an AI GRC Framework" class="wp-image-3986953" height="559" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ai-grc-framework-shutterstock_2628050711.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Rob Schultz / Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Da Unternehmen Cybersicherheit in ihre GRC (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492710/governance-risk-compliance-grc-adaptiver-ansatz-fur-das-risk-management.html" target="_blank"&gt;Governance, Risk &amp;amp; Compliance&lt;/a&gt;)-Prozesse integrieren, müssen bestehende Programme überarbeitet werden. Nur so lässt sich sicherstellen, dass der zunehmende Einsatz und die Risiken von Generative und Agentic AI Berücksichtigung finden – und Unternehmen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494661/9-dinge-die-cisos-den-job-kosten.html" target="_blank"&gt;compliant bleiben&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Risiken, die mit KI einhergehen, sind schwierig zu quantifizieren. Aktuelle Daten liefern jedoch Anhaltspunkte. So geht aus dem “&lt;a href="http://engage.checkpoint.com/2025-ai-security-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI Security Report 2025&lt;/a&gt;” (Download gegen Daten) des Sicherheitsanbieters Check Point hervor, dass jede 80. Anfrage, die von Unternehmensgeräten an GenAI-Dienste gesendet wurde, ein hohes Risiko für den Verlust sensibler Daten aufweist. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs stehen dabei vor der speziellen Herausforderung, mit den Innovationsanforderungen des Unternehmens Schritt zu halten und gleichzeitig den KI-Einsatz unter Berücksichtigung &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494359/der-grose-ki-risiko-guide.html" target="_blank"&gt;der Risiken&lt;/a&gt; abzusichern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-trifft-grc"&gt;KI trifft GRC&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Governance, Risk &amp;amp; Compliance ist ein Konzept, das Anfang der 2000er Jahre von der &lt;a href="https://www.oceg.org/ideas/what-is-grc/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Open Compliance and Ethics Group (OCEG)&lt;/a&gt; entwickelt wurde, um eine Reihe kritischer Fähigkeiten zu definieren. Seitdem hat sich GRC von Regeln und Checklisten mit Schwerpunkt auf Compliance zu einem umfassenderen Ansatz für das Risikomanagement entwickelt. Datenschutzanforderungen, die zunehmende Regulierung, die Bemühungen um digitale Transformation und die Fokussierung auf die Führungsebene haben diesen Wandel vorangetrieben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gleichzeitig ist Cybersicherheit zu einem zentralen Unternehmensrisiko geworden. Angesichts der zunehmenden Verbreitung von KI, gilt es nun, auch diese neue Risikokategorie in GRC-Frameworks zu integrieren. Branchenumfragen deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass es bis dahin noch ein weiter Weg ist: Laut Lenovos “&lt;a href="https://investor.lenovo.com/en/ai/ai_investments_reports.php" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CIO Playbook 2025&lt;/a&gt;” (Download gegen Daten) haben bislang nur 24 Prozent der Unternehmen umfassende Richtlinien für KI-GRC eingeführt – obwohl KI-Governance und Compliance bei den Befragten oberste Priorität genießen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um eine risikobewusste Einführung von KI zu unterstützen, rät Rich Marcus, CISO bei AuditBoard, seinen Berufskollegen, eine möglichst breite Akzeptanz für das Risikomanagement im gesamten Unternehmen zu fördern: “Um KI-Risiken erfolgreich zu managen, ist es wirklich wichtig, eine kooperative Einstellung an den Tag zu legen und den Mitarbeitern zu vermitteln, dass alle an einem Strang ziehen müssen”. Dieser Ansatz könne dazu beitragen, Transparenz darüber zu schaffen, wie und wo KI im Unternehmen eingesetzt wird.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jamie Norton, CISO der australischen Börsenaufsicht ASIC, merkt jedoch an: “Jedes einzelne Produkt, das Sie heutzutage einsetzen, enthält irgendeine Form von KI. Und es gibt kein Governance-Forum, das alle verschiedenen Formen erfasst”. Norton empfiehlt CISOs deshalb, strategische und taktische Ansätze zu entwickeln, um:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;die verschiedenen Arten von KI-Tools zu definieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;deren relative Risiken zu erfassen, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;ihren potenziellen Nutzen in Bezug auf Produktivität und Innovation abzuwägen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um mit kleineren KI-Tools umzugehen, sind laut Norton taktische Maßnahmen wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493061/positiv-denken-fur-sicherheitsentscheider-6-mindsets-die-sie-sofort-ablegen-sollten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Secure-by-Design&lt;/a&gt;-Ansätze, Initiativen, um &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494462/schatten-ki-gefahrdet-unternehmensdaten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Schatten-KI&lt;/a&gt; zu erkennen oder risikobasierte KI-Bestandsaufnahmen und -Klassifizierungen praktische Möglichkeiten. CISOs könnten dann ihre Ressourcen auf die Risiken mit dem größten Impact konzentrieren, ohne schwerfällige oder unpraktikable Prozesse zu schaffen, wie Norton erklärt. “Die Idee ist nicht, alles so zu verzögern, dass fast nichts mehr geht. Es handelt sich also eher um einen relativ schlanken Prozess, bei dem die Risikoüberlegungen entweder zur Freigabe der KI führen oder zum Gegenteil”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztendlich sei es Aufgabe der Sicherheitsverantwortlichen, KI unter Verwendung von Governance und Risiko als Teil des umfassenderen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3552765/6-risk-assessment-frameworks-im-vergleich.html" target="_blank"&gt;GRC-Frameworks&lt;/a&gt; aus Sicherheitsperspektive zu betrachten. “Heutzutage geht es nicht mehr darum, dass CISOs ‚Ja‘ oder ‚Nein‘ sagen. Es geht vielmehr darum, die Risiken bestimmter Maßnahmen transparent zu machen und dann dem Unternehmen und der Geschäftsleitung die Entscheidung über diese Risiken zu überlassen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="frameworks-fur-ki-erweitern"&gt;Frameworks für KI erweitern&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;KI-bezogene Risiken sollten als eigene Kategorie im Risikoportfolio des Unternehmens definiert und in die GRC-Säulen integriert werden, schlägt Dan Karpati, VP of AI Technologies bei Check Point, vor. Sein Konzept sieht vier solcher Säulen vor:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise Risk Management&lt;/strong&gt; definiert die Risikobereitschaft im Bereich KI und richtet einen KI-Governance-Kommittee ein.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Risk Management&lt;/strong&gt; überwacht Modellabweichungen, Verzerrungen und Adversarial Testing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Risk Management&lt;/strong&gt; umfasst Notfallpläne für KI-Ausfälle und Schulungen für menschliche Aufsichtspersonen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT Risk Management&lt;/strong&gt; umfasst regelmäßige Audits, Compliance-Prüfungen für KI-Systeme, Governance-Rahmenwerke und die Ausrichtung auf die Geschäftsziele.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um diese Risiken abzubilden, können CISOs beispielsweise das &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST AI Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt; (oder andere Rahmenwerke wie &lt;a href="https://www.coso.org/guidance-on-ic" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;COSO&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2824150/was-ist-cobit.html" target="_blank"&gt;COBIT&lt;/a&gt;) heranziehen und deren Kernprinzipien auf KI anwenden. Etwa, wenn es um probabilistische Ergebnisse, Datenabhängigkeit, undurchsichtige Entscheidungsfindungen, Autonomie und schnelle Weiterentwicklung geht. Der relativ junge Benchmark &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO/IEC 42001&lt;/a&gt; bietet zudem einen strukturierten Rahmen für KI-Monitoring und -Kontrolle, der Governance- und Risikopraktiken über den gesamten KI-Lebenszyklus hinweg verankern soll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Frameworks anzupassen, bietet eine Möglichkeit, die Diskussion über KI-Risiken zu verbessern, die Risikobereitschaft im Bereich KI an die übergeordnete Risikotoleranz des Unternehmens anzupassen und eine robuste KI-Governance in allen Geschäftsbereichen zu verankern. “Anstatt das Rad neu zu erfinden, können Sicherheitsverantwortliche KI-Risiken so konkreten geschäftlichen Auswirkungen zuordnen”, meint Karpati.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;KI-Risiken lassen sich darüber hinaus auch anderen potenziellen Risiken zuordnen. Etwa dem Potenzial für: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;finanzielle Verluste durch Betrug oder fehlerhafte Entscheidungen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reputationsschäden durch Datenschutzverletzungen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Bias-behaftete Ergebnisse und damit zusammenhängender Kundenunzufriedenheit,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Betriebsstörungen durch schlechte Integration mit Legacy-Systemen, oder&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;rechtliche und regulatorische Strafen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines KI-bezogenen Ereignisses zu bewerten, den finanziellen Verlust einzuschätzen und Risikokennzahlen zu ermitteln, können CISOs auf Frameworks wie &lt;a href="https://www.fairinstitute.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; zurückgreifen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AuditBoard-CISO Marcus empfiehlt Sicherheitsentscheidern zudem, Branchennetzwerke zu nutzen und sich auch mit Kollegen anderer Unternehmen auszutauschen: “Es ist hilfreich zu wissen, welche Risiken sich in der Praxis zeigen und was andere Unternehmen geschützt hätte. Nur so lassen sich gemeinsam wichtige Kontrollen und Verfahren entwickeln, die die Branche in ihrer Gesamtheit widerstandsfähiger macht.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="neue-governance-richtlinien-entwickeln"&gt;Neue Governance-Richtlinien entwickeln&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs müssen jedoch nicht nur Risiken definieren und die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495375/third-party-risk-management-so-vermeiden-sie-compliance-unheil.html" target="_blank"&gt;Compliance managen&lt;/a&gt;, sondern auch neue Governance-Richtlinien entwickeln, wie Marcus unterstreicht: “Eine effektive Governance braucht Richtlinien für die akzeptable Nutzung von KI. Eines der ersten Ergebnisse eines Bewertungsprozesses sollte sein, Verhaltensregeln für Ihr Unternehmen festzulegen”. Um KI-Tools für die interne Verwendung zu klassifizieren, schlägt der Sicherheitsentscheider ein Ampelsystem vor. Dabei:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sind “grüne” Tools geprüft und genehmigt,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;erfordern “gelbe” Tools eine zusätzliche Bewertung,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;verfügen “rote” Tools nicht über die erforderlichen Schutzmaßnahmen und sind damit untersagt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Marcus empfiehlt CISOs und ihren Teams zudem, im Voraus Leitprinzipien festzulegen, das Unternehmen über die wichtigen Aspekte aufzuklären und die Teams bei der Selbstkontrolle zu unterstützen, indem sie Dinge herausfiltern, die nicht dem Standard entsprechen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ASIC-CISO Norton warnt, dass die Sicherheitsteams nun, da die glänzende Oberfläche der KI für jedermann zugänglich sei, ihren Fokus auf das richten müssten, was darunter vor sich geht. “Als CISOs wollen wir Innovationen nicht behindern, aber wir müssen Leitplanken setzen, damit wir nicht ins Leere laufen und unsere Daten verlorengehen”, meint der Manager.

      <title>Rethinking identity for the AI era: CISOs must build trust at machine speed</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089732/rethinking-identity-for-the-ai-era-cisos-must-build-trust-at-machine-speed.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs have a burgeoning identity crisis on their hands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/"&gt;Verizon’s 2025 Data Breach Investigation Report&lt;/a&gt;, cyber attackers have &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970094/cybercriminals-switch-up-their-top-initial-access-vectors-of-choice.html"&gt;switched up their initial access vectors of choice&lt;/a&gt;, with stolen credentials a leading cause of data breaches, triggering 22% of all intrusions and 88% of basic web application attacks. These findings followed Varonis researchers’ conclusion that 57% of cyberattacks in 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/the-identity-crisis-research-report"&gt;started with compromised identities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No matter the source of research, it is undeniable that many, if not most, significant cyber intrusions increasingly begin with an identity failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These failures will likely get worse and more frequent — and at machine speed — &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4047974/agentic-ai-a-cisos-security-nightmare-in-the-making.html"&gt;as use of agentic AI&lt;/a&gt; rises. This radical technology shift, in which AI agents increasingly act autonomously, impersonate humans, and make decisions faster than existing governance processes and practices can accommodate, will force cybersecurity leaders to overhaul how they monitor and manage identity systems in their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or as &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jalkove/"&gt;Jim Alkove&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Oleria and head of the &lt;a href="https://www.security-innovation.org/"&gt;SINET Identity Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, recently &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jim_55397/the-ai-revolution-its-here-it-s-big-and-identity-will-unleash-its-full-power-35605b70d7b1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “Our current frameworks, protocols, and operational processes for identity and access were never intended to handle the speed, scale, and complexity of AI.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say that CISOs must quickly revamp their approach to managing identity by going beyond login or access authorization, instead placing identity management at the core of their enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-collapse-of-traditional-identity-models"&gt;The collapse of traditional identity models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current identity and access models were built to grant access and authorization levels to human beings and not autonomous software, such as the proliferating number of AI agents. Experts say the human-centric identity models that hand out usernames, roles, and access levels will likely collapse when faced with thousands of autonomous agents making requests every second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are inviting something that simulates human behavior into our environment, and no one is thinking about how to authenticate and authorize this new individual,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricsmith/"&gt;Ric Smith&lt;/a&gt;, president of products and technology at Okta, tells CSO. “The analogous thing would be you just take a random person off the street, walk them into your building, and let them loose, because technically that’s what people are doing as a result of developing LLMs or developing on LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse, incorporating AI agents into existing identity models only adds a layer of complexity to identity environments that have already proved problematic, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenstone618/"&gt;Steve Stone&lt;/a&gt;, SVP of threat discovery and response at SentinelOne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The direction AI is taking is going to accelerate the already existing identity challenge,” Stone tells CSO. “So we’re going to take a problem that’s currently fairly difficult and widespread and we’re just going to really throw gas on that fire when it comes to AI.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem are the typical interaction layers involved with AI, according to Stone. “There’s a real machine identity problem because you’re interacting with AI and those technologies often through APIs and other mechanisms,” he says. “That identity piece is not just how you log into the machine; it is also how your machines are communicating with the machines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but few organizations are equipped to deal with how quickly identity challenges will emerge. “We talk about intrusions now, and it used to be months into weeks and then it was weeks into days, and now &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3825444/ransomware-gangs-extort-victims-17-hours-after-intrusion-on-average.html"&gt;we’re really into hours&lt;/a&gt;,” Stone says. “When we talk about AI agents, we’re going to have to make decisions that impact companies in seconds. There is not going to be time to go through the incident response playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Suddenly, we have these tools now that can aggregate tens and hundreds of thousands of components of information,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peclay/"&gt;Pete Clay&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of aerospace company Aireon and former CISO of Deloitte, tells CSO. “Identity was really designed just to make sure that you could see the Word document that I sent you. It was never designed to work at the speed and with the velocity that we’re asking identity to work with in the AI era.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identity-as-a-trust-fabric"&gt;Identity as a trust fabric&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most organizations currently rely on a welter of identity and access management systems for a variety of reasons. Some systems might be tied to a specific vendor’s technology; some might be legacy systems from mergers or acquisitions; some might be in place due to legal or regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens even before we get to the agentic AI era is that identity today is actually in silos,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-gajjala-3b073530/"&gt;Vijay Gajjala&lt;/a&gt;, VP of product at identity security platform Oleria, tells CSO. “You have people who are still using on-prem identity, Active Directory, whatever. You also have people using cloud identity like Entra, Google Identity, and Okta. There isn’t a single way to answer the question of who has access to what. This is itself a fundamental problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why the SINET Identity Working Group — which includes a host of internet infrastructure and security pioneers, including Heather Adkins, VP of security engineering at Google; Jason Lee, former CISO of Zoom and Splunk; Michael Montoya, CTO at F5; and many others — lays out a vision for what it calls an AI Trust Fabric, an “autonomous, self-healing system [that] depends entirely on trust.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This fabric consists of robust identity and protocols, where every entity has a unique and proofed identity. The protocols that are part of this fabric “must cryptographically prove both the ownership of a token and the origin of the identity in a sound, verifiable manner.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group’s vision involves dynamic access and authorization that does away with static bearer tokens that often prove to be a liability. At the same time, the group suggests that authorizations should be finely grained and configurable via APIs for least-privileged agent access to tools, systems, and data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, access should be configurable on the fly and should not be a simple yes or no, but instead should reflect a dynamic composition based on all relevant entities in the chain. Finally, the fabric should make delegations of access explicit when an AI agent acts on behalf of a human or another AI agent and be built on specific revocation and just-in-time access policies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In essence, “We don’t want to give agents agency” when it comes to identity, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carey-frey-1645943/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Carey Frey&lt;/a&gt;, VP and CSO of TELUS and a SINET working group member, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We think of a human having access to something maybe for days, months, or years,” he adds. “But these agents could literally come and go in seconds or hours, and then they might spawn sub-agents and be in a whole network of other agents all around the world, and they could go off and start doing things which humans may never be able to catch up with.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="better-identity-management-to-address-ais-known-risks"&gt;Better identity management to address AI’s known risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An identity trust fabric could go a long way to preventing AI’s known risks. According to the SINET group, better identity management could be a proactive risk mitigation against several emerging AI threats, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI/CD pipeline vulnerabilities,&lt;/strong&gt; which consist of malicious code injected in LLMs that could poison an AI from inception&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt injection,&lt;/strong&gt; where attackers craft subtle, malicious inputs to manipulate an AI agent’s behavior&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI takeover/manipulation, &lt;/strong&gt;which gives a threat actor control over an AI model’s output or decision-making&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data poisoning,&lt;/strong&gt; where attackers deliberately inject corrupted or misleading data into an AI model’s training dataset&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model and training data disclosure, &lt;/strong&gt;which is when attackers use carefully crafted prompts to trick AI agents into revealing sensitive information such as proprietary code, confidential business data, or personal information that the model was never meant to share&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model extraction or IP theft, &lt;/strong&gt;where attackers continuously query APIs to reconstruct model behavior, stealing IP or disclosing proprietary, sensitive training data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of all these threats, experts point to prompt injection as the most likely risk. “We do have the prompt injection problem,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elykahn/"&gt;Ely Kahn&lt;/a&gt;, chief product officer at SentinelOne, tells CSO. “It’s extremely easy for an adversary to find some exposed web asset or resource, put a malicious prompt in it, and then wait for an AI system to read that malicious prompt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Then that AI system is tricked into starting to expose sensitive data,” he adds. “And I think we’re on the precipice of where we’re going to start seeing AI security-related attacks like prompt injections every week in the news headlines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-cisos-should-prepare-for-the-new-identity-era"&gt;How CISOs should prepare for the new identity era&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The need for CISOs to implement improved identity systems or build something akin to an identity fabric will arrive quickly, although experts say it’s critical to have fundamental cybersecurity hygiene measures in place before even thinking about tackling a more comprehensive identity program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The analogy I use is if you don’t have good hygiene, then anything new that you do would be bad,” Oleria’s Gajjala says. “If you don’t have good body hygiene and all of a sudden you bought a thousand-dollar suit, that doesn’t change the fact that you have bad hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the security basics are in place, preparing for the coming AI identity challenges should be a deliberate process that is not to be rushed. “You literally have to start from ground zero and think about how I am granting access to the data that I care about and how I measure that, and then how do I automate that in a way that I stay on top of this problem all the time,” Aireon’s Clay says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As is always the case when introducing new security programs into the organization, CISOs should work with decision-makers to pave the way for changes. “What we want CISOs to do is to work with their enterprises to say, we really need to have these solutions and put in place those security standards and models for identity and authentication before adopting new solutions,” says Frey, of TELUS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like any other major security effort, “it always starts in the most boring and horrible place ever, which is governance,” Clay says. “You have to really start to understand what I am trying to protect and how I am trying to protect it before you start building tools and processes and everything else. Then that governance process is: A user can do this, this administrator can do that, this person can do this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cyberschutz Energiesektor" class="wp-image-4092022" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2653835251.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Energieversorger müssen ihre Systeme vor immer raffinierteren Cyberangriffen schützen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;vectorfusionart – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Energieversorgung ist das Rückgrat moderner Gesellschaften. Stromnetze, Gaspipelines und digitale Steuerungssysteme bilden die Grundlage für Industrie, Transport und öffentliche Dienstleistungen. Doch mit der zunehmenden Digitalisierung wächst auch die Angriffsfläche. In den vergangenen Jahren ist der Energiesektor verstärkt ins Visier von Cyberkriminellen und staatlich unterstützten Angreifern geraten. Studien europäischer und internationaler Einrichtungen zeigen: Nur eine Kombination aus Technologie, Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) und internationaler Zusammenarbeit kann langfristig für Resilienz sorgen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hohe-bedrohungslage-im-energiesektor"&gt;Hohe Bedrohungslage im Energiesektor&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der &lt;a href="https://www.e-isac.info/content/files/2024/07/ENISA_Bimonthly_Energy_-May_Jun_2024.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ENISA Situational Awareness Report&lt;/a&gt; stuft die Bedrohungslage für den europäischen Energiesektor als hoch ein. Energieunternehmen stehen zunehmend im Fokus außereuropäischer Hackergruppen, die gezielt OT-Systeme (Operational Technology) attackieren – etwa durch DDoS-Kampagnen, Manipulation von Mensch-Maschine-Schnittstellen oder Passwort-Resets in Leitstellen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch kritische Schwachstellen in Grid-Sensoren, wie sie etwa bei Siemens-Produkten entdeckt wurden (CVSS-Score 8.6), verdeutlichen die Anfälligkeit der Netzinfrastruktur. Angriffe können sofort Kaskadeneffekte auslösen, von Stromausfällen bis hin zu massiven Störungen in Transport und Gesundheitsversorgung.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internationale Beispiele unterstreichen die Dringlichkeit. In der Ukraine kam es 2015 und 2016 zu gezielten Angriffen auf Umspannwerke, die Teile des Stromnetzes lahmlegten. Auch in den USA wurde die Verwundbarkeit deutlich: Der Ransomware-Angriff auf die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494135/ransomware-cyberattacke-auf-colonial-pipeline-das-ist-die-bilanz-nach-einem-jahr.html" target="_blank"&gt;Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; im Jahr 2021 führte zu erheblichen Versorgungsengpässen bei Treibstoff und löste eine landesweite Diskussion über die Sicherheit &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/de/critical-infrastructure/page/2/" target="_blank"&gt;kritischer Infrastrukturen&lt;/a&gt; aus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zudem meldeten mehrere Energieversorger in Nordamerika im Jahr 2023 koordinierte Angriffe, die über kompromittierte IoT-Geräte in Smart Grids orchestriert wurden. Diese Vorfälle zeigen, dass Energieinfrastrukturen durch ihre Systemrelevanz zu bevorzugten Zielen im geopolitischen Kontext geworden sind – mit unmittelbaren Auswirkungen auf Gesellschaft, Wirtschaft und Sicherheit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lesetipp: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493010/energiewende-in-deutschland-hacker-zielen-auf-solar-und-windkraftanlagen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Energiewende in Deutschland – Hacker zielen auf Solar- und Windkraftanlagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-stille-gefahr-it-ot-kopplung"&gt;Die stille Gefahr: IT-OT-Kopplung&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein entscheidender Treiber neuer Risiken ist die wachsende Kopplung von IT- und OT-Systemen. Smart Grids, digitale Umspannwerke und IoT-Sensoren ermöglichen zwar eine effizientere Netzsteuerung, eröffnen jedoch gleichzeitig neue Angriffsvektoren. Der &lt;a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/cyber-europe-tests-the-eu-cyber-preparedness-in-the-energy-sector"&gt;ENISA Cyber Europe-Test&lt;/a&gt; hat gezeigt, dass 32 Prozent der Betreiber im Energiesektor keinen einzigen kritischen OT-Prozess durch ein Security Operations Center (SOC) überwachen lassen. Nur etwas mehr als die Hälfte – 52 Prozent – verfügt überhaupt über ein gemeinsames SOC, das IT- und OT-Systeme integriert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch der aktuelle &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/Lageberichte/Lagebericht2024.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BSI-Lagebericht&lt;/a&gt; unterstreicht die Dringlichkeit: Zahlreiche &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3961114/ot-security-warum-der-blick-auf-open-source-lohnt.html" target="_blank"&gt;OT-Systeme&lt;/a&gt; arbeiten weiterhin mit unsicheren Protokollen wie ModbusTCP oder laufen auf veralteter Firmware. Fehlende Patches und mangelnde Updates erhöhen zusätzlich das Risiko, dass bekannte Schwachstellen gezielt ausgenutzt werden können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="von-sichtbarkeit-zu-resilienz"&gt;Von Sichtbarkeit zu Resilienz&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparenz ist die Grundvoraussetzung für Sicherheit. Weltweite Analysen zeigen, dass zehntausende OT-Geräte öffentlich im Internet erreichbar sind – oft &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3856334/zu-wenig-budget-fur-ot-security.html" target="_blank"&gt;ohne hinreichenden Schutz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forscher weisen darauf hin, dass diese Systeme häufig veraltete Softwareversionen nutzen und bekannte Schwachstellen unbehandelt bleiben. Für Energieversorger bedeutet das: Sichtbarkeit vom Rechenzentrum bis zum Edge ist unverzichtbar. Nur wer ein vollständiges Inventar seiner Systeme kennt, kontinuierlich Schwachstellen bewertet und Bedrohungsdaten integriert, kann Angriffe abwehren und die Zeit bis zur Reaktion minimieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-als-fruhwarnsystem-und-enabler"&gt;KI als Frühwarnsystem und Enabler&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die hybride Bedrohungslage verschärft sich zunehmend – auch durch den Einsatz von Künstlicher Intelligenz. Laut der &lt;a href="https://www.tuev-verband.de/studien/tuev-cybersecurity-studie-2025" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TÜV Cybersecurity Studie 2025&lt;/a&gt; vermuten mehr als die Hälfte der Unternehmen, bereits Ziel von KI-gestützten Angriffen geworden zu sein. Gleichzeitig setzen jedoch nur zehn Prozent selbst KI-Technologien zur Verteidigung ein, etwa zur Anomalie-Erkennung oder automatisierten Reaktion. Damit bleibt ein erhebliches Sicherheitsdefizit bestehen.  Besonders relevant ist die Fähigkeit von KI, Muster in riesigen Datenmengen zu erkennen, die für menschliche Analysten unsichtbar bleiben. Moderne Ansätze kombinieren klassische SOC-Überwachung mit Predictive Detection und Simulationen über Digitale Zwillinge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weitere Studien zeigen, dass KI in der Energiewirtschaft nicht nur zur Reaktion, sondern auch als Frühwarnmechanismus eingesetzt werden kann. Durch intelligente Risikoanalysen und Big-Data-gestützte Prognosen lassen sich Anomalien und sicherheitskritische Ereignisse im Stromnetz frühzeitig erkennen – ein entscheidender Schritt, um kritische Infrastrukturen resilienter gegen komplexe Angriffe und Störungen zu machen. Auch internationale Cyber-Agenturen wie CISA (USA) oder das NCSC (UK) setzen verstärkt auf KI-basierte &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3557774/was-ist-cyber-threat-intelligence.html"&gt;Threat-Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;-Systeme, die Daten aus globalen Netzwerken bündeln.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="internationale-kooperation-resilienz-braucht-allianzen"&gt;Internationale Kooperation: Resilienz braucht Allianzen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angesichts der Bedrohungslage kann kein Energieversorger isoliert bestehen. Notwendig sind internationale Kooperationen und europäische Standards. Die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090107/bundestag-beschliest-nis2-umsetzung.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS-2-Richtlinie&lt;/a&gt; verpflichtet Betreiber kritischer Infrastrukturen in Europa zu umfassendem Risikomanagement, Vorfallmeldungen und enger Zusammenarbeit mit nationalen Behörden. Parallel entstehen Initiativen wie GAIA-X, die souveräne europäische Datenräume schaffen, um den sicheren Austausch von Informationen in kritischen Branchen zu ermöglichen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine tragende Rolle spielen außerdem CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams), die Bedrohungsinformationen bündeln und koordinierte Reaktionen ermöglichen. Zunehmend setzen auch sektorübergreifende Allianzen Akzente: Kooperationen zwischen Energie-, Telekommunikations- und Transportunternehmen sollen Angriffe abwehren, die gleich mehrere Infrastrukturen betreffen. NATO und die EU arbeiten zudem verstärkt an gemeinsamen Cyberabwehrübungen, um grenzüberschreitende Resilienz zu stärken. Der Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative in den USA ist ein Beispiel für ein Modell, das auch in Europa Nachahmer finden könnte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ausblick-quantenresilienz-und-globale-standards"&gt;Ausblick: Quantenresilienz und globale Standards&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die kommenden Jahre werden entscheidend sein. Während KI heute das zentrale Werkzeug zur Abwehr ist, werden Quantencomputing und Post-Quantum-Kryptografie absehbar neue Dimensionen eröffnen. Energieversorger müssen ihre Sicherheitsarchitekturen frühzeitig auf diese Entwicklungen vorbereiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fazit-ohne-digitale-resilienz-keine-energiesicherheit"&gt;Fazit: Ohne digitale Resilienz keine Energiesicherheit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Energiesicherheit im 21. Jahrhundert bedeutet unweigerlich auch Cybersicherheit. Angriffe auf kritische Netze sind längst Realität, ihre Abwehr erfordert entschlossenes Handeln. Zentral sind dabei drei Handlungsfelder: Erstens braucht es End-to-End-Transparenz mit einer vollständigen Inventarisierung und Überwachung aller Systeme. Zweitens sind KI-gestützte Frühwarnsysteme entscheidend – von Predictive Detection bis hin zu Digital Twins. Drittens kommt es auf internationale Kooperationen an, etwa durch die konsequente Umsetzung von NIS-2, die Nutzung souveräner Datenräume und die aktive Beteiligung an CERTs. Klar ist: Resilienz entsteht nicht durch Insellösungen, sondern durch das Zusammenspiel von Technologie, KI und globaler Zusammenarbeit. Nur wer in diese Pfeiler investiert, legt das Fundament für eine stabile Energiezukunft. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strengthening the protection of confidential and sensitive data is currently a priority for 40% of chief security officers.&lt;a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And both enterprises and small and mid-sized businesses have already made significant investments in authentication, access controls and identity and access management (IAM).&lt;a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these investments are not effective without robust passwords. At the same time, password management is a cost for IT and security teams, and an inconvenience for technology users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scale of the problem should not be underestimated. The Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report says that half of data breaches, and over 80% of attacks on web applications involved compromised credentials.&lt;a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And the average employee now has to manage over 100 unique user &lt;a&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This leaves businesses facing a number of challenges around password management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These include SSO (single sign on) authentication; automation, and integration with their identity infrastructure, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and Active Directory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, IT teams have to meet compliance responsibilities, ensuring that passwords and password management complies with GDPR, security standards such as ISO27001, and the business’ backup, recovery and auditing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cutting down password overheads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mid-sized businesses and enterprises all want to reduce the cost of passwords and identity management. But they want to do this without sacrificing flexibility, the time it takes to resolve password issues, and of course, security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dedicated password management solutions can help with this. The right tools can reduce password-related support costs by as much 80&lt;a&gt;%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even greater benefits come from improved security. Organisations that have moved to their own password management infrastructure say they see a 60% decrease in password-related security incidents&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However effective a solution might be on a technical level, it will not produce the promised security or productivity benefits unless it is adopted widely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, CIOs and security teams need to consider the user experience and the user interface of the tools they are deploying. Even the best solution is ineffective if users ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploying password management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These factors are prompting more organisations to deploy their own password management tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This gives IT and security teams complete control over password management, and control of data locations, or “sovereignty”, and access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional capabilities include automated password rotation, and integration with single sign on (SSO), multi-factor authentication systems, and privileged access management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This goes far beyond the password and identity management capabilities of the majority of enterprise applications. And there are further benefits of a single, centralised approach to password and identity management, rather than relying on each software vendor’s own approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CIOs, though, will want any dedicated password management tool to integrate with those applications, including through APIs. And they will want it to support multiple locations, including international operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investment, though, will pay off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving to a dedicated password manager – locally or in the cloud – can bring considerable savings. Passwork, for example, has a total cost of ownership that is up to 30% lower than comparable, alternative tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it is not just about value for money. Investing in password management is about efficiency: reduced overheads, less time wasted on routine password management, and an improved user experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it is investing in an essential part of any comprehensive approach to compliance and security.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More work for admins as Google patches latest zero-day Chrome vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4092287/more-work-for-admins-as-google-patches-latest-zero-day-chrome-vulnerability.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the third time in recent months, Google has found itself scrambling to fix a potentially serious zero-day flaw in the Chrome browser’s V8 JavaScript engine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addressed on Monday as part of an &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_17.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;emergency ‘out-of-band’ patch&lt;/a&gt;, the vulnerability identified as &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13223" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-13223&lt;/a&gt; was discovered by Clément Lecigne of Google’s in-house Threat Analysis Group (TAG).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At some point, the company also uncovered evidence that the flaw, rated ‘high’ with a CVSS score of 8.8, was being exploited in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As is customary to avoid giving other threat groups clues, Google’s advisory offers no detail on this discovery, merely stating: “Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2025-13223 exists in the wild.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="type-confusion"&gt;Type confusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability description is just as sparse, mentioning only that the vulnerability is a Type Confusion flaw affecting the V8 JavaScript engine. This is a core element not only of Chrome, but also other Chromium-based browsers, including Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Opera.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latter point is significant given that Chromium browsers are by some distance the most widely used consumer and business browsers in the world. Not surprisingly, Google added the following boilerplate statement to its latest advisory:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third-party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of third-party apps, that could take some time. In short, don’t hold your breath if you’re expecting a more detailed explanation of CVE-2025-13223.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The V8 engine was introduced by Google in 2008 to speed up JavaScript, a C++ scripting technology fundamental to modern web technology. Type Confusion is a &lt;a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;class of vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that in this type of C-coded component can cause memory corruption, out-of-bounds access, and in the worst-case scenario, code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This raises the possibility that CVE-2025-13223 can be exploited without user interaction by luring a user to a booby-trapped website. Google’s advisory doesn’t say, while the National Vulnerability (NVD) entry says only: “Type Confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 142.0.7444.175 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.” However, given that many V8 engine vulnerabilities make this kind of exploit possible, security administrators should assume it is a risk and patch Chrome as a priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-updating"&gt;Enterprise updating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest update also addresses a separate Type Confusion vulnerability in the V8 engine, &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13224" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-13224&lt;/a&gt;, also rated as ‘high’ priority. So far, there is no indication that this is under exploit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise customers can address both flaws by updating to Chrome version 142.0.7444.175/.176 for Windows, version 142.0.7444.176 for Mac, and version 142.0.7444.175 for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally, enterprises patch every eight weeks on the Extended Stable Channel (ESC), allowing plenty of time for testing. In contrast, patches for zero-day vulnerabilities will usually be applied manually within days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For enterprise admins, the toll is real, because zero days mean a sweaty scramble to get fast patching and testing. And because Chrome updates come without real warning, hard and often, teams don’t get a break,” commented &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zbyneksopuch/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zbyněk Sopuch&lt;/a&gt;, CTO of risk management company Safetica.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The pattern here is that shared components multiply the blast radius, and until the wider community patches in an organized way, V8 stays one of the ripest targets in the room,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers are always looking for ways to target V8, he said, because it allows them to “aim at the entire beehive. Admins are lying awake at night because of Chrome and the unknown list of apps that quietly run the same engine.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chrome has suffered two other confirmed zero days in the V8 engine in 2025, from a tally of seven across Chrome as a whole. The V8 flaws were &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4001153/google-patches-third-zero-day-flaw-in-chrome-this-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-5419&lt;/a&gt; in June and &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10585" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-10585&lt;/a&gt; in September. Seven zero days sounds like a lot, but the annual count has been &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2123686/chrome-patches-fourth-zero-day-flaw-this-month.html?utm=hybrid_search" target="_blank"&gt;around this level for some time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
