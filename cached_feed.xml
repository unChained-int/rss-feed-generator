      <title>From Tabletop to Turnkey: Building Cyber Resilience in Financial Services</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/from-tabletop-to-turnkey-building-cyber.html</link>
      <description>Introduction
Financial institutions are facing a new reality: cyber-resilience has passed from being a best practice, to an operational necessity, to a prescriptive regulatory requirement.
Crisis management or Tabletop exercises, for a long time relatively rare in the context of cybersecurity, have become required as a series of regulations has introduced this requirement to FSI organizations in</description>

      <title>Global experts advance the joint fight against crypto-enabled crime</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/global-experts-advance-joint-fight-against-crypto-enabled-crime</link>
      <description>The criminal use of cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly professionalised, but so too is the global response. Participants at the 9th Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptoassets emphasised three priorities: developing common standards, deepening cooperation and investing in capacity. These are essential if authorities and industry are to keep pace with evolving threats and recover illicit cryptoassets at scale.</description>

      <title>Fake number, real damage: Europol urges action against caller ID spoofing</title>

      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <title>Crowdstrike cybersecurity report highlights a spike in physical attacks on privileged users</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4084478/crowdstrike-cybersecurity-report-highlights-a-spike-in-physical-attacks-on-privileged-users.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While tracking cyberattacks since last year, a Crowdstrike report also found that physical attacks and kidnappings have increased dramatically, particularly in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In January 2025, threat actors kidnapped and attempted to extort the co-founder of Ledger, a prolific cryptocurrency wallet vendor, in France,” &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/resources/reports/2025-european-threat-landscape-report/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Crowdstrike report&lt;/a&gt; said. “Although the threat actors in this case and numerous others have been arrested, the threat persists. Between January 2025 and September 2025, 17 similar incidents occurred in Europe, 13 of which occurred in France.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity consultants said that they have been hearing similar reports of increased &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;violence to gain system access&lt;/a&gt; for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am seeing both an increase in the use of cyberattacks as a distraction for real world thefts and attacks, and the combined use of cyber and physical means to achieve criminal objectives. It is giving a new meaning to ‘brute force’ attacks,” said cybersecurity consultant &lt;a href="https://formergov.com/directory/brianlevine" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, a directory of former government and military specialists. “As a result, both organizations and individuals are already deepening their focus on physical security and executive security. Playbooks for cyber should explicitly encourage the team to consider whether the incident they are addressing may be, in whole or in part, a distraction for some other type of attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://trustedsec.com/team-members/art-cooper" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Art Cooper&lt;/a&gt;, the principal security consultant at TrustedSec, said his key, albeit flippant, recommendation for executives who could be physically threatened by criminals trying to gain data access is, “Get a shotgun.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cooper said that part of the problem is the typically loose way in which many European and American enterprises handle physical security, compared with, for example, enterprises in India. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said Indian enterprises typically have multi-layered physical security around key buildings, with different security firms handling different layers. When someone enters, he said, they are typically asked to submit all electronic devices for inspection, where guards record all serial numbers. As the visitor moves deeper into the building, other security teams, working for other security companies, inspect those devices and capture the serial numbers again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he has started seeing enterprises in China and Japan embracing the lax methods practiced by Americans. “Asian society is starting to be just as bad as Western,” Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fvillanustre/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Flavio Villanustre&lt;/a&gt;, SVP and CISO for LexisNexis Risk Solutions: “Physical violence as a service, such as kidnapping, is taking things to a different level, where criminals don’t seem to care much about losing the veil of anonymity protection that the internet gives them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-targets"&gt;Key targets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Crowdstrike report detailed some of the global patterns for attack prevalence. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Entities in Europe are more than twice as likely to be targeted than entities in the Asia Pacific and Japan region,” the report said, adding that the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3808871/gdpr-fines-reduced-in-2024.html?utm=hybrid_search" target="_blank"&gt;European Union’s GDPR&lt;/a&gt; is one of the reasons. “Threat actors have leveraged GDPR data breach penalties to pressure victims into paying ransoms. Several threat actors have threatened to report entities for regulatory noncompliance via their &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data leak sites&lt;/a&gt;, in ransom notes, or during negotiations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report highlighted various statistical attack patterns, including the most targeted verticals (manufacturing, professional services, technology, industrials and engineering, and retail) and the most popular attack methods, including, it said, “Dumping credentials from backup and restore configuration databases, which often store credentials used to access hypervisor infrastructure; remotely encrypting files, executing ransomware, often from an unmanaged system, and running the file encryption process outside of the targeted system; leveraging access to unmanaged systems to steal data and deploy ransomware; and deploying Linux ransomware on VMware ESXi infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another increasingly popular attack vector, the report said, is creating fake CAPTCHA lures to deliver malware. “This social engineering technique involves using pages that imitate CAPTCHA authentication tests to convince victims to copy, paste, and execute malicious code into the Windows Run dialog box or terminal. Identified campaigns used phishing emails, malicious advertising (malvertising), and search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to direct targets to fake CAPTCHA pages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some criminal services have aggressively pushed specific capabilities as their own specialties, the report noted: “Advertised features included dynamically created code obfuscation, security bypass capabilities and decoy functionalities [such as] imitating cryptocurrency management platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the report found that the tradition of Russian attack groups avoiding victimizing Russian businesses and consumers is still very much in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The prohibition on targeting organizations and citizens of Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries has long been a tacit and often codified rule in the Russian-language underground ecosystem,” the report said. “Though this prohibition is likely rooted in an attempt to avoid domestic law enforcement, patriotism also likely plays a role, with CIS-based eCrime threat actors preferring to target external entities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How crooks use IT to enable cargo theft</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4084523/how-crooks-use-it-to-enable-cargo-theft.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the old days, crooks followed transport trucks and hijacked them. Today they use phishing, vishing and identity theft to find and divert valuable cargo via logistics systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a challenge for IT and infosec leaders to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest example of these tactics is a new campaign by cybercrooks using spear phishing-delivered malware to hack into the IT systems of freight companies to steal cargo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proofpoint, which discovered the campaign, warned IT and infosec leaders in the transportation sector this week &lt;a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/B--RCGwk9khOoZNyCKf9CBNczo?domain=proofpoint.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;of the new phishing campaign&lt;/a&gt;, mostly aimed at North American freight firms, that has been active since at least June but possibly was active as early as January.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The actor has delivered a range of RMM [remote monitoring and management] tools or in some cases remote access software including ScreenConnect, SimpleHelp, PDQ Connect, Fleetdeck, N-able and LogMeIn Resolve,” says the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These RMMs/RAS are often used in tandem; for example, PDQ Connect has been observed downloading and installing both ScreenConnect and SimpleHelp. Once initial access is established, the threat actor conducts system and network reconnaissance and deploys credential harvesting tools such as WebBrowserPassView. This activity indicates a broader effort to compromise accounts and deepen access within targeted environments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the crooks try to compromise a broker load board, an online marketplace where trucking firms can bid on loads. They may post an offer of a fake load, or insert themselves in the middle of an email conversation between a carrier and a firm looking for a trucker to deliver a load. When a carrier responds by email, the crooks reply with a message that includes an infected attachment that leads to the installation of the remote access malware. Then the crooks can bid on real cargo loads, which they then try to steal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to pretend to be a legitimate transport company and ask a customer to send a payment to a bank account controlled by the crook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One company &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FreightBrokers/comments/1ndwsio/how_our_company_got_hacked_and_almost_lost_8/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;described on Reddit how it was compromised&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year: A supposed broker emailed a ‘setup’ link to the carrier’s dispatcher. When it was clicked, it led to their email being compromised, after which existing bookings were deleted and dispatcher notifications were blocked. The crook added their own device to the dispatcher’s phone extension, booked loads under the compromised carrier’s name and coordinated the transport. The gang then tried and failed to steal eight truck loads of goods in California after the victim firm realized what was happening and drivers were alerted. However, several weeks later, another transportation company was hit in the same way, suggesting the gang had moved on to other firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phishing attacks like that work because the attachment a victim is asked to download can appear to be a legitimate piece of software that will fool a sales employee or dispatcher. It may also evade antivirus or network detections because the installers are often digitally signed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Selena Larson, a co-author of the Proofpoint report, says the scheme also works because the trucking industry needs salespeople and dispatchers to act fast on proposed offers. Pushing targets to act fast is an essential strategy for many phishing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack strategy described in this week’s Proofpoint report isn’t new: The company’s researchers&lt;a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-actor-uses-compromised-accounts-customized-social-engineering"&gt; issued a similar warning last September&lt;/a&gt; about email campaigns aimed at transportation and logistics companies that often used messages with Google Drive URLs leading to an internet shortcut (.URL) file, or a .URL file attached directly to the message. If executed, it uses the server message block (SMB) file sharing protocol to access an executable on a remote share, which installs the malware. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new campaign, a threat actor has added the use of remote access tools. Proofpoint isn’t sure if the same threat actor is behind both campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Larson agreed both campaigns are similar to targeted phishing attacks against a wide range of industries that have been going on for years, and involve trying to trick an employee into clicking on a malicious link or document.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proofpoint says it has seen nearly two dozen campaigns since August targeting logistics companies to deliver RMMs. The threat actor does not appear to attack specific sizes of companies: Targets range from small, family-owned businesses to large transport firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="value-of-stolen-shipments-has-doubled"&gt;Value of stolen shipments has doubled&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to determine the size of this IT-related cargo theft problem. The US National Insurance Crime Bureau estimates cargo theft losses from all sources increased 27% last year compared to 2023, to $35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Versik CargoNet, a company that tracks physical supply chain crime for law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, and distributors in the US and Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.verisk.com/company/newsroom/cargo-theft-holds-steady-in-q3organized-crime-drives-surge-in-high-value-cargo-theft-across-u.s.-and-canada/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;estimated in its Q3 report&lt;/a&gt; that the most recent quarterly losses due to theft were more than $111 million from 772 cargo theft events. Because there isn’t mandatory reporting of thefts, the true number would be larger. About 40% of that $111 million total could be IT-enabled fraud, said Keith Lewis, Versik CargoNet’s vice president of operations. That includes phishing, smishing, stealing of internet domains, spoofing, buying legitimate companies to abuse their names and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hacking ERP systems to re-direct freight isn’t happening yet, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average stolen shipment value doubled to $336,787, up from $168,448 in Q3 2024, “clear evidence that cargo thieves are becoming more strategic in selecting targets,” the Versik CargoNet report says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Organized crime groups are in a transitional phase, adapting to anti-fraud tools deployed across the logistics industry,” the report adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once criminals know where trucks are going, the most common locations for cargo theft are truck stops and parking lots, distribution centers and warehouses, ports and rail yards, highways and rest areas, it said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="classic-phishing"&gt;‘Classic phishing’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id=""&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.digitaldefence.ca/company/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Beggs,&lt;/a&gt; head of Canadian incident response firm DigitalDefence, calls the Proofpoint report a description of  “a classic phishing scheme, but one that is particularly successful due to the nature of logistics operations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although this is a new variant of previous campaigns, those attacks have also been successful because trucking is a round the clock operation that is largely remote, he said, so endpoints may not always have connectivity and facilities in place to ensure trust. The risk is increased because this is an industry that is time-sensitive, he pointed out.  A trucker with a load has to obtain approval to move, ensure papers are in order, and have sufficient cash on hand to meet immediate demands. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Together, these factors are tailor-made to support social engineering attacks,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trucking may appear to be a low-tech industry, Beggs noted, because generally it avoids strong cybersecurity controls.  However, its operations demand that such controls exist, especially when it comes to advancing funds or controlling information about high-value loads. At a minimum, firms in this sector must use multi-factor authentication for logins and ensure access to critical systems is monitored for proper use and the presence of any anomalies. Some companies use code words or expressions in messages to identify critical loads for an extra level of privacy, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Truckers have always been perceived to be a weak link, especially due to their limited practice of cybersecurity,” Beggs said. However, they are a critical part of any nation’s infrastructure and will likely continue to be targeted by social engineering and other attack types.&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellespinelli11/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vulnerable-tms-systems"&gt;Vulnerable TMS systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellespinelli11/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellespinelli11/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Danielle Spinelli&lt;/a&gt;, a former transportation broker and now account executive at Descartes Systems Group, which sells broker, transportation management, and ecommerce solutions, often speaks to the industry on cybersecurity and cargo theft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said one problem is the large number of ‘fly-by-night’ TMS (transportation management systems) that can easily be hacked.  TMS providers have customer and truck load information that crooks want. Another point of vulnerability, she added, is poorly-secured ELD (electronic log device) providers that can be hacked or provide an entry point to TMS systems. ELDs are devices in trucks that automatically record a drivers’ driving time, duty status, and other information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At greatest risk are one or two person cargo hauling firms who do business through free email accounts, Spinelli added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is implementing anti-fraud initiatives that IT departments can leverage, she said. That includes requiring new commercial driver applicants to match their government documents with a facial scan. She also recommends logistics companies use technology platforms that combine FMCSA authority data with historical tracking performance, vehicle identification number verification, geo-location, and insurance validation before a truck is dispatched.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem of cargo theft is increasingly getting the attention of the C-suite, said Versik CargoNet’s Lewis. They are now pushing for their security departments to hire IT people who have the same skills as those who work for financial institutions for tracing fraud and theft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the future, he worries that crooks will make increasing use of AI to enable their cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="need-for-cybersecurity-101"&gt;Need for Cybersecurity 101&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry is adopting technology solutions to combat cargo theft; for example, CargoNet just launched RouteScore API, which uses an algorithm to create a cargo theft route risk score for US and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what’s also needed is Cybersecurity 101. Spinelli of Descartes says the first thing IT and infosec leaders should do is increase employee security awareness training about how to recognize phishing attacks and the need to resist the urge to click on every attachment. They should require admins and users of logistics-related applications to reset their admin and user passwords every three to six months. And companies should make sure there are good off-boarding procedures to cancel IT access when an employee leaves the firm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proofpoint urges firms in the cargo transportation sector to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restrict the download and installation of any RMM tooling that is not approved and confirmed by an organization’s information technology administrators;   &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;have network detections in place – including using the Emerging Threats ruleset – and use endpoint protection. This can alert of any network activity to RMM servers;   &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;not allow employees to download and install executable files (.exe or .msi) from email or texts from external senders;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;train employees to identify and report suspicious activity to their security teams. This training can easily be integrated into an existing user training program.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>10 promising cybersecurity startups CISOs should know about</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080699/10-promising-cybersecurity-startups-cisos-should-know-about.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coming up with an accurate head count for cybersecurity startups is virtually impossible, with a new ventures popping up seemingly every day. And there’s no industry standard for how many years it takes before a startup should cease being called a startup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, industry veteran Richard Stiennon, who tracks cybersecurity vendors on his &lt;a href="https://dashboard.it-harvest.com/"&gt;IT-Harvest dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, lists more than 4,000 companies in the cybersecurity sector, startup or not, including more than 170 AI security vendors alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this article, we have set 2020 as a cutoff for defining a startup, so any vendor founded before then has been excluded from consideration. Because there are dozens of startups worthy of note, we’ve also decided that highlighting a cross-section of vendors with different areas of focus is worthwhile given the range of cyber work undertaken by cyber startups today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In otherwise determining this list, criteria include the amount of venture capital raised, acquisitions (if any), management team, awards recognition, and the company’s ability to articulate a clear strategic vision that resonates with enterprise security professionals, CISOs particularly. Virtually all these vendors are privately held, but those that announce strong revenue growth and customer wins get extra points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-astrix-security"&gt;1. Astrix Security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-human identity (NHI) security&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: For every human user in an enterprise, there could be dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2132294/what-are-non-human-identities-and-why-do-they-matter.html"&gt;non-human identities executing machine-to-machine interactions&lt;/a&gt;. These include API keys, service accounts, and AI agents making autonomous decisions. Astrix argues that these &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3476130/nhis-may-be-your-biggest-and-most-neglected-security-hole.html"&gt;NHIs constitute a blind spot&lt;/a&gt; in most enterprise security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Astrix provides visibility into non-human identities, and automatically detects and remediates overprivileged, unnecessary, and malicious access to prevent supply chain attacks and data leaks. Founded in 2021 by two veterans of the Israel Defense Force military intelligence unit, CEO Alon Jackson and CTO Idan Gour, Astrix has raised $85M in funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://menlovc.com/team/rama-sekhar/"&gt;Rama Sekhar&lt;/a&gt;, a partner at Menlo Ventures, says, “Astrix is tackling the challenge of securing non-human identities head-on by addressing the full lifecycle of NHIs, ensuring that enterprises can automate confidently and securely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-chainguard"&gt;2. Chainguard&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Software supply chain security&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 2021 by Dan Lorenc (formerly at Microsoft and Google), Chainguard offers a Linux-based platform for securely building applications. The company has raised more than $600M and is valued at $3.5B. In fiscal year 2025, Chainguard reached a $40M annual run rate and by the end of fiscal 2026, expects to hit $100M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chainguard automated build system, Chainguard Factory, includes Chainguard OS, which it describes as “zero-trust immutable infrastructure.” The platform includes libraries, as well as more than 1,700 trusted container images. Chainguard recently extended the platform to virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/investors/mamoon-hamid/"&gt;Mamoon Hamid&lt;/a&gt;, partner at Kleiner Perkins, says, “The speed at which Chainguard has established itself as the go-to provider for trusted open-source software is remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-cyera"&gt;3. Cyera&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category: &lt;/strong&gt;Data security posture management (DSPM)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 2021 by Israeli military veterans Yota Segev (CEO) and Tamar Bar-Ilan (CTO), New York-headquartered Cyera has raised an astounding $1.3B, including $540M in Series E funding in June. The company is valued at $6B.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyera is taking a platform approach to data security in the age of AI. The company just bought Israeli data loss prevention (DLP) startup Trail Security for $162M to help fill out its portfolio.  On top of its core products, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3518733/ai-spm-buyers-guide-artificial-intelligence-security-posture-management-tools-compared.html"&gt;AI-SPM&lt;/a&gt;, which inventories AI assets, and AI Runtime Protection, which monitors and responds to AI risks in real-time, Cyera recently launched AI Guardian, aimed at securing any type of AI, as well as DataWatcher, a managed SPM service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickbackhouse/"&gt;Patrick Backhouse&lt;/a&gt;, partner at Greenoaks, “We believe Cyera has built the world’s best data security platform, with a classification engine that is dramatically better than the rules-based paradigm, and which has earned genuine love from CISOs across industries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-drata"&gt;4. Drata&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; AI-powered governance, risk, compliance (GRC)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Drata has achieved 60% year-over-year growth and hit $100M in annual recurring revenue with its security compliance automation platform. Drata says it has attracted more than 7,000 global customers since its founding in 2020. Earlier this year, Drata acquired SafeBase, which automates software security reviews, for $250M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drata’s vision is a trust management platform that not only changes GRC from a manual to an automated process, but also transforms GRC from a cost center to a business accelerator. The company has launched an AI agent as well as the Drata Model Context Protocol (MCP). The goal is a fully agentic platform where AI agents act on behalf of end users to evaluate risks, validate evidence, trigger workflows, and manage trust autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-island-technology"&gt;5. Island Technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Secure enterprise browser&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Browsers might not be as exciting as AI, but a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573875/secure-web-browsers-for-the-enterprise-compared-how-to-pick-the-right-one.html"&gt;secure enterprise browser&lt;/a&gt; is becoming an important element in a layered defense. Gartner predicts that “by 2028, 25% of organizations will augment existing secure remote access and endpoint security tools by deploying at least one secure enterprise browser.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter Island Technology, which launched its Chromium-based Enterprise Browser in 2022. The browser is designed to provide a safe workspace for users as they access SaaS and other web apps, with its built-in safe browsing, web filtering, web isolation, exploit prevention, and zero-trust network access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Dallas-based company, founded by industry veterans Mike Fey and Dan Amiga, has raised $730M and is valued at $4.8B. Island says it has more than 450 enterprise customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-mimic"&gt;6. Mimic&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Ransomware defense&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto-based Mimic was founded in 2023 by Derek Smith, former CEO of Shape Security. Mimic bills itself as the last line of defense against ransomware with its kernel-level approach to detecting and deflecting attacks. The company also provides a rapid recovery feature that helps organizations spin up critical assets that “mimic” the enterprise’s original data stores so they can avoid paying a ransom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mimic’s ability to detect and deflect ransomware so much faster than traditional defenses is unique in the market,” says Google Ventures General Partner &lt;a href="https://www.gv.com/team/karim-faris"&gt;Karim Faris&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe Mimic’s capabilities, combined with their use of AI, will become part of every CISO’s minimum required defense strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mimic recently announced the launch of Mimic Signal Generator, a new capability that enables customers to simulate the impact of ransomware attacks in a controlled environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-noma-security"&gt;7. Noma Security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; AI security/AI agent security&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Recognized by Gartner as a “Cool Vendor” in AI security, Noma provides an AI and agent security and governance platform that includes discovery for AI asset and agent attack surfaces, AI security posture management and risk prioritization, runtime controls for blocking malicious prompts and destructive agent actions; automated AI red teaming and compliance support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://evolutionequity.com/team/richard-seewald/"&gt;Richard Seewald&lt;/a&gt;, Evolution Equity Partners founder, said, “We chose to invest in Noma Security based on two main factors. First, the Noma Security founding team had the foresight to build a comprehensive AI security and governance platform to address all CISO challenges related to AI security. Second, as evidenced by rapid customer growth, Noma Security quickly found product-market fit within the enterprise CISO’s organization with a solution for agentic AI security and governance.” Noma was founded in 2023 and has already raised $135M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-reality-defender"&gt;8. Reality Defender&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; Deepfake detection&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; Reality Defender was selected as a winner in the 2024 SINET16 Innovator Awards and was named the most innovative company at the 2024 RSA Innovation Sandbox. Founded in 2021 by Ben Colman, Reality Defender is a detection platform designed to spot deepfakes across audio, video, images, and text. Investors include Booz Allen Ventures, IBM Ventures, Accenture, DCVC, and Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reality Defender trains its algorithms on massive datasets of both authentic and generated media. This enables it to “analyze pixel-level traces in video and frequency patterns in audio to find signals invisible to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Reality Defender has swiftly established itself as the industry leader in deepfake detection,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dcvc.com/team/ali-tamaseb/"&gt;Ali Tamaseb&lt;/a&gt;, a general partner at DCVC&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; “It offers vitally needed protection against emerging digital threats against enterprises, governments, and the world’s largest banks and financial institutions.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-upwind"&gt;9. Upwind&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:  &lt;/strong&gt;Cloud native application protection platform (CNAAP)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here:&lt;/strong&gt; San Francisco-based Upwind has raised $180M, reported 4,000% year-over-year revenue growth in 2024, 40% customer expansion, and more than 30 product updates. Upwind is challenging &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573629/cnapp-buyers-guide-top-tools-compared.html"&gt;legacy CNAPP vendors&lt;/a&gt; with a runtime-first detection and protection platform that covers every layer of the cloud stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upwind’s unified CNAPP platform integrates &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/657138/how-to-choose-the-best-cloud-security-posture-management-tools.html"&gt;cloud security posture management (CSPM)&lt;/a&gt;, cloud workload protection, cloud detection and response, vulnerability management, and identity security, and grounds it in live runtime activity. Customers report up to 95% fewer alerts and faster time-to-remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, there were reports that Datadog was in talks to buy Upwind; however, no acquisition has taken place. Upwind was founded in 2022 by Amiram Shachar, who founded Spot, a &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/189652/top-13-cloud-cost-management-tools.html"&gt;cloud cost optimization platform&lt;/a&gt;, and sold it to NetApp for $450M.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-zenity"&gt;10. Zenity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category:&lt;/strong&gt; AI trust, risk, and security management (AITRiSM)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why they’re here&lt;/strong&gt;: Zenity was selected as the “Agentic AI Security Solution of the Year” by the &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zenity-named-agentic-ai-security-140300911.html"&gt;CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards&lt;/a&gt; program, and was also cited as a “Cool Vendor” by Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zenity offers a comprehensive platform that governs how AI agents are built, what they can access, and what they can do, in real-time. The platform includes discovery of all agents across SaaS, cloud, and endpoints; governance in the form of applying policies; and continuous monitoring of agent behavior to detect malicious intent. The company, founded by Ben Kliger, a former Microsoft employee, has raised $38M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Louvre-Raubzug offenbart jahrzehntelanges Security-Versagen</title>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Louvre Museum broken window burglary" class="wp-image-4084014" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Louvre_Museum_broken_window_burglary_shutterstock_2692082701.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Windows-Sicherheitsprobleme haben beim Louvre-Museum scheinbar Tradition.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a class="imageCredit" href="https://enterprise.shutterstock.com/image-photo/paris-october-19-2025-french-police-2692082701" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterstock / Phil Pasquini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Louvre-Museum in Paris wurde im Oktober 2025 bekanntlich von Einbrechern heimgesucht und auf &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/louvre-thieves-slow-motion-getaway-caught-on-video" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ziemlich dreiste Art und Weise&lt;/a&gt; um Juwelen im Wert von circa 88 Millionen Euro erleichtert. Die Diebe nutzten für ihren Raubzug einen Möbelaufzug (&lt;a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/regional/nordrheinwestfalen/wdr-moebelaufzug-von-juwelen-raub-kommt-aus-werne-firma-wirbt-damit-100.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made in Germany&lt;/a&gt;), um durch ein Fenster im zweiten Stock des Louvre einzusteigen und die historischen Schmuckstücke aus ihren Vitrinen zu stehlen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sowohl die Alarmsysteme am betroffenen Fenster als auch an den Vitrinen haben dabei laut &lt;a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/presse/communiques-de-presse/informations-relatives-au-vol-par-effraction-survenu-ce-dimanche-19-octobre-au-musee-du-louvre" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dem französischen Kulturministerium&lt;/a&gt; wie vorgesehen funktioniert. Der Einbruch führte zu einer umfassenden Überprüfung der Sicherheitsvorkehrungen des Louvre. In einer &lt;a href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/presse/communiques-de-presse/enquete-administrative-confiee-a-l-igac-a-la-suite-du-vol-survenu-au-musee-du-louvre-premieres-conclusions-et-mesures-d-urgence" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ersten Reaktion&lt;/a&gt; empfahl die französische Behörde für kulturelle Angelegenheiten kürzlich:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neue Governance-Regeln und Security-Richtlinien einzuführen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;zusätzliche Sicherheitskameras rund um den Gebäude-Perimeter zu installieren, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;sämtliche Sicherheitsprotokolle und -prozesse bis Jahresende zu aktualisieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist laut einem &lt;a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/louvre-en-mot-de-passe-logiciels-obsoletes-mises-a-jour-impossibles-dix-ans-de-failles-dans-la-securite-informatique-du-premier-musee-au-monde-20251101_RD5YGV6WMVAXLL6U3SRGVFBIBY/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aktuellen Bericht&lt;/a&gt; der französischen Tageszeitung Libération auch dringend nötig – nicht nur mit Blick auf den Millionenraub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="wer-braucht-schon-updates"&gt;“Wer braucht schon Updates?”&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denn die Journalisten von Libération konnten diverse vertrauliche &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492356/security-standard-wie-sie-sich-auf-ein-soc-2-audit-vorbereiten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Audits&lt;/a&gt; der Sicherheitssysteme des Louvre-Museums einsehen. Demnach gab es bereits 2014 und 2017 eklatante IT-Sicherheitsprobleme. So sei bei einem Audit durch die französische Cybersicherheitsbehörde ANSSI im Jahr 2014 festgestellt worden, dass das Office-Automation-Netzwerk des Louvre auf Windows 2000 lief – drei Jahre nachdem Microsoft die Security-Updates für sein Legacy-Betriebssystem eingestellt hatte. Ein weiteres haarsträubendes Highlight des Berichts: Ein Videoüberwachungssystem, dessen Server mit Passwort LOUVRE “abgesichert” war. Laut dem Bericht von Libération wurde den Louvre-Verantwortlichen damals seitens ANSSI empfohlen, komplexe &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492356/security-standard-wie-sie-sich-auf-ein-soc-2-audit-vorbereiten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Passwörter&lt;/a&gt; einzusetzen, Schwachstellen zu patchen und seine Software zu aktualisieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dass man diesen Empfehlungen offenbar nicht nachgekommen ist, zeigt der zweite Audit-Report aus dem Jahr 2017 – diesmal durchgeführt von der dem französischen Innenministerium unterstellten Behörde &lt;a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_national_des_hautes_%C3%A9tudes_de_la_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_et_de_la_justice" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;INHESJ&lt;/a&gt;. Diese Prüfer stellten laut Libération drei Jahre später ebenfalls fest, dass Arbeitsplätze mit veralteten Betriebssystemen wie Windows 2000 und XP (Support seitens Microsoft 2014 eingestellt) ausgestattet waren und beanstandeten eine laxe Passworthygiene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Und die Windows-Probleme des Louvre setzten sich auch danach weiter fort – mindestens bis zum Jahr 2021. So wurde etwa ein Videoüberwachungssystem des französischen Unternehmens Thales im Jahr 2003 eingeführt. Dokumenten zufolge lief dieses bis zum Jahr 2021 auf einem Rechner mit Windows Server 2003 (erweiterter Support 2015 ausgelaufen) – obwohl die Applikation schon seit 2019 keinen Support und damit auch keine Sicherheits-Updates mehr erhielt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es gibt zwar keine Anzeichen dafür, dass die langjährigen Softwareprobleme des Louvre mit dem Millionenraub aus dem Oktober 2025 in Zusammenhang stehen. Dennoch lassen die nun bekannt gewordenen Umstände erkennen, dass die Verantwortlichen des Museums wohl nicht nur die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493920/10-essenzielle-masnahmen-fur-physische-sicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;physische Security&lt;/a&gt; vernachlässigt haben.

      <title>Operation Chargeback: 4.3 million cardholders affected, EUR 300 million in damages</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-chargeback-43-million-cardholders-affected-eur-300-million-in-damages</link>
      <description>On 4 November 2025, an international coordinated action day targeted three major fraud and money laundering networks as part of Operation “Chargeback.” Led by the Cybercrime Department (Landeszentralstelle Cybercrime) of the General Prosecutor's Office (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) in Koblenz, Germany, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the operation has been investigating these networks since December 2020. More than 60 house searches were conducted and a total of 18 arrest warrants executed. The criminal networks are suspected of misusing credit card data from over 4.3 million cardholders across 193 countries. In total, the estimated damage from the fraud scheme exceeds EUR 300 million, with attempted damages amounting to over EUR 750 million.</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>Office sandbox file security to disappear from enterprise Windows by late 2027, Microsoft confirms</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085172/office-sandbox-file-security-to-disappear-from-enterprise-windows-by-late-2027-microsoft-confirms-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windows enterprise administrators will have until December 2027 at the latest to put in place alternatives to the security protection offered by Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG) for Office, the company has confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MDAG’s purpose is to protect customers from the threat of boobytrapped Office documents sent via email. The feature was added to some Office subscription tiers from 2019 onwards, but Microsoft announced in &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;November 2023&lt;/a&gt; that the feature was nearing the end of the road, since when customers have been waiting for more detail on how and when this would happen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1182696" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s new timeline&lt;/a&gt; on its customer portal, removal will begin with Office version 2602 for the Current Patch Tuesday Channel in February 2026, the Monthly Enterprise Channel in April 2026, and the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel in July 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Full removal will happen for Office version 2612 by December 2026 for the Current Channel, February 2027 for the Monthly Enterprise Channel, and July 2027 for the Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ambiguously, the timeline also lists December 2027 as the final date for removal, although it’s likely that the later date is a final cut-off for customers with extended support licenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="isolation-overhead"&gt;Isolation overhead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of opening files in main memory, MDAG opens files in a Hyper-V sandbox, thereby isolating any malware executed from the operating system. The concept is sound, but it comes with the inconvenience of much slower document load times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It could also be undermined by occasional vulnerabilities in the isolation layer, an example of which would be &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-26706" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2022-26706&lt;/a&gt;, a sandbox escape flaw &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/07/13/uncovering-a-macos-app-sandbox-escape-vulnerability-a-deep-dive-into-cve-2022-26706/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;affecting macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is replacing MDAG with two security layers it claims do the same job: &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)&lt;/a&gt; rules and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/wdac" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ASR is a rules-based mechanism for blocking malicious scripts, executables, or code injection. While the performance is much improved, one potential downside is that it relies on behavioral analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens if attackers use a novel technique not yet picked up by ASR? Microsoft’s view is that they rarely do because most malicious document attacks exploit predictable techniques. Backed by cloud-based machine learning, the chances of an innovative attack getting past ASR are claimed to be small.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, WDAC analysis, which executes at kernel level, blocks applications by monitoring digital signatures, file hashes, and other reputation signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="admin-workload"&gt;Admin workload&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that the removal process happens automatically, what’s left for administrators to do?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although many enterprise IT teams are probably not hugely aware of MDAG, there could still be hidden work caused by its removal. Microsoft, for its part, recommends that administrators do the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable Microsoft Defender for Endpoint &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/overview-attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ASR&lt;/a&gt; rules to block risky Office file behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/wdac" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC)&lt;/a&gt; to ensure only trusted, signed code runs on devices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Review internal documentation and helpdesk guidance if your organization previously relied on Application Guard for Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, MDAG’s deprecation could still cause problems for customers that have built it into automated workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A generic example of this would be an automated workflow script that will only allow an Office document to be opened once it has passed through MDAG. If MDAG is no longer present, that script will need to be re-written — and procedures changed if the logs from isolation security testing were being sent into SIEMs as part of compliance rules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although primarily affecting organizations with a cautious approach to Office documents such as critical infrastructure or government, this re-scripting could still turn into a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s not in doubt is the stress induced by the regular churn of new and deprecated features on a Windows platform that has gradually become byzantine in its complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, Computerworld has published a &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1682225/windows-10-a-guide-to-the-updates.html"&gt;regularly updated guide to Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; and 11 components and features as they appear, or disappear. Meanwhile, the arrival of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3996290/securing-windows-11-and-server-2025-what-cisos-should-know-about-the-latest-updates.html"&gt;Windows 11 has introduced&lt;/a&gt; several changes to the operating system’s underlying security architecture, many built around &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2121652/microsoft-amps-up-focus-on-windows-11-security-to-address-evolving-cyberthreats.html"&gt;Security Copilot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Russian APT abuses Windows Hyper-V for persistence and malware execution</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085272/russian-apt-abuses-windows-hyper-v-for-persistence-and-malware-execution.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberespionage groups are always looking for novel ways to establish covert and long-term persistent access to compromised systems. The latest example comes from a Russian APT group known as Curly COMrades, which deploys Linux-based virtual machines on compromised Windows 10 machines to hide their malware tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The attackers enabled the Hyper-V role on selected victim systems to deploy a minimalistic, Alpine Linux-based virtual machine,” researchers from Bitdefender wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-gb/blog/businessinsights/curly-comrades-evasion-persistence-hidden-hyper-v-virtual-machines"&gt;a report on Curly COMrades’ activity&lt;/a&gt;. “This hidden environment, with its lightweight footprint (only 120MB disk space and 256MB memory), hosted their custom reverse shell, CurlyShell, and a reverse proxy, CurlCat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V is a bare-metal hypervisor included in Windows 10 and 11 Pro and Enterprise editions, as well as Windows Server. When the feature is enabled, users can create virtual machines with different operating systems that run on the same hardware as the Windows host.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Curly COMrades is a Russia-aligned APT group first documented by Bitdefender in August after &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4039318/russian-apt-group-curly-comrades-employs-novel-backdoor-and-persistence-tricks.html"&gt;it targeted key government and judicial organizations from EU-hopefuls Moldova and Georgia&lt;/a&gt;. The name comes from the group’s heavy usage of the curl.exe tool and its hijacking of Component Object Model (COM) objects for persistence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group is known for other novel techniques, such as inserting malware into the CLSID and COM handler associated with a Windows scheduled task that is enabled and executed by the system periodically when .NET applications are installed or updated. The obscure scheduled task corresponds to a Microsoft tool called NGEN (Native Image Generator).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group’s Hyper-V abuse came to light after Bitdefender researchers continued their forensic investigation of the group’s activities and compromises with the help of the Georgian government’s CERT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By isolating the malware and its execution environment within a VM, the attackers effectively bypassed many traditional host-based EDR detections,” the researchers concluded. “EDR needs to be complemented by host-based network inspection to detect C2 traffic escaping the VM, and proactive hardening tools to restrict the initial abuse of native system binaries.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enabling-hyper-v-covertly"&gt;Enabling Hyper-V covertly&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Logs extracted from a compromised system revealed that the attackers first used the Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command-line tool to enable the Hyper-V hypervisor itself, while also disabling its graphical management interface, Hyper-V Manager.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group then downloaded a RAR archive masquerading as an MP4 video file and extracted its contents. The archive contained two VHDX (virtual hard disk) and VMCX (virtual machine configuration) files corresponding to a pre-built Alpine Linux VM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers then used the Import-VM and Start-VM PowerShell cmdlets to import the virtual machine into Hyper-V and start it with the name WSL — a deception tactic given that WSL on Windows stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, another feature that allows running Linux containers under the Windows kernel. More popular than Hyper-V for virtualization on Windows, WSL is widely used by developers, making its presence less likely to receive scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Alpine Linux VM is very small and hosts only two custom implants that Bitdefender has dubbed CurlyShell and CurlCat. They are both built using libcurl, an open-source network transfer library that supports a large variety of protocols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CurlyShell uses libcurl to connect to a command-and-control (C2) server and set up a reverse shell, meaning it listens for commands issued by the server, passes them to the Linux command line, and returns the output. Meanwhile, CurlCat acts as a proxy for tunneling SSH traffic as HTTP requests, making that traffic harder to detect by network monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-malware-tools"&gt;Other malware tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found additional malware payloads left by the attackers on systems, including a custom PowerShell script used to inject a Kerberos ticket into LSASS to enable authentication and command execution on remote systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another PowerShell script was pushed to multiple systems via domain Group Policy to change the password of an account called user or to create it if it didn’t exist. A variant of this script targeted an account called camera instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of the Georgian CERT who seized one of the group’s C2 servers, the researchers were also able to analyze how attackers had set up their infrastructure, which proved equally sophisticated. The attackers had disabled certificate revocation in CurlCat, which allowed them to deploy custom certificates on their C2 server and still use encrypted HTTPS traffic. A proxy server listening to incoming traffic on port 443 (HTTPS) then decrypted and relayed that traffic to an SSH server with a custom configuration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The sophistication demonstrated by Curly COMrades confirms a key trend: as EDR/XDR solutions become commodity tools, threat actors are getting better at bypassing them through tooling or techniques like VM isolation,” the researchers said. “To counter this, organizations must move beyond relying on a single security layer and implement defense-in-depth, multilayered security. It is critical to start designing the entire environment to be hostile to attackers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bitdefender &lt;a href="https://github.com/bitdefender/malware-ioc/blob/master/2025_11_04-curlycomrades-iocs.csv"&gt;published indicators of compromise&lt;/a&gt; related to this attack campaign on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/560279/why-you-need-a-bug-bounty-program.html"&gt;Bug bounty programs&lt;/a&gt; remain a crucial component of cybersecurity strategies in 2025, offering organizations the ability to draw in help from a diverse pool of cybersecurity professionals and researchers. The schemes offer continuous testing against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are bug bounty programs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bug bounty programs are structured systems for individuals to identify and report &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619312/software-bugs-that-bug-me-and-how-to-swat-them-down.html"&gt;security vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; and other bugs. They are offered by organizations, websites, and software developers. These programs are designed to leverage the skills of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/644922/hackrate-releases-ethical-hacking-monitoring-platform-hackgate.html"&gt;ethical hackers&lt;/a&gt; to enhance the security of software and systems before malicious parties can exploit these vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants, often referred to as bug bounty hunters, earn financial rewards or other forms of recognition for successfully reporting vulnerabilities in assets covered by bug bounty programs. Exploits achieved through social engineering trickery such as phishing are typically excluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bug bounty programs focus in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For ethical hackers, best practice for bug bounty hunting in 2025 involves thorough reconnaissance of a target organization’s technology stack, rather than just running automated tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leading bug bounty platforms such as Bugcrowd, HackerOne, Synack, YesWeHack, and Intigriti offer rewards for identifying and reporting security vulnerabilities. Platforms connect ethical hackers with organizations, providing a structured framework for vulnerability disclosure and resolution — managing bug bounty rewards on behalf of their corporate clients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology providers and government organizations run stand-alone bug bounty programs as part of a broader security testing strategy that also includes penetration tests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past 12 months bug bounties have begun offering increased payouts and broader scope. Traditional web and mobile categories are being supplemented by an &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082265/ai-powered-bug-hunting-shakes-up-bounty-industry-for-better-or-worse.html"&gt;increased focus on AI systems&lt;/a&gt; and critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the past year, Accenture has seen bug bounty go AI-assisted at scale: Researchers lean on AI, programs incorporate AI systems in bounty scope, and prompt-injection findings have surged,” Ryan Whelan, Accenture global cyber intelligence lead, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vendors now pay for full exploit chains, not one-off bugs,” Whelan says, adding that this shows how the bug bounty market has matured to reward researchers for vulnerabilities that have “real-world impact and reproducibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are the notable programs launched or expanded in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="apple-increases-rewards-and-expands-bounty-program"&gt;Apple increases rewards and expands bounty program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071044/apple-bumps-rce-bug-bounties-to-2m-to-counter-commercial-spyware-vendors.html"&gt;Apple doubled the maximum reward for zero-click iPhone remote exploits&lt;/a&gt; from $1 million to $2 million, with additional bonuses for uncovering complex exploit chains pushing potential payouts up to $5 million or more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apple also significantly increased rewards in other categories to encourage more intensive research. This includes $100,000 for a complete macOS Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vendor also added WebKit browser and wireless proximity exploits into the scope of its revamped Apple Security Bounty program. The most severe One-click WebKit sandbox escapes can earn up to $300,000. Payouts of up $1 million are payable for wireless proximity exploits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The updates — which come into effect in November 2025 — are in response to a febrile threat environment, exemplified by sophisticated exploit chains historically associated with state actors that are being harnessed by spyware vendors in targeted attacks, &lt;a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/"&gt;Apple warns in a blog post on its revamped program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="google-launches-dedicated-ai-related-bug-bounty-program"&gt;Google launches dedicated AI-related bug bounty program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bughunters.google.com/blog/6116887259840512/announcing-google-s-new-ai-vulnerability-reward-program"&gt;Google launched a dedicated AI Vulnerability Reward Program in October 2025&lt;/a&gt;. The scheme aims to incentivize security researchers to focus on uncovering previously undiscovered flaws in the vendor’s AI-based product and services, such as Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eligible exploits include those that lead to unauthorized account or data modifications, data exfiltration, model theft, or phishing enablement. Rewards operate in tiers from $5,000 up to $30,000. Prompt injections or jailbreaks are out of scope and not eligible for any rewards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tech giant also increased the rewards offered through its core bug bounty program, increasing the highest category rewards for researchers who discover flaws in Google Chrome to $250,000. Expanded categories and higher rewards pushed the total amount paid out by &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/03/vulnerability-reward-program-2024-in.html"&gt;Google’s Vulnerability Reward Program&lt;/a&gt; to $12 million throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-continues-zero-day-quest"&gt;Microsoft continues Zero Day Quest&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-ai"&gt;Microsoft expanded its AI Copilot bug bounty&lt;/a&gt;, with rewards up to $30,000 for code injection and other severe vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technology giant also announced plans for its largest hacking event, “&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/08/zero-day-quest-join-the-largest-hacking-event-with-up-to-5-million-in-total-bounty-awards/"&gt;Zero Day Quest&lt;/a&gt;,” due to take place in spring 2026 and focused on uncovering cloud and AI vulnerabilities in products such as Microsoft Azure, Copilot, Identity, and M365.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next year’s event follows the successful conclusion of an inaugural event in April, which focused on high impact vulnerabilities in Copilot and cloud and led to payouts of more than $1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/08/microsoft-bounty-program-year-in-review-17-million-in-rewards"&gt;Microsoft paid out a total of $17 million&lt;/a&gt; to 344 security researchers this year, the company announced in August.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="samsung-puts-a-premium-on-mobile-security"&gt;Samsung puts a premium on mobile security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/rewardsProgram.smsb"&gt;Samsung launched a new bug bounty for mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;, offering up to $1 million for ethical hackers who discover and report critical flaws in core mobile systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highest awards are on offer for high-impact bugs that present an arbitrary code execution risk on highly privileged targets or that bypass in-built security protections such as the Knox Vault or the TEEGRIS OS security platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The program covers vulnerabilities in Samsung’s smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, personal computers, services, and applications. Potential rewards vary depending on product as well as the severity of uncovered flaws.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="anthropic-offers-rewards-for-jailbreaking-claude"&gt;Anthropic offers rewards for jailbreaking Claude&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/testing-our-safety-defenses-with-a-new-bug-bounty-program"&gt;Anthropic launched a new bug bounty initiative&lt;/a&gt;, run through HackerOne, to stress-test advanced safety classifiers protecting Claude models. The invite-only trial program offered rewards of up to $25,0000 for vulnerabilities that reliably bypass AI safety constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scheme ran for a few weeks before it was replaced by a &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/policy_scopes"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; focused on stress-testing &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/constitutional-classifiers"&gt;Constitutional Classifiers system&lt;/a&gt; on the new Claude Opus 4 model. In August the scheme was further refined to offer &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-safety-bug-bounty"&gt;rewards of up to $15,000 to pre-invited researchers who identify AI safety mitigation shortcomings&lt;/a&gt; in early pre-release versions of Anthropic’s Claude AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="openai-levels-up-bug-bounty-reward-program"&gt;OpenAI levels up bug bounty reward program&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March, &lt;a href="https://opentools.ai/news/openai-cranks-up-bug-bounty-rewards-to-dollar100k-why-its-a-winning-move-for-ai-security"&gt;OpenAI dramatically increased the potential payouts for those who discovered critical vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; in its AI models and infrastructure from $20,000 to $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assets that are in scope include ChatGPT, Open AI’s APIs, Open API corporate information and website, as explained in much more depth in &lt;a href="https://bugcrowd.com/engagements/openai"&gt;Open AI’s program page on Bugcrowd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nvidia-scales-up-security-defenses"&gt;Nvidia scales up security defenses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chip giant &lt;a href="https://www.intigriti.com/blog/business-insights/intigriti-teams-with-nvidia-to-launch-bug-bounty-vulnerability-disclosure-program"&gt;Nvidia has teamed up with bug bounty platform Intigriti&lt;/a&gt; to launch a bug bounty and no financial reward vulnerability disclosure program (VDP), which is due to go live early in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nvidia products will be covered by a private bug bounty program. An additional private bug bounty package will cover core AI assets. The VDP extends to all other Nvidia assets, such as its website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="shields-up"&gt;Shields up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Belgian higher eduction and healthcare tech provider &lt;a href="https://www.intigriti.com/blog/news/intigriti-partners-with-shield-to-empower-security-within-healthcare"&gt;Shield has partnered with Intigriti to launch a vulnerability disclosure program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[The] partnership provides essential support and services on vulnerability disclosure programs for critical national infrastructure (CNI) organizations such as hospitals, that now need to comply with NIS2 [EU cybersecurity regulation],” Intigriti said in a statement about the deal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last December virtual assets platform &lt;a href="https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/cryptocom-launches-landmark-usd-2-million-bug-bounty-program-hackerone"&gt;Crypto.com upgraded its existing bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/crypto?type=team"&gt;HackerOne&lt;/a&gt;, providing up to $2 million in rewards for the reporting of critical security vulnerabilities. The boost made the vendor’s technology the most lucrative target for bug bounty hunters before recent enhancement to Apple’s program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[For a look at last year’s top announcements, see “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4085288"&gt;12 notable bug bounty programs launched in 2024&lt;/a&gt;.”]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What past ERP mishaps can teach CISOs about security platformization</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080709/what-past-erp-mishaps-can-teach-cisos-about-security-platformization.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research studies indicate that the average enterprise has between 40 and 80 separate security tools, a broad inventory that often leads to multiple security data silos, integration challenges, constant maintenance and tuning, and alert fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the challenges of this situation and the potential market for unified solutions, cybersecurity technology vendors like Cisco, CrowdStrike, Fortinet, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, and Trend Micro have been cobbling together security technology “platforms” —integrated product bundles that aggregate areas such as cloud security, email security, endpoint security, network security, SIEM, threat intelligence, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Moving from independent tools to an integrated architecture with a centralized database acting as the single point of truth. Where have we heard this before?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="erp-migrations-set-the-stage-for-platform-challenges"&gt;ERP migrations set the stage for platform challenges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We older technologists may remember a similar migration to &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/272362/what-is-erp-key-features-of-top-enterprise-resource-planning-systems.html"&gt;enterprise resource planning (ERP)&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, large organizations had independent departmental applications in areas such as finance, inventory management, supply chain management, HR, and manufacturing, resulting in disparate processes, separate teams, and no centralized view of the business.  ERP systems promised a “central nervous system” for the business, aggregating departmental data into a single, shared database and providing a unified, real-time view of the company’s operations. Driven by Y2K, enterprises raced toward ERP nirvana throughout the decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alas, it wasn’t so easy. ERP migrations were fraught with challenges like incompatible data formats requiring massive ETL and data transformation efforts. Many firms faced long and arduous efforts to customize ERP for their industry and organizational needs. Some organizations &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/284312/10-common-erp-mistakes-to-avoid.html"&gt;botched project planning&lt;/a&gt; leading to lengthy implementations and cost overruns. And in their focus on a hasty technology transition, many firms forgot to execute necessary &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/272222/change-management-change-management-definition-and-solutions.html"&gt;organizational changes&lt;/a&gt; like gaining employee buy-in, modifying processes, and training technicians. This led to political strife and even outright project sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there’s no Y2K-like sword of Damocles hanging over CISOs’ heads, many security executives are considering security platforms for security efficacy, operational efficiency, and/or financial rationalization. Those still sitting on the fence are frequently persuaded by CFOs to at least consider this option. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-tips-for-getting-security-platformization-right"&gt;5 tips for getting security platformization right&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current trending suggests that in many enterprises, security platform migration is inevitable in the short- or long-term. Given this, CISOs would be well served by carefully studying the mistakes made with ERP and plan accordingly with proven best practices. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on my research, here are a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get executive buy-in and vocal leadership.&lt;/strong&gt; Successful ERP migrations were driven by clearly defined business goals and passionate executive teams. Similarly, security platform migration should go beyond limited security and/or financial benefits alone. CISOs should prepare a business case demonstrating how a security platform will improve business-critical system protection and deliver cyber resilience to the organization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the board of directors and executives are committed, they should oversee project implementation objectives, provide organizational and employee incentives for meeting success metrics, and visibly cheerlead the effort. For their part, CISOs should continually communicate project progress in business — not just technical — terms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus first on the security team, not the technology.&lt;/strong&gt; ERP migrations were often impaired by doubtful IT employees myopically focused on their pet technologies or limited responsibilities. Correspondingly, some security professionals will be reluctant to give up their favored tools (i.e., “server huggers”) and individual tasks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs must win over these naysayers by refocusing them on the overall mission of protecting the organization, and then carefully educate them on how a security platform aligns with this objective. Make sure to support the team with the services and training they’ll need for a successful technology transition and offer team and individual incentives to do so. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs would also be wise to think about folding career development opportunities into their security platform planning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan for project phases, not ‘big bang’ implementations.&lt;/strong&gt; ERP implementation challenges were often associated with overly aggressive project timelines. This led to project delays, cost overruns, and ultimately business impact. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one famous example, &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/284312/10-common-erp-mistakes-to-avoid.html"&gt;Hershey’s had an ERP-related system outage&lt;/a&gt; during the Halloween season and couldn’t ship products to its distributors. This led to lost market share, quarterly revenue impact, and a decrease in its share price. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To deliver value through a phased approach, organizations should start with a dependency map to understand &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;all the idiosyncrasies and connections of the existing architecture&lt;/a&gt;.  Clearly map out the future state, including data and workflows, and use this to determine how and where to start replacing tools. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Build an overlay implementation that mirrors the existing infrastructure. Create a test and rollback plan. Determine technical and business metrics — and executive reports — for each phase of the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should follow the adage and consider patience a virtue throughout the project. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start the technology journey with a modern data pipeline.&lt;/strong&gt; Once IT teams rolled up their sleeves toward ERP projects, they discovered data inconsistency everywhere. Finance systems referred to a major supplier as Acme Inc., CRM systems used ACME Incorporated, and each system used different customer numbers and billing addresses. This led to lengthy ETL processes to gain data reliability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should overcome similar issues by focusing on data pipelining for achieving data quality, consistency, and accessibility. This will help break down data silos and build a single source of cybersecurity truth. A scalable data pipeline will ultimately accelerate the delivery of trustworthy data for analytics and decision-making. Again, this will deliver security &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; business benefits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the transition for process re-engineering.&lt;/strong&gt; Too often, organizations tried to force fit existing business and technology processes into new ERP systems, leading to complex customization and political dissent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To avoid a similar fate, CISOs should use platformization as an opportunity to modernize and automate inefficient and/or manual processes using baked-in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567745/soapa-vs-soar-how-these-security-terms-differ.html"&gt;security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)&lt;/a&gt; and AI functionality. Make sure to find ways for removing security bottlenecks to business processes, such as onboarding new users or providing timely reports to business managers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, CISOs should make process re-engineering part of the planning, testing, and implementation aspects of the project. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="inflection-point-for-cisos"&gt;Inflection point for CISOs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the migration to ERP systems is often cited as an inflection point, when CIOs went from technical administrators to critical business executives. Prudent CISOs may benefit from platformization in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chinese hackers have been spotted targeting European diplomats using a longstanding Windows shortcut vulnerability that’s been popular with threat groups as far back as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to security company &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/unc6384-weaponizes-zdi-can-25373-vulnerability-to-deploy-plugx/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arctic Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, whose researchers uncovered the latest campaign, the latest attacks saw spear phishing emails sent to officials working for the governments of Hungary, Belgium, Serbia, Italy, and The Netherlands during September and October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government-operated group suspected of being behind the campaign is named UNC6384 by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). The same group is believed to have targeted diplomats of several Asian countries earlier in 2025, which might give the impression that UNC6384 is a recently discovered threat actor, hence its UNC (“uncategorized”) status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Arctic Wolf said it believed the group’s tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) strongly resemble those of a known Chinese threat group, “Mustang Panda,” which has been around since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, this looks like just another Chinese cyber-espionage campaign against foreign governments. But there is a deeper story: the Windows vulnerability used in the campaign, which Microsoft has so far been unwilling — or unable — to patch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ghost-flaw"&gt;Ghost flaw&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Arctic Wolf, the latest campaign used spear phishing emails with diplomatic themes to lure targets into executing malicious Windows .LNK shortcut files. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Windows UI parsing that allows command-line instructions to be hidden in &lt;a href="https://detection.fyi/sigmahq/sigma/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_susp_lnk_exec_hidden_cmd/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;.LNK format whitespace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows the attackers to launch a sequence of malicious actions while displaying a decoy PDF showing the agenda for a genuine European Commission meeting scheduled to have been held in Brussels on September 26. The result is the deployment of the PlugX remote access Trojan, which has been popular since 2008 as a tool for opening backdoors into Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trend Micro told Microsoft about the weakness in September 2024, after which it was given a &lt;a href="https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9491" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-9491&lt;/a&gt; identifier. However, it turns out that the company’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) had noticed the same issue in 2017, when it was given a separate internal ‘candidate’ identifier, &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ZDI-CAN-25373&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The vulnerability has been exploited by state-sponsored APT groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China,” said Trend Micro in a &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2018 blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite there being a formal CVE, Microsoft appears reluctant to address the issue. As Trend Micro noted in a more recent blog from 2025, “We submitted a proof-of-concept exploit through Trend ZDI’s bug bounty program to Microsoft, who declined to address this vulnerability with a security patch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That reluctance probably stems from the fact that CVE-2025-9491/ZDI-CAN-25373 would be difficult to patch without breaking legacy applications that depend on its current design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On November 1, the day after this article was first published, Microsoft released an &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/advisory/ADV25258226" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advisory notice on Windows LNK file UI behavior&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the company reiterated that it does not consider this a vulnerability. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advisory noted that .lnk files cannot be delivered via browser unless packaged in a .zip file that is then opened by the user. “Attempting to open a .lnk file downloaded from the Internet automatically triggers a security warning advising users not to open files from unknown sources, and we strongly recommend heeding this warning,” Microsoft said in the advisory. “Double-clicking on a .lnk file produces a warning stating that the file format is not trusted; a victim must click through this prompt,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Due to the user interaction involved and the fact that the system already warns users that this format is untrusted, Microsoft does not consider this a vulnerability” it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation"&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a patch, organizations worried about .LNK attacks should consider blocking .LNK files or disabling their execution in Windows Explorer, Arctic Wolf advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This should be put in place across all Windows systems, prioritizing endpoints used by personnel with access to sensitive diplomatic or policy information. While this vulnerability was disclosed in March 2025, adoption by threat actors within months of disclosure necessitates urgent monitoring and countermeasures,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations could also block the command and control (C2) domains used by attackers, although these will change over time. In addition, Arctic Wolf recommends that IT teams search for the presence of Canon printer assistant utilities such as &lt;em&gt;cnmpaui.exe&lt;/em&gt;, which are part of the campaign’s exploit chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “The breadth of targeting across multiple European nations within a condensed timeframe suggests either a large-scale coordinated intelligence collection operation or deployment of multiple parallel operational teams with shared tooling but independent targeting,” Arctic Wolf noted, adding that the fact that UNC6384 had jumped on the flaw so quickly since it was made public earlier in 2025 suggested that the group had access to advanced capabilities and resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not as if attacks exploiting Windows shortcut files in different ways are terribly new or innovative. During 2025, they’ve been abused in different ways by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3987073/after-helping-russia-on-the-ground-north-korea-targets-ukraine-with-cyberespionage.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russian cyber-campaigns&lt;/a&gt; against Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3986671/stealth-rat-uses-a-powershell-loader-for-fileless-attacks.html" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese attacks&lt;/a&gt; using the Remcos RAT, and to target companies in the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3837964/polyglot-files-used-to-spread-new-backdoor.html" target="_blank"&gt;United Arab Emirates (UAE)&lt;/a&gt;. In June the technique was used to hide payloads in attacks abusing the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009636/phishing-campaign-abuses-cloudflare-tunnels-to-sneak-malware-past-firewalls.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloudflare Tunnel service&lt;/a&gt;. The issue is really that this type of flaw, which exploits an otherwise useful feature, is simply difficult to patch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was updated on November 6 with information about a new advisory notice from Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the world faced COVID-19, I watched something remarkable happen. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which I had once viewed as tools of research and efficiency, suddenly became instruments of survival. They modelled outbreaks, predicted surges and accelerated vaccine research. Yet at the same time, I witnessed another silent battle unfold a digital one. Health organizations, research institutions and even vaccine supply chains became targets of cyberattacks. For me, it was a turning point that reinforced a simple truth: AI cannot strengthen public health without cybersecurity at its core&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, working at the intersection of data, AI and cloud security for healthcare and life sciences organizations, I’ve seen how transformative intelligent systems can be. But I’ve also seen how fragile they are when trust, data integrity and governance are not built into their foundation. Today, as countries prepare for future pandemics, we must treat cybersecurity not as a support function but as a critical enabler of readiness.  The success of future pandemic preparedness will depend on whether we build trustworthy, secure and ethical AI systems from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-expanding-digital-frontline"&gt;The expanding digital frontline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI-driven pandemic preparedness depends on vast data ecosystems from genomic sequencing labs and hospital networks to connected sensors that monitor population health trends. These systems exchange millions of data points each hour, enabling faster decisions. But every connected device, every model training pipeline and every data integration point expands the attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one of my engagements, public health models were trained using de-identified patient data, IoT feeds and cloud-based analytics. The security challenge was immediate: multiple entry points, distributed teams and differing compliance standards. In such ecosystems, a small misconfiguration an unsecured API or an outdated firmware could expose entire datasets. During the pandemic, these vulnerabilities were exploited at scale. Cybercriminals targeted vaccine research, contact tracing platforms and national health dashboards. It became clear that pandemic preparedness now has a digital dimension as critical as epidemiological preparedness itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-unique-vulnerabilities-of-ai-systems"&gt;The unique vulnerabilities of AI systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional security frameworks are not enough for AI. Attacks on algorithms take subtler forms. I often explain to my clients that when you corrupt data, you corrupt intelligence. Data poisoning occurs when malicious data is inserted into the training process, teaching the AI to make wrong decisions later. Imagine an outbreak prediction model fed with falsified data that underestimates transmission in one region, this could delay interventions and cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another subtle but dangerous threat is model inversion, where attackers reverse-engineer AI outputs to infer private information about patients or study participants. In healthcare, this isn’t just a technical issue, it’s an ethical one. People trust that their health data will never re-identify them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then there are adversarial attacks carefully crafted manipulations that cause AI models to misclassify or ignore patterns. A small perturbation in sensor data could make an outbreak detection algorithm miss early warning signals. These are not theoretical risks, they are realities that cybersecurity teams are already mitigating daily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="designing-trustworthy-ai-ecosystems"&gt;Designing trustworthy AI ecosystems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The systems I help design today for pharmaceutical analytics or public health modeling follow one guiding principle: security by design, not as an afterthought. This begins with a zero-trust architecture assuming every connection, user or system could be compromised until proven otherwise. Role-based access controls, network segmentation and identity verification are now foundational practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also emphasize data provenance, maintaining a traceable chain of custody for every piece of data that enters or leaves a pipeline. This allows us to validate sources, detect tampering and maintain confidence in the insights AI produces. Encryption (both at rest and in transit) is standard, but we also implement differential privacy and homomorphic encryption when dealing with highly sensitive medical or genomic data. These methods allow analysis without exposing personal details an elegant balance between innovation and ethics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model governance is another pillar. Every AI model must have version control, validation sandboxes and rollback capabilities. Before any deployment, we simulate possible adversarial attacks and test recovery procedures. I’ve learned that cybersecurity in AI is not just about defense; it’s about resilience, the ability to detect, isolate and recover without losing functionality during crises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ethics-governance-and-the-elements-of-human-trust"&gt;Ethics, governance and the elements of human trust&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology alone cannot protect public health. Trust is built through ethics and transparency. I often remind data teams that behind every dataset lies a patient, a family or a community. In pandemic situations, public trust determines whether people comply with digital contact tracing, share health information or follow AI-guided advisories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why ethical governance must go hand-in-hand with cybersecurity. AI systems should be explainable, auditable and accountable. Stakeholders from governments to citizens deserve to know how models make decisions, how data is protected and who has access. Regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR and emerging AI governance frameworks are not hurdles; they are guardrails that preserve integrity in moments of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;International cooperation also plays a defining role. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/ehealth/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WHO’s Global Strategy on Digital Health&lt;/a&gt; calls for digital solidarity, while the &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST AI Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt; offers a structured approach to assessing and mitigating AI-related risks. Aligning with these standards helps harmonize cybersecurity practices across borders a necessity, since pandemics and cyber threats recognize none.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lessons-from-the-pandemic-era-cybersecurity-as-preparedness"&gt;Lessons from the pandemic era: Cybersecurity as preparedness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 was a wake-up call in more ways than one. Alongside the biological virus, we faced a wave of ransomware, phishing and misinformation attacks that disrupted hospitals and vaccine logistics. I remember reviewing security reports where health data breaches increased by nearly 50% in the early months of 2021. Those of us working on cloud architecture and analytics pipelines suddenly had to think beyond performance, we had to think about resilience under attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experience reshaped my approach to digital health. We now conduct joint drills between epidemiology teams and cybersecurity engineers, simulating not only outbreak scenarios but also cyber incidents. This multidisciplinary collaboration ensures that both biological and digital emergencies are met with preparedness, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts at the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/covid-19-pandemic-teaches-us-about-cybersecurity-cyberattack-cyber-pandemic-risk-virus/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; describe the growing risk of a “cyber pandemic,” where digital contagion spreads faster than any biological one. I share this concern. Our increasing dependence on AI-based systems means a well-coordinated cyberattack could paralyze response operations during an actual health emergency. It is not enough to develop smart systems; we must make them secure and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="moving-forward-the-road-ahead-security-by-intelligence"&gt;Moving forward: The road ahead – security by intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, I believe the next phase of pandemic preparedness must embrace a security-by-intelligence mindset where AI protects itself using AI. Machine learning can detect anomalies, identify suspicious access patterns and predict potential vulnerabilities before exploitation. We are beginning to see cybersecurity evolve from a reactive function into an intelligent, adaptive shield for public health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Training healthcare professionals to recognize phishing attempts, securing endpoint devices and conducting cyber hygiene education must become as routine as infection-control drills. Every clinician, data engineer and policymaker has a role to play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My advice to organizations embarking on digital health transformation is simple: embed cybersecurity from day one. Treat your data pipeline as a clinical asset, it deserves the same rigor as a vaccine trial or a diagnostic protocol. The systems that save lives must be resilient against those who would exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-as-the-true-measure-of-readiness"&gt;Resilience as the true measure of readiness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pandemic preparedness in the age of AI is no longer about who develops the fastest algorithm but who builds the most trustworthy ecosystem. As a data and cybersecurity architect in healthcare, I have witnessed that true innovation lies in resilience systems that continue to protect and perform even when threatened.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next global health emergency will test not only our biological defences but also our digital fortifications. To succeed, cybersecurity must evolve from being a compliance checkbox to becoming the moral and operational foundation of digital health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the next outbreak comes and it will, our response must be dual: biological immunity and digital integrity. The AI that protects humanity must never be turned against it. That is the essence of preparedness — and the promise of a safer, smarter and more secure future for global health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
