      <title>Chinese hackers target Western diplomats using hard-to-patch Windows shortcut flaw</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4082701/chinese-hackers-target-western-diplomats-using-hard-to-patch-windows-shortcut-flaw.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chinese hackers have been spotted targeting European diplomats using a longstanding Windows shortcut vulnerability that’s been popular with threat groups as far back as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to security company &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/unc6384-weaponizes-zdi-can-25373-vulnerability-to-deploy-plugx/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arctic Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, whose researchers uncovered the latest campaign, the latest attacks saw spear phishing emails sent to officials working for the governments of Hungary, Belgium, Serbia, Italy, and The Netherlands during September and October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government-operated group suspected of being behind the campaign is named UNC6384 by the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG). The same group is believed to have targeted diplomats of several Asian countries earlier in 2025, which might give the impression that UNC6384 is a recently discovered threat actor, hence its UNC (“uncategorized”) status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Arctic Wolf said it believed the group’s tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) strongly resemble those of a known Chinese threat group, “Mustang Panda,” which has been around since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, this looks like just another Chinese cyber-espionage campaign against foreign governments. But there is a deeper story: the Windows vulnerability used in the campaign, which Microsoft has so far been unwilling – or unable – to patch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ghost-flaw"&gt;Ghost flaw&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Arctic Wolf, the latest campaign used spear phishing emails with diplomatic themes to lure targets into executing malicious Windows .LNK shortcut files. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Windows UI parsing that allows command-line instructions to be hidden in &lt;a href="https://detection.fyi/sigmahq/sigma/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_susp_lnk_exec_hidden_cmd/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;.LNK format whitespace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows the attackers to launch a sequence of malicious actions while displaying a decoy PDF showing the agenda for a genuine European Commission meeting scheduled to have been held in Brussels on September 26. The result is the deployment of the PlugX remote access Trojan, which has been popular since 2008 as a tool for opening backdoors into Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trend Micro told Microsoft about the weakness in September 2024, after which it was given a &lt;a href="https://cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9491" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-9491&lt;/a&gt; identifier. However, it turns out that the company’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) had noticed the same issue in 2017, when it was given a separate internal ‘candidate’ identifier, &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ZDI-CAN-25373&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The vulnerability has been exploited by state-sponsored APT groups from North Korea, Iran, Russia, and China,” said Trend Micro in a &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2018 blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite there being a formal CVE, Microsoft appears reluctant to address the issue. As Trend Micro noted in a more recent blog from 2025, “We submitted a proof-of-concept exploit through Trend ZDI’s bug bounty program to Microsoft, who declined to address this vulnerability with a security patch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That reluctance probably stems from the fact that CVE-2025-9491/ZDI-CAN-25373 would be difficult to patch without breaking legacy applications that depend on its current design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation"&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a patch, organizations worried about .LNK attacks should consider blocking .LNK files or disabling their execution in Windows Explorer, Arctic Wolf advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This should be put in place across all Windows systems, prioritizing endpoints used by personnel with access to sensitive diplomatic or policy information. While this vulnerability was disclosed in March 2025, adoption by threat actors within months of disclosure necessitates urgent monitoring and countermeasures,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations could also block the command and control (C2) domains used by attackers, although these will change over time. In addition, Arctic Wolf recommends that IT teams search for the presence of Canon printer assistant utilities such as &lt;em&gt;cnmpaui.exe&lt;/em&gt;, which are part of the campaign’s exploit chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “The breadth of targeting across multiple European nations within a condensed timeframe suggests either a large-scale coordinated intelligence collection operation or deployment of multiple parallel operational teams with shared tooling but independent targeting,” Arctic Wolf noted, adding that the fact that UNC6384 had jumped on the flaw so quickly since it was made public earlier in 2025 suggested that the group had access to advanced capabilities and resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not as if attacks exploiting Windows shortcut files in different ways are terribly new or innovative. During 2025, they’ve been abused in different ways by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3987073/after-helping-russia-on-the-ground-north-korea-targets-ukraine-with-cyberespionage.html" target="_blank"&gt;Russian cyber-campaigns&lt;/a&gt; against Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3986671/stealth-rat-uses-a-powershell-loader-for-fileless-attacks.html" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese attacks&lt;/a&gt; using the Remcos RAT, and to target companies in the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3837964/polyglot-files-used-to-spread-new-backdoor.html" target="_blank"&gt;United Arab Emirates (UAE)&lt;/a&gt;. In June the technique was used to hide payloads in attacks abusing the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009636/phishing-campaign-abuses-cloudflare-tunnels-to-sneak-malware-past-firewalls.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloudflare Tunnel service&lt;/a&gt;. The issue is really that this type of flaw, which exploits an otherwise useful feature, is simply difficult to patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Alleged Jabber Zeus Coder ‘MrICQ’ in U.S. Custody</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/alleged-jabber-zeus-coder-mricq-in-u-s-custody/</link>
      <description>A Ukrainian man indicted in 2012 for conspiring with a prolific hacking group to steal tens of millions of dollars from U.S. businesses was arrested in Italy and is now in custody in the United States, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.

Sources close to the investigation say Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov, a 41-year-old from the Russia-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine, was previously referenced in U.S. federal charging documents only by his online handle "MrICQ." According to a 13-year-old indictment filed by prosecutors in Nebraska, MrICQ was a developer for a cybercrime group known as "Jabber Zeus."</description>

      <description>The criminal use of cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly professionalised, but so too is the global response. Participants at the 9th Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptoassets emphasised three priorities: developing common standards, deepening cooperation and investing in capacity. These are essential if authorities and industry are to keep pace with evolving threats and recover illicit cryptoassets at scale.</description>

      <title>Fake number, real damage: Europol urges action against caller ID spoofing</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/fake-number-real-damage-europol-urges-action-against-caller-id-spoofing</link>
      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>What does aligning security to the business really mean?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080670/what-does-aligning-security-to-the-business-really-mean.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of his company’s AI center of excellence, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timsattler/?originalSubdomain=de"&gt;Tim Sattler&lt;/a&gt; works to identify where and how the technology can provide measurable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re discussing opportunities,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That Jungheinrich AG’s AI team is doing so is hardly remarkable. What’s notable is that Sattler, CISO for the German manufacturer of warehouse equipment and tech solutions, is part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a role security chiefs don’t typically play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sattler sees his membership in the AI center of excellence as evidence that he and his security team are in lockstep with the business and its strategic vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I see my role as not only seeing all the risks but also all the opportunities that AI presents. So I get out of the risk corner and really see the big picture,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He took the same approach when ChatGPT arrived, at which time he and his team did a deep dive into large language models “to figure out how the technology worked, to understand the risks, and the new business opportunities it would create so we could say, ‘Here are the rules; here’s how you can try it out and play around with it.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And he’s doing much the same with quantum computing, explaining that board members have sought out his and his security staffers’ opinions on the technology and its potential, not just its &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3552701/the-cisos-guide-to-establishing-quantum-resilience.html"&gt;cybersecurity implications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They knew we were the right people to talk to first about quantum because we have proven that we see ourselves in this advisory role,” Sattler says. “Very often the business [unit leader] only sees opportunities, and external advisers may be very sales-driven, so both may not be very objective. But we [in security] have a neutral position, seeing the risks and rewards. This is now the role of the CISO and the security organization.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sattler says serving in such a capacity demonstrates that security and the business are aligned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Alignment to me means that information security supports the strategy of the organization,” says Sattler, who also serves as a board director with the governance association ISACA. “That means we know what the goals of the organization are, what the company wants to achieve, we understand the business environment, what the competition is doing, what the trends are in the industry. Those are all things security needs to know to support innovation and growth and to support the organization in achieving its goals. And that means security can’t just focus on risk. We also need to see the opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="alignment-a-security-department-imperative"&gt;Alignment: A security department imperative&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of alignment is big in security today. A single internet search proves as much, producing countless results that contain some variation of “security-business alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet research shows that many CISOs aren’t in sync with the rest of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consulting/how-can-cybersecurity-go-beyond-value-protection-to-value-creation"&gt;2025 EY Global Cybersecurity Leadership Insights Study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, shows that only 13% of CISOs “were consulted early when urgent strategic decisions were being made” and “58% of CISOs and cybersecurity executives say it is difficult to articulate their value beyond risk mitigation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/newsroom/press-releases/2025/splunk-report-cisos-gain-influence-in-the-c-suite-and-boardrooms-worldwide.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Splunk 2025 CISO Report&lt;/a&gt; found gaps between how CISOs and boards perceive priorities. For example, the report found that 52% of surveyed board members think CISOs spend most of their time on business enablement but only 34% of CISOs agreed that that was the case. And 55% of board members said business acumen was a highly valuable skill for CISOs, but only 40% of CISOs ranked it as a skill they should develop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given such disconnects, it’s worth asking: What does aligning security to the business really mean? Why is it important? And what are strategies that CISOs can use to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If CISOs want to successfully align security with their business, they need to make alignment more than a mantra, says &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/experts/katell-thielemann"&gt;Katell Thielemann&lt;/a&gt;, distinguished vice president analyst at research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough to say it; you actually have to do it,” she explains. “There is a contingent of cybersecurity that sees itself as an island, implementing defense in depth in every corner of the organization, adopting all these frameworks and standards, but there is diminishing returns in doing that. So instead of saying, ‘This is our cybersecurity discipline and we’re doing all these things because the benchmarks tell us to,’ CISOs have to align their efforts to their organization’s business model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="indicators-of-alignment"&gt;Indicators of alignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One barometer of security-business alignment in action, Thielemann says, is when security teams engage with the business and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3979024/the-8-security-metrics-that-matter-most.html"&gt;use business metrics to determine security’s effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an example, she points to the partnership between security and engineering at a manufacturing plant that had devices using software no longer supported by the vendor. The two teams worked together to implement needed security measures, such as segmentation, that wouldn’t interfere with operations but added the necessary security. Knowing to schedule security work during plant downtime further demonstrated the alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s showing security knows the business and is not just doing cybersecurity as a discipline,” Thielemann says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To align, she says, security leaders must “know the objectives the business has and use those to shape strategy, whether it’s cost containment, going into new markets, adopting cloud. The playbook starts from understanding the organizational priorities and then layering in what threat actors are doing in that industry and what could go wrong, what is the risk we can live with, and understanding and articulating the business impact of security incidents.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/ayan-roy"&gt;Ayan Roy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Americas cybersecurity competency leader at professional services firm EY, cites another example of alignment involving one company acquiring another as part of a strategy to enter new markets. The company’s CISO, knowing that building trust with customers was critical to growth post-merger, devised a strategy to strengthen the acquired company’s security to the levels necessary to ensure successful integration, corporate expansion, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Rob%20T.%20Lee"&gt;Robert T. Lee&lt;/a&gt;, chief AI officer and chief of research at security training and certification firm SANS, says alignment can also be seen in other ways, such as when and how security works with the business. For example, CISOs who recognize the need to boost security while reducing friction often have their security departments work with business units at the earliest stages of initiatives. Security teams integrated into R&amp;amp;D units so “they’re able to deploy things with much more or a trust model” is another sign of alignment, Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Alignment in all of information security really focuses on the idea of supporting operations. It’s about risk management with an emphasis on enabling operations,” says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.linkedin.com_in_jamesjaurez_&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=qwHaVVscXk_NBWd7DQFk0g&amp;amp;r=L0JdBfO3GPsCEs_j1venmQ&amp;amp;m=fEB7A6mijDdSaPpFqRNQf_JjhIIGQDDY5E6XtppQ4jOUnQzj2121QZDVNBCTkVgR&amp;amp;s=kZJ-nZzFIrfkb2-bTnF95Ik7WoWxPaBsuJph6kjwqzw&amp;amp;e="&gt;Dr. James Jaurez&lt;/a&gt;, National University’s department chair of cybersecurity and technology&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there is value in security-business alignment. According to the 2025 EY Global Cybersecurity Leadership Insights Study, “cybersecurity contributes 11% to 20%, or a median of US$36M, in value to each enterprise-wide strategic initiative it is involved in.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lack-of-alignment-persists-for-many"&gt;Lack of alignment persists for many&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, as the EY study found, alignment exists in a fraction of organizations. And as Jaurez says, just as there are indicators of security-business alignment, there are signs when it’s absent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One indicator, he says, is being “over secure,” where the costs of the security measures and the friction they introduce into the organization’s work processes and operations exceed the value they provide. Another is when security leaders don’t know or can’t articulate the organization’s vision or strategic goals, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others point to security feeling left out or brought into initiatives after they’re under way as indicators that alignment is missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When security is not aligned, security is reacting to changes rather than shaping changes,” says &lt;a href="(35)%20Matt%20G.%20%7C%20LinkedIn"&gt;Matt Gorham&lt;/a&gt;, leader of PwC’s Cyber and Risk Innovation Institute. “But when security isn’t chasing the business it’s because it’s at the table from the beginning and is saying, ‘Here’s how I can help the business grow and grow securely.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
