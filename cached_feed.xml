      <title>New Shai-Hulud worm spreading through npm, GitHub</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095578/new-shai-hulud-worm-spreading-through-npm-github.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new version of the Shai-Hulud credentials-stealing self-propagating worm is expanding through the open npm registry, a threat that developers who download packages from the repository have to deal with immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-2-0-ongoing-supply-chain-attack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at Wiz Inc. said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that in the early stages of the campaign late last week,&lt;sup&gt;  &lt;/sup&gt;a thousand new GitHub repositories containing harvested victim data were being added every 30 minutes. &lt;a href="https://research.jfrog.com/post/shai-hulud-the-second-coming/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;And researchers at JFrog identified 181 compromised packages.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current campaign introduces a new variant, which Wiz researchers dub Shai-Hulud 2.0, that executes malicious code during the preinstall phase, “significantly increasing potential exposure in build and runtime environments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat leverages compromised package maintainer accounts to publish trojanized versions of legitimate npm packages. Once installed, the malware exfiltrates developer and CI/CD secrets to GitHub repositories, and also inserts the malicious payload into all of the users’ available npm packages. Threat actors could also use the exfiltrated secrets to break into and install more malware in victims’ IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JFrog said this new variant generates randomized repository names for exfiltration, making it harder for security teams to hunt down and scrub the leaked secrets. JFrog also said the new payload contains new functionality, including privilege escalation, DNS hijacking, and the ability to delete data from the victim’s machine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple popular packages used by developers, including those from Zapier, ENS Domains, PostHog, and Postman, have been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/another-shai-hulud-npm-worm-is-spreading-heres-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at ReversingLabs also noted &lt;/a&gt;the list of compromised packages includes AsyncAPI related packages, including &lt;a href="https://secure.software/npm/packages/@asyncapi/specs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@asyncapi/specs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has had more than 100 million lifetime downloads and an average of 1.4 million weekly downloads. This package in particular is also believed to be the ‘patient-zero’, or the first known infected package, for this wave of attack, the researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="second-wave-is-bigger-and-faster"&gt;Second wave is bigger and faster&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers and security teams looking for indicators of compromise should note that the new variant adds two new payload files: &lt;em&gt;setup_bun.js&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bun_environment.js&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The re-emergence of the worm indicates that this remains a current and serious threat to the npm ecosystem,” said &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute. “CSOs must address this threat by monitoring the components used in their software and hardening their CI/CD pipelines to increase resilience in the event that malicious code is executed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4058059/warning-hackers-have-inserted-credential-stealing-code-into-some-npm-libraries.html" target="_blank"&gt;first emerged in September&lt;/a&gt;, revealed by the discovery that dozens of npm libraries, including a color library with over 2 million downloads a week, had been replaced with malicious versions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial Shai-Hulud wave was already one of the most severe JavaScript supply-chain attacks Wiz has seen, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/merav-bar-608351232/?originalSubdomain=il" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Merav Bar&lt;/a&gt;, a company threat researcher and co-author of the report told &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt;. “This new wave is bigger and faster: more than 25,000 attacker-created repos across roughly 350 GitHub users, growing by about 1,000 repos every 30 minutes, with malware that steals developer and cloud credentials and runs in the preinstall phase, touching dev machines and CI/CD pipelines alike. That combination of scale, speed, and access makes it a high-impact campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="assume-compromise"&gt;Assume compromise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an individual had pulled any of the affected packages during the November 21–23 window, she said, they should assume their environment is exposed. Remedies include clearing the npm cache on their workstation, removing &lt;em&gt;node_modules&lt;/em&gt;, reinstalling from clean versions, or pinning to versions published before the malicious releases, and rotating any tokens or secrets that were present (GitHub PATs, npm tokens, SSH keys, cloud credentials).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enabling strong MFA on GitHub/npm and watching for unexpected new repos or workflow files in the developer’s personal account is also critical, she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shai-Hulud’s second wave isn’t surprising, said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-laporte/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brad LaPorte&lt;/a&gt;, cybersecurity advisor at Morphisec. “The first attack showed how easily preinstall scripts could be weaponized. This wave proves what happens when those warnings aren’t acted on: larger scale, more destructive payloads, and automation that infects thousands of repositories in hours.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations-for-repositories"&gt;Recommendations for repositories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To stop attackers from easily uploading malicious packages, npm needs to tighten its publishing process, LaPorte said, including ensuring the identity of new accounts is verified before they are allowed to publish packages; implementing rate limits to prevent attackers from uploading multiple malicious packages in a short period and monitoring package maintainers for suspicious activity such as sudden spikes in publishing or packages with significant unexplained changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From what we’ve observed in the Shai-Hulud incidents,” said Bar of Wiz, “the core issue isn’t npm specifically. It’s that open-source registries now function as high-impact distribution hubs, and attackers are taking advantage of how much trust developers place in them. In that context, the most important thing is continuing to strengthen the guardrails around how packages are published and updated. That includes making it harder for compromised maintainer accounts to push malicious versions, increasing visibility into unusual publishing behavior, and helping downstream users quickly understand when a package version may be unsafe. Those are ecosystem-level defenses rather than criticisms of any single registry, but they reflect the direction the entire open-source community will need to move as attacks like Shai-Hulud become more automated and far-reaching.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ensar Seker, CISO at SOCRadar, cautioned that Shai‑Hulud isn’t what he called typical package compromise. “It’s a worm embedded into the dev supply chain. It signals that attackers are shifting from targeting compiled binaries and runtime environments toward the very processes developers use to build and ship software. No organization should assume, ‘We don’t use npm, so we’re safe’, because even downstream dependencies or dev toolchains can become the launch pad.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far npm has focused on ensuring that package authors are properly authenticated and that packages are not altered after being published, said Ullrich of the SANS Institute. But, he added, this does not prevent a malicious actor from publishing malicious packages. Recently, npm further restricted the default access token lifetimes and started to revoke legacy ‘classic tokens,’ he acknowledged. “npm may need to implement some form of automated scanning for obvious malicious content, but it will be difficult to implement a meaningful solution.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations-for-security-teams-developers"&gt;Recommendations for security teams, developers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wiz says security teams in organizations with application developer teams that use npm – and individual developers using npm and GitHub – should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clear each developer’s npm cache;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;pin dependencies to known clean versions or roll back to pre-November 21 builds;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;revoke and regenerate npm tokens, GitHub PATs, SSH keys and cloud provider credentials;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;enforce phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for developer and CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery) accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within GitHub and CI/CD environments, they should search for newly-created repositories with ‘Shai-Hulud’ in the description, review unauthorized workflows or suspicious commits referencing hulud, and monitor for new npm publishes under their organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For long-term protection CSOs and IT leaders are urged to restrict or disable lifecycle scripts (postinstall, preinstall) in CI/CD environments, limit outbound network access from built systems to trusted domains only, and make sure developers use only short-lived, scoped automation login tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Eine wachsende Zahl von Unternehmen setzt inzwischen auf eine &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/a/4008348" target="_blank"&gt;Multicloud-Strategie&lt;/a&gt; – in erster Linie, um Workloads genau dort auszuführen, wo es für den jeweiligen Anwendungsfall am günstigsten ist. Und zwar ohne zusätzliche Komplexitäten zu schaffen. Das kann diverse Vorteile realisieren, zum Beispiel in Zusammenhang mit Compliance und Verfügbarkeit. Multicloud-Initiativen können jedoch auch neue Sicherheitslücken entstehen lassen, die diese Benefits im Handumdrehen wieder zunichte machen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicherheit in Multicloud-Umgebungen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495736/cloud-security-strategie-in-die-cloud-aber-mit-sicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;zu gewährleisten&lt;/a&gt;, ist unabhängig von der Unternehmensgröße eine nicht zu unterschätzende Herausforderung. Glücklicherweise können einige relativ simple Methoden und Best Practices dazu beitragen, Angreifer fernzuhalten und Cloud-übergreifend eine sichere, widerstandsfähige Infrastruktur aufzubauen. Welche das sind, haben wir im Gespräch mit einigen Sicherheitsexperten herausgearbeitet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-zentrale-autoritat-aufbauen"&gt;1. Zentrale Autorität aufbauen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT-Sicherheit liegt bekanntlich in der Verantwortung der gesamten Belegschaft. Dennoch macht es Sinn, ein zentrales Team (oder eine zentrale Rolle) einzurichten, das die Übersicht über sämtliche Security-Angelegenheiten wahrt – und diese strategisch steuert. Dieser Überzeugung ist auch &lt;a href="https://www.securitycompass.com/about-us/trevor-young/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Trevor Young&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Product Officer beim Sicherheitsdienstleister Security Compass: “Dieses Team beziehungsweise diese Rolle sollte koordinieren und eng mit Anwendungs-Teams und Cloud-Ownern zusammenarbeiten.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die zentrale Autorität in Sachen IT-Sicherheit ist dafür zuständig:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eine umfassende Sicherheitsstrategie zu definieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;einheitliche Richtlinien und Standards einzuziehen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cloud-übergreifende Security-Tools auszuwählen und zu managen, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Compliance in sämtlichen Cloud-Umgebungen sicherzustellen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-einheitliche-governance-etablieren"&gt;2. Einheitliche Governance etablieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein einheitliches Security-Governance-Modell, das alle Cloud-Umgebungen umfasst und durch zentralisiertes &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2763035/was-sie-ueber-iam-wissen-muessen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Identity Management&lt;/a&gt;, Automatisierung und Policy Enforcement unterstützt wird, ist mit Blick auf Multicloud-Umgebungen ebenfalls ratsam.  Nigel Gibbons, Director und Senior Advisor beim Sicherheitsdienstleister NCC Group, outet sich als Anhänger dieses Ansatzes und fasst seine Vorteile zusammen: “Das kann Komplexität reduzieren und Silos auflösen. Zudem reduziert es blinde Flecken, setzt das Least-Privilege-Prinzip durch, ermöglicht es, Bedrohungen in Echtzeit zu erkennen und optimiert die Compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Risiken über sämtliche Clouds hinweg zuverlässig zu erfassen, empfiehlt Gibbons CISOs und ihren Teams, sich eng mit DevOps-, Plattform- und Compliance-Teams abzustimmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-scope-erweitern"&gt;3. Scope erweitern&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Sie nur auf eine Cloud setzen, liegt der Fokus meist auf dessen spezifischen Security-Tools und -Services – die Sie im Laufe der Zeit vermutlich immer besser durchdringen. Sind Sie dagegen in mehreren Clouds unterwegs, steigt das Komplexitätslevel drastisch. Denn dann gilt es nicht nur, sich mit mehreren, proprietären Sicherheitsmodellen, Diensten und Terminologien auseinanderzusetzen, wie Security-Compass-Experte Young festhält: “Man kann sich nicht einfach auf die nativen Tools eines Cloud-Anbieters verlassen und erwarten, dass diese alle wichtigen Aspekte abdecken. Eine Multicloud-Umgebung erfordert eine breitere, herstellerunabhängige Strategie.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut dem Experten müssen Anwender, die die Security-Tools der einzelnen Cloud-Anbieter ohne einheitliche Strategie einsetzen, mit zahlreichen Problemen rechnen – beispielweise:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inkonsistenten Richtlinien,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Lücken in der Abdeckung oder&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Security-Events, die sich nicht Cloud-übergreifend korrelieren lassen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Das ist, als hätte man diverse verschiedene Wachleute, die nicht miteinander kommunizieren, aber verschiedene Teile desselben Gebäudes &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493920/10-essenzielle-masnahmen-fur-physische-sicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;bewachen sollen&lt;/a&gt;. Es kommt zwangsläufig zu Sicherheitslücken”, stellt Young in Aussicht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-trust-boundary-konstruieren"&gt;4. Trust Boundary konstruieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hören Sie ganz generell auf damit, in Clouds zu denken”, empfiehlt  &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevetcherchian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Tcherchian&lt;/a&gt;, CISO beim Sicherheitsanbieter XYPRO, und erklärt: “Behandeln Sie jede Umgebung – egal ob AWS, Azure, On-Prem oder Legacy-Mainframe – als Teil einer singulären, einheitlichen Trust Boundary und richten Sie Kontrollmaßnahmen rund um Identitäten, Datenflüsse und Kontexte ein – nicht um Plattformen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anwender, die ihre Sicherheitsstrategie “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492887/aws-google-und-azure-im-vergleich-welcher-hyperscaler-ist-der-sicherste.html" target="_blank"&gt;pro Cloud&lt;/a&gt;” konzipierten, hätten damit bereits ihre Kontrollmöglichkeiten fragmentiert und dürften sich schwertun, das wieder zu bereinigen, ist der CISO überzeugt: “Mit Clouds verhält es sich ein bisschen wie mit Klempnerarbeit: Sicherheitsentscheider und -teams, die zu stark auf Cloud-native Tools fixiert sind, improvisieren am Ende oft abenteuerliche Lösungen, die nicht wirklich zusammenpassen und zeitnah lecken.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-verantwortung-ubernehmen"&gt;5. Verantwortung übernehmen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obwohl Multicloud-Security nicht nur Sicherheitsentscheider angeht, ist &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/ensar-seker/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ensar Seker&lt;/a&gt;, CISO beim Threat-Intelligence-Spezialisten SOCRadar, davon überzeugt, dass seiner Berufsgattung am Ende des Tages der wesentliche Teil der Accountability zuteil werden sollte: “Letztendlich muss der CISO sicherstellen, dass Technologie-unabhängige Sicherheitsrichtlinien auf- sowie konsequent durchgesetzt werden und mit der Risikotoleranz des Unternehmens in Einklang stehen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dabei sei insbesondere entscheidend, Silos zwischen Teams aufzubrechen und sicherzustellen, dass die Cloud-übergreifende Transparenz unter einer einheitlichen SecOps-Funktion zentralisiert ist, so Seker. “Multicloud ist nicht nur eine Technologiestrategie, sondern sichert auch betriebliche Resilienz. Anwender sollten in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3994110/threat-intelligence-plattformen-ein-kaufratgeber.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud-Bedrohungsinformationen&lt;/a&gt; investieren, die übergreifende Angriffsmuster widerspiegeln. Zudem empfiehlt sich der Einsatz von  Laufzeitüberwachung und Policy Drift Detection, um kontinuierliche Sicherheit zu gewährleisten.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-kollaborative-management-umgebung-fordern"&gt;6. Kollaborative Management-Umgebung fördern&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effektives Security-Management erfordert auch, dass Sicherheitsteams und andere &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2801444/so-bringen-sie-it-und-fachabteilung-unter-einen-hut.html" target="_blank"&gt;wichtige Stakeholder&lt;/a&gt; zusammenwirken. “Nur so lassen sich sämtliche Maßnahmen auf die übergeordneten Business-Ziele abstimmen”, unterstreicht &lt;a href="https://centricconsulting.com/team/brandyn-fisher/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brandyn Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Security Services bei Centric Consulting. Je nach Organisationsstruktur und Komplexität des Anwenderunternehmens umfasse diese Zusammenarbeit in der Regel Lösungsarchitekten, Cloud-Spezialisten und Systemadministratoren, so Fisher. Er fügt hinzu: “Der effektivste Ansatz ist eine klare Aufteilung der Verantwortlichkeiten.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In der Regel definiere das Sicherheitsteam die Anforderungen und Governance-Rahmenbedingungen, während die Umsetzung ein technisches Team übernehme, so der Chefberater. “Dieser ausgewogene Ansatz schafft klare Zuständigkeiten und fördert gleichzeitig die funktionsübergreifende Kollaboration, die für ein umfassendes Sicherheitsmanagement in multiplen Cloud-Umgebungen erforderlich ist.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angesichts der rasanten Entwicklung der Cloud-Technologie könne man dabei leicht in Selbstzufriedenheit verfallen, warnt Fisher und rät: “Es ist essenziell, wachsam zu bleiben und proaktiv zu handeln. Sie sollten deshalb die Skills Ihrer Teams im Rahmen von Branchenkonferenzen, Schulungen und der aktiven Beteiligung an Experten-Communities kontinuierlich weiterentwickeln.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-einheitliche-response-strategie-einziehen"&gt;7. Einheitliche Response-Strategie einziehen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine einheitliche, bedrohungszentrische Detection-and-Response-Strategie die in allen Cloud-Umgebungen funktioniert, ist nach Auffassung von &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchem-boles/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mitchem Boles&lt;/a&gt;, Field CISO beim Plattformanbieter Intezer, ein wirksames Mittel, um selbst die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3840232/11-ruinose-ransomware-bedrohungen.html" target="_blank"&gt;raffiniertesten Angreifer&lt;/a&gt; abzuwehren: “Indem sie Warnmeldungen und Verhaltensmuster von AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform und anderen Anbietern in einem zentralisierten System korrelieren, können sich Sicherheitsteams auf echte Bedrohungen fokussieren, statt von Warnmeldungen erschlagen zu werden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So ermögliche dieser Ansatz den Security-Teams, schneller zu reagieren und parallel den manuellen Aufwand für die Triage in komplexen Umgebungen reduzieren, hält Boles fest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-cloud-zugriff-kontrollieren"&gt;8. Cloud-Zugriff kontrollieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geht es nach &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaymesdavis/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jaymes David&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Technology Evangelist beim Digital-Workplace-Anbieter Kasm Technologies, sollte Ihr Fokus vor allem darauf liegen, die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492897/attack-surface-management-losungen-9-tools-um-ihre-angriffsflache-zu-managen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Angriffsfläche&lt;/a&gt; Ihrer Multicloud-Umgebung zu reduzieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Beschränken Sie den Zugriff auf Cloud-Ressourcen durch kurzlebige, isolierte Sitzungen. Das minimiert die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass sich Malware im System halten kann oder sich jemand unbefugt Zugang verschafft. Sitzungsaufzeichnungen, SIEM-Integration, DLP oder Wasserzeichen tragen zu einem starken Sicherheitskonzept bei, das nachverfolgbar, durchsetzbar und überprüfbar ist”, so der Evangelist.

      <title>7 signs your cybersecurity framework needs rebuilding</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094743/7-signs-your-cybersecurity-framework-needs-rebuilding.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity frameworks are the guidelines enterprises use to guard against cyberattacks. The typical framework describes the steps needed to address various cybersecurity risks, detecting latent vulnerabilities, and generally improving the enterprise’s digital defense. Any gaps discovered in the attack surface indicates that immediate steps should be taken to rebuild and strengthen cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/keri-pearlson"&gt;Keri Pearlson&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer and principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, says there are many signs that indicate an existing cybersecurity framework needs attention. “If your cybersecurity framework hasn’t been reviewed in the last two months, if you haven’t been dynamically updating things, or if your team hasn’t yet incorporated AI into your cybersecurity thinking, you need to review and possibly rebuild your framework,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Are you risking enterprise security by relying on an outdated security framework? Here are warning signs that indicate it may be time for a much-need overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-not-having-a-dynamic-process-for-recognizing-changes"&gt;1. Not having a dynamic process for recognizing changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake, Pearlson says, is failing to recognize that the current plan is out of date or simply not working. Breaches happen, but that doesn’t always mean your cyber framework needs rebuilding. It does, however, indicate that the framework needs to be rethought and redesigned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building a cyber-resilient organization requires thinking differently, Pearlson states. The best approach, she suggests, is deploying a dynamic process that watches for changes in the environment and initiates a rebuilding process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The key is to have the right sensing and responding mechanism — which is likely a combination of technology and human activities,” she says, noting that technology can sense change and identify anomalies, and people can evaluate whether the change is a risk that requires attention and investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-experiencing-a-successful-cyberattack-of-any-size"&gt;2. Experiencing a successful cyberattack — of any size&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nothing highlights a weak cybersecurity framework better than a breach, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-bucher-7194057/"&gt;Steven Bucher&lt;/a&gt;, CSO at Mastercard. “I’ve seen firsthand how even a minor incident can reveal outdated protocols or gaps in employee training,” he states. “If your framework hasn’t kept pace with evolving threats or business needs, it’s time for a rebuild.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats are always evolving, so staying proactive with regular reviews and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness will help catch issues before they become crises, Bucher says. “Ultimately, keeping your framework robust and up-to-date is the best way to protect your organization and maintain trust.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-continuous-oversight-becomes-a-challenge"&gt;3. Continuous oversight becomes a challenge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your framework can’t provide continuous oversight, or support proactive risk management, then it’s time to rebuild by aligning with established standards, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework"&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework&lt;/a&gt;, and integrating industry-specific compliance requirements as needed, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidefloyd/"&gt;Dave Floyd&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of cybersecurity sales and service for Hughes Network Systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The best approach to rebuild a cybersecurity framework is to begin with the NIST framework and then overlay it with industry-specific compliance requirements, Floyd advises. This approach ensures that best practices and regulatory obligations for healthcare, financial, and other enterprises are fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-your-formal-framework-review-process-is-measured-in-years"&gt;4. Your formal framework review process is measured in years&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there haven’t been any material changes to your framework in the past three-plus years, it’s a strong indication that your framework may be outdated, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-mcleod-7a6a61b/"&gt;Sandra McLeod&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at Zoom. “The cybersecurity landscape has evolved rapidly, especially with the rise of generative AI — your framework should reflect these shifts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McLeod recommends a complete a biannual framework review combined with a cursory review during the gap years. “This helps to ensure that the framework stays aligned with evolving threats, business changes, and regulatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, security leaders should always have their security framework in mind while maintaining a rough, running list of areas that could be improved, streamlined, or clarified, McLeod suggests. “These informal insights should be brought into discussions during the cursory reviews to keep continuous improvement top of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-youre-continually-chasing-alerts-without-performing-predictive-assessments"&gt;5. You’re continually chasing alerts without performing predictive assessments&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your organization is continually in a reactive state instead of a proactive posture, it’s time to re-evaluate the framework, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimabaiati/"&gt;Nima Baiati&lt;/a&gt;, executive director and general manager of commercial software and security solutions at Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an organization is stuck in a cycle of continually chasing alerts and incidents, as well as reporting events after the fact &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3511388/want-to-get-ahead-four-activities-that-can-enable-a-more-proactive-security-regime.html"&gt;instead of performing predictive threat assessments&lt;/a&gt;, data analysis, and forward planning, it’s time for a change, Baiati advises. “Of course, there will still be some reactive situations, but if they consume most of the bandwidth of daily operations, it’s probably just a matter of time before more significant incidents occur.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Baiati suggests beginning with a solid understanding of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567279/how-to-establish-your-business-s-risk-tolerance.html"&gt;your organization’s risk appetite&lt;/a&gt; and overall business strategy. “Security, when done right, can be a competitive advantage, since it minimizes operational disruption and optimizes trust,” he states. For example, financial institutions have a low appetite for risk and a critical need to protect the integrity of their data and their reputation. Their business strategy and security are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080670/what-does-aligning-security-to-the-business-really-mean.html"&gt;inherently connected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, because team members are more mobile than ever, endpoint security is now a focus for network security and needs to be included in the cybersecurity framework. “To build strong endpoint security, organizations should take a comprehensive, layered approach that safeguards all aspects of their digital environment — firmware, hardware, software, and the supply chain,” Baiati says. “Evaluate both on-device and cloud-based AI applications to ensure effective, real-time threat detection and response.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-kris-and-kpis-are-trending-negatively"&gt;6. KRIs and KPIs are trending negatively&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there’s a sense that key risk indicators (KRIs) and key performance indicators (KPIs) are headed in an unanticipated direction, your framework may need to be re-evaluated, says &lt;a href="https://www.protiviti.com/us-en/sameer-ansari"&gt;Sameer Ansari&lt;/a&gt;, head of the data privacy team lead at audit, risk, and compliance consultancy Protiviti.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations that view their cybersecurity framework as a compliance checklist rather than as a tool to inform proper risk decisions are courting danger, Ansari warns. “Organizations should consider key business objectives and risks that they may face and apply the framework through that lens.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When building or updating a framework, many cybersecurity leaders find themselves caught up in benchmarking or comparing themselves to other firms instead of focusing on what matters to their organization, Ansari says. Worse yet is believing that quantity is more important than quality. “Some cybersecurity chiefs will try to combine several different frameworks, creating an unmanageable ‘Frankenstein framework’ that becomes very hard to manage and sustain,” he warns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-youve-taken-a-compliance-based-approach"&gt;7. You’ve taken a compliance-based approach&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A common mistake many cybersecurity leaders make is designing a framework that’s primarily designed to “pass the audit,” says &lt;a href="https://cypfer.com/team-member/daniel-tobok/"&gt;Daniel Tobok&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of incident response firm CYPFER, instead of targeting business objectives. He cautions that a compliance-only approach often excludes critical input from non-IT stakeholders and typically results in a framework that looks good on paper but fails to deliver meaningful protection in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a cybersecurity framework should evolve continuously, with priority given to the highest-risk areas, Tobok advises. “However, a full rebuild may be necessary when the existing framework no longer protects the organization effectively, or when the cost of incremental fixes outweighs the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He adds that rebuilding is also warranted immediately after a major enterprise shift, such as a change to the business model, an amended regulatory environment, or an extended threat landscape, all of which can make the existing framework outdated or insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>End of the game for cybercrime infrastructure: 1025 servers taken down</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down</link>
      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

      <title>Telecom security reboot: Why zero trust is the only way forward</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095382/telecom-security-reboot-why-zero-trust-is-the-only-way-forward.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telecom networks are everywhere. They keep the world moving — all the way from managing data, powering business, connecting people across continents and whatnot. For a long time, security in this space was pretty straightforward: build a wall, keep threats outside and trust everything inside. Back when networks were locked down and closed, that was enough.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But those days are over. Now, workloads sprawl across hybrid clouds, edge devices multiply and third-party vendors are everywhere. The old perimeter? It’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where zero trust comes in. Not just the latest buzzword, but a must-have survival tool. The problem is, a lot of companies think zero trust is something you can just buy off the shelf. That’s not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The misunderstanding holding telecom back&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Everywhere you look in telecom, “zero trust” pops up — in boardrooms, strategy docs and vendor pitches. But somewhere along the way, people lost sight of what it really means. Too many leaders treat it like a compliance box to tick or another software rollout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The truth’s pretty stark: Zero trust is a mindset. It’s about swapping assumptions for constant proof. When that mindset becomes part of the culture, security finally stops being just another chore and becomes how you operate. But most telcos haven’t made that mental shift. They’re living with a false sense of safety and attackers are taking full advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;IT and OT: Impact is linked&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most OT attacks start in IT environments these days. Once attackers get hold of admin credentials or find a weak interface, they can jump straight into the network gear or base-station controllers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bridging this isn’t about shuffling org charts. It’s about seeing everything at once and building a single rulebook. Shared access policies, clear patch priorities and unified threat detection — when you get all that working together, zero trust finally turns into something real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The real enemies: Persistence and patience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Telecom operators aren’t just up against lone hackers or ransomware gangs anymore. The big threat is patient, well-funded groups — nation-state actors who know how to stay invisible. Attacks like Salt Typhoon have proven these groups can live inside telecom networks for months, quietly stealing data with real geopolitical stakes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA has flagged Volt Typhoon and other China-linked groups for &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;breaking into telecom operators all over the world since 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Building trust where none exists&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero trust isn’t just a tech upgrade — it’s about habits. And three habits matter most: always verify, give only what’s needed and make sure problems can’t spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always verify:&lt;/strong&gt; Logging in isn’t the end of the check. Every person, device and system gets watched — where they’re connecting from, what they’re doing and if it all looks normal.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least privilege:&lt;/strong&gt; The less power someone or something has, the less damage they can do if things go sideways. Tightening that up slashes risk — no fancy new tools required.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segment the network:&lt;/strong&gt; Stop trouble from spreading. Slice networks into smaller, isolated zones — micro-segments. When networks are divided this way, potential breaches can be minimised.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The elephant in the room: legacy tech&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest — legacy infrastructure isn’t going anywhere. Network hardware built decades ago still runs the show, designed for nonstop uptime when trust used to be automatic. Swapping it all out for something new? That’s a massive risk, not to mention wildly expensive. But pretending you can just leave everything as is — that’s worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what actually works? You wrap old systems in modern “security shells.” Think secure gateways, centralized authentication and session monitoring. These layers let you boost security now, without gambling with service outages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero trust isn’t about chasing some perfect setup. It’s about uplifting security posture, step by step. Every verified connection, every workload you isolate, makes your network tougher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Compliance that works across borders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero trust doesn’t toss out your compliance rules — it builds on them. Whether you’re dealing with ISO 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the EU’s NIS2 Directive or any other local telecom regulation, the bottom line stays the same: keep checking your risks, control who gets in and prove you’re on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you bake zero trust into these frameworks, compliance stops being a headache. Instead of just ticking boxes, compliance becomes part of everyday security. As threats shift, your protections shift with them. No matter where your network lives, you’re covered and ready for inspection.&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="measurable-momentum-6-kpis-for-the-first-180-days"&gt;Measurable momentum: 6 KPIs for the first 180 days&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Executives don’t want vague promises — they want proof. In the first six months of rolling out zero trust, here’s what you actually track:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You see fewer privileged accounts floating around.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Strange activity gets spotted faster.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Access approvals don’t drag on — governance finally moves at the speed of business.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More endpoints and workloads are under watch.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;There’s a drop in hackers sneaking around your network.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;IT and OT teams? They’re running real joint-response drills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These aren’t just stats to show off. They prove zero trust isn’t hype — it works. Progress you can point to and build on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From buzzword to baseline&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero trust isn’t just talk anymore. It’s how you measure if a network’s really secure. For telecom, adopting it isn’t for show — it’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gartner says that by 2027, &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/apac/security-risk-management-australia/featured-topics/zero-trust-architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;70% of organizations will start with zero trust for security&lt;/a&gt;. That’s up from less than 20% today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re still clinging to old perimeter defenses, you’re fighting yesterday’s battles. The leaders see zero trust as a journey. They’re building the networks we’ll all count on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New ClickFix attacks use fake Windows Update screens to fool employees</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4096241/new-clickfix-attacks-use-fake-windows-update-screens-to-fool-employees.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs and Windows admins should disable the ability of personal computers to automatically run commands to block the latest version of the ClickFix social engineering attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This advice comes from researchers at Huntress, &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/clickfix-malware-buried-in-images" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;who this week warned&lt;/a&gt; that a new version of ClickFix-based attacks, where employees are tricked into running malicious commands, is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest tactics of this campaign include steganography — hiding malware in the pixels of an image — and a “highly convincing” fake Windows Update screen that asks the user to open a Run prompt, then paste in and run a malicious command.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That command delivers the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3993289/feds-and-microsoft-crush-lumma-stealer-that-stole-millions-of-passwords.html" target="_blank"&gt;LummaC2&lt;/a&gt; and Rhadamanthys infostealers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huntress notes that its report comes after the November 13 &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Endgame law enforcement takedowns&lt;/a&gt; targeting the Rhadamanthys infrastructure. As of November 19, multiple active domains continued to host the Windows Update Lure page associated with the Rhadamanthys campaign. All of these lures point to the same hex-encoded URL structure previously linked to the deployment of Rhadamanthys, although it appears this payload is no longer being hosted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first step defenders should take is to stop the ability of this malware to run, says the report. “The most effective way to mitigate ClickFix is by disabling the Windows Run box,” says Huntress, either by modifying the Windows Registry or deploying GPO (group policy object) rules to block interaction with the Windows Run box.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, the report recommends the standard response for fighting all social engineering attacks: Effective employee security awareness training. “Ensure users are trained on the ClickFix methodology,” says the report, “emphasizing that legitimate CAPTCHA or Windows Update processes will never require pasting and running commands.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="clickfix-warnings"&gt;ClickFix warnings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/08/21/think-before-you-clickfix-analyzing-the-clickfix-social-engineering-technique/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have been warning about ClickFix attacks&lt;/a&gt; (sometimes called pastejacking) since at least early 2024. They often start with a phishing lure that pulls the victim to a realistic fake landing page that purports to be a Windows Update page or a government department website. The heart of the attack is in giving users instructions that involve clicking on prompts and copying, pasting, and running commands directly in  the Windows &lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt; dialog box, Windows Terminal, or Windows PowerShell. This leads to the downloading of scripts that launch malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two new tactics are used in the latest ClickFix campaign, says Huntress:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the use since early October of a fake blue Windows Update splash page in full-screen, displaying realistic “Working on updates” animations that eventually conclude by prompting the user to follow the standard ClickFix pattern: open the Run prompt (Win+R), then paste and run the malicious command.&lt;br /&gt;Why would an employee do this? Because the request is part of an alleged test to prove the victim is human. A screen saying “Human Verification. Follow 3 quick steps to verify you’re not a robot.” is displayed. It’s like a CAPTCHA request, which is familiar to employees these days. In this case, the three steps are: press the Windows button + R (which opens the Run box); press CTRL + V (which pastes in a command that was automatically copied to the clipboard); and then press Enter to “verify” (which actually runs the command that triggers downloading of scripts).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;steganography, which conceals the final malware stages within an image. Rather than simply appending malicious data to a file, the malicious code is encoded directly within the pixel data of PNG images, relying on specific colour channels to reconstruct and decrypt the payload in memory;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an email, report co-author Ana Pham said steganography is not new to malware operations. “What stands out here is the implementation: rather than simply appending malicious data to an image file, this campaign encodes the payload directly into the RGB pixel values of PNG images, extracting shellcode by reading specific color channels and applying XOR decryption. It’s a more involved approach than basic file-appending techniques, designed to evade signature-based detection.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Windows Update-themed tactic is particularly effective because it mimics something users expect to see: a full-screen Windows Update splash page with realistic animations, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given how convincing this lure is compared to standard ‘robot verification’ pages, it’s reasonable to expect other threat actors will adopt similar approaches,” she added. “The source code for these lures contains Russian-language comments and isn’t heavily obfuscated, meaning it could be shared or copied by other groups relatively easily.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attacks-are-now-rampant"&gt;Attacks are now ‘rampant’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ClickFix has become rampant among Huntress’ customers, she said, and is one of the most prevalent threats seen this year. In the past six months, the company has seen a 313% increase in ClickFix-related incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huntress responded to 76 separate incidents tied to this specific campaign over a one month period from late September through October, with attacks targeting organizations across multiple regions, including the United States, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What ties the incidents together is a specific indicator, Pham said: the initial payload, which ultimately delivers the steganographic loader, always contains a URL where the second octet is encoded in hexadecimal format.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 threat intelligence division have also reported seeing more ClickFix attacks. &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/preventing-clickfix-attack-vector/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a July report&lt;/a&gt;, they said attackers lure victims into copying and pasting commands to apply quick fixes to common computer issues such as performance problems, missing drivers, or pop-up errors. Fake tech support forums are one way these attack start. Threat actors have also been known, in other campaigns, to use fake DocuSign and Okta single-sign-on pages to trick users. Payloads include infostealers, remote access trojans (RATS), or tools that disable security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This delivery method bypasses many standard detection and prevention controls” says the Palo Alto report. “There is no exploit, phishing attachment, or malicious link. Instead, potential victims unknowingly run the command themselves, through a trusted system shell. This method makes infections from ClickFix more complicated to detect than drive-by downloads or traditional malware droppers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In yet another instance, researchers at NCC Group today &lt;a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/research-blog/fake-captcha-led-to-lumma/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issued this report&lt;/a&gt; on a ClickFix attack they discovered in May that involved a drive-by compromise and the use of a fake CAPTCHA popup, with the goal of installing the Lumma C2 Stealer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-csos-should-do"&gt;What CSOs should do&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But CSOs aren’t without defenses. One is disabling the Windows Run dialogue through registry modifications or Group Policy. As well, they should audit the RunMRU registry key (which keeps a copy of the most recently executed commands from the Run window) during investigations to check if users have executed suspicious commands through the Run dialog. Palo Alto Networks notes some key indicators for suspicious RunMRU contents could be obfuscated content, keywords related to the download and execution of payloads from unknown or suspicious domains, and keywords indicating calls to administrative interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pham also said leaders should deploy endpoint monitoring for suspicious process chains, particularly watching for &lt;em&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/em&gt; spawning &lt;em&gt;mshta.exe&lt;/em&gt;, or PowerShell with unusual command-line arguments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks also warned that some attackers aim to avoid exposing their activity in the RunMRU registry key by presenting instructions to launch a terminal for PowerShell (Windows 11) or Command Prompt (Windows 10). EDR telemetry or Windows Event Logs will show signs of this tactic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While security awareness training is important, it shouldn’t be the only line of defense, said Pham.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“ClickFix succeeds because it exploits user trust and habitual behavior,” she said. “Users instinctively trust CAPTCHA checks and Windows update screens as routine parts of their day. Even well-trained users can be caught off guard by a convincing full-screen Windows Update animation. The most effective [mitigation] approach combines user education with technical controls: disabling the Run dialog, monitoring for suspicious process behavior, and maintaining robust endpoint detection. Defense in depth matters here, training reduces the likelihood someone falls for the lure, but technical controls provide a safety net when they do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this time Huntress doesn’t have enough evidence to determine whether this specific campaign was run by a particular threat actor or multiple groups of threat actors, Pham noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>JPMorgan, Citi, Morgan Stanley assess fallout from SitusAMC data breach</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4095182/jpmorgan-citi-morgan-stanley-assess-fallout-from-situsamc-data-breach.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley are among the major US banks assessing potential customer data exposure following a cyberattack on SitusAMC, a third-party vendor that processes residential mortgage data for hundreds of financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company discovered the breach on November 12 and confirmed on November 22 that attackers accessed information from its systems, &lt;a href="https://www.situsamc.com/databreach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to a company advisory&lt;/a&gt;. SitusAMC said the compromised data includes corporate information such as accounting records and legal agreements, and that “certain data relating to some of our clients’ customers may also have been impacted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The scope, nature and extent of such impact remains under investigation by the Company and its third-party advisors,” the advisory said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported Saturday that JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley were among institutions notified by SitusAMC about potential client data exposure, citing five people briefed on the incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When contacted by CSO, JPMorgan declined to comment on the breach. Citi and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fbi-says-no-operational-impact-reported"&gt;FBI says no operational impact reported&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FBI Director Kash Patel told The New York Times that the bureau is working with affected organizations to assess the breach. Kash said that the FBI has not yet found any operational impact on banking services and is continuing to investigate the matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SitusAMC, which employs approximately 5,000 people and is owned by several private equity firms, provides loan origination, servicing, and regulatory compliance services to major lenders. The company’s role in mortgage processing involves handling extensive personal information, including Social Security numbers, financial account details, and employment records, as found on loan applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company said that the incident is now contained and services remain fully operational. No encrypting malware was involved, indicating threat actors focused on data exfiltration rather than ransomware deployment, according to the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scope of the breach remains under investigation. SitusAMC said it implemented several security measures following the incident, including credential resets, disabling remote access tools, updating firewall rules, and enhancing security settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="third-party-breaches-accelerating"&gt;Third-party breaches accelerating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SitusAMC incident is part of a broader trend of increasing cyberattacks targeting third-party vendors in the financial services sector. Third parties accounted for 30% of data breaches in 2024, a 15% increase from 2023, according to Venminder’s State of Third-Party Risk Management 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.venminder.com/blog/third-party-cybersecurity-risks-in-financial-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. The survey found 49% of organizations experienced third-party cybersecurity incidents last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The financial services sector has seen particularly heavy vendor-related cyberattack activity. &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/cybersecurity-advisory-third-party-provider-risks"&gt;FINRA observed&lt;/a&gt; a large increase in incidents during the first half of 2024, with threat actors targeting vulnerabilities in system management tools and technology products used by third-party providers. Notable incidents in 2024 included data breaches at Microsoft, Snowflake, and Dropbox that had a widespread impact on financial services firms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, the New York Department of Financial Services issued &lt;a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry-guidance/industry-letters/il20251021-guidance-managing-risks-third-party" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; emphasizing that regulated entities remain fully responsible for cybersecurity when outsourcing to service providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SEC also amended Regulation S-P in 2024 to require firms’ incident response programs to include written policies for overseeing service providers through due diligence and monitoring. The regulation requires firms to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies reasonably designed to require oversight of service providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FINRA has also reminded member firms of their supervisory obligations related to outsourcing to third-party vendors. The self-regulatory organization noted that firms have an obligation to establish and maintain a supervisory system for any activities or functions third-party vendors perform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="investigation-continues"&gt;Investigation continues&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has established a dedicated email for inquiries and said that it will provide updates to clients as the investigation progresses. The advisory did not specify how many institutions or customers may be affected or give a timeline for completing the forensic investigation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are in direct, regular contact with our clients about this matter,” SitusAMC said in the statement. “We remain focused on analyzing any potentially affected data and will provide updates directly to our clients as our investigation progresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Alliances between ransomware groups tied to recent surge in cybercrime</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4096263/alliances-between-ransomware-groups-tied-to-recent-surge-in-cybercrime.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A seasonal surge in malicious activity combined with alliances between &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3509281/top-10-ransomware-groups-to-watch.html"&gt;ransomware groups&lt;/a&gt; led to a 41% increase in attacks between September and October. Cybercriminal group Qilin continues to be the most active &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563507/what-is-ransomware-how-it-works-and-how-to-remove-it.html"&gt;ransomware&lt;/a&gt; paddlers, responsible for 170 of 594 attacks (29%) in October, &lt;a href="https://insights.nccgroup.com/review-of-october-2025-threat-intelligence-report%20"&gt;NCC Group reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinobi and Akira followed with 15% of ransomware attacks rounding up the top three most active ransomware groups in October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ramp-up in ransomware attacks follows several months of relative stability in the number of attacks from April to August, including a dip between April and June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Activity began to pick up at the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer, with September recording a 28% month-on-month increase – momentum that has now accelerated into October’s spike, NCC reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The October surge indicates that threat actors are intensifying their operations ahead of what is typically the most active period for cyber crime. “The fourth ‘golden quarter’ of the year sees peak consumer spending from Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas, presenting greater opportunity for cyber threat actors,” according to NCC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NCC Group’s stats are derived from actively monitoring leak sites favoured by each ransomware group. Of the 594 attacks in October, industrials remained the most targeted sector, with 28% (167) of all attacks. Consumer discretionary (which includes automotive manufacturers, retail businesses, and leisure facilities) suffered 124 attacks. Healthcare moved to third place with 64 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;North America was hit hardest by ransomware attacks, suffering over half of these incidents (62%), compared to Europe (17%) and Asia (9%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An annual &lt;a href="https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/newsroom/active-ransomware-groups-reach-an-all-time-high-guidepoint-security-finds/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Guidepoint Security found a 57% year-over-year increase in active ransomware groups. At the same time ransomware victim numbers have stabilized at approximately 1,500-1,600 per quarter since Q4 2024, according to figures from Guidepoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomware-groups-alliances-axis-of-evil"&gt;Ransomware groups’ alliances: axis of evil&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New players and alliances between ransomware groups contributed to the overall increase in ransomware attacks in October.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://flashpoint.io/blog/lockbit-5-0-analysis-technical-deep-dive-into-the-raas-giants-latest-upgrade/"&gt;newly relaunched LockBit 5.0 group&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4070290/lockbit-dragonforce-and-qilin-form-a-cartel-to-dictate-ransomware-market-conditions.html"&gt;aligned itself with other prominent ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups DragonForce and Qilin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alliances between threat groups enable the sharing of tools, infrastructure and tactics to make their attacks more effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The alliance between LockBit, DragonForce and Qilin combines technical expertise, resources and infrastructure, creating a network capable of sustaining large-scale ransomware operations whilst complicating attribution and response for organisations and law enforcement,” according to NCC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although no coordinated attacks have been confirmed yet these loose alliances could act as a recruiting tool for affiliates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The partnership is also likely aimed at rebuilding LockBit’s reputation within the cybercrime community, reassuring affiliates of its continued relevance and operational capacity following the 2024 law enforcement disruptions,” NCC adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, new entrants in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4054790/ransomware-upstart-the-gentlemen-raises-the-stakes-for-ot%E2%80%91heavy-sectors.html"&gt;The Gentlemen ransomware group&lt;/a&gt; burst onto the threat landscape with 21 attack claims against healthcare, financial services and IT firms, among others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Part of the reason we are seeing more ransomware groups and variants in the landscape is the increasingly lowered technical barrier to entry for cyber crime,” according to NCC. “Ransomware builders have been consistently leaked or released, meaning that threat actors with low levels of technical sophistication are still able to conduct effective campaigns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomware-groups-change-tactics-to-evade-law-enforcement"&gt;Ransomware groups change tactics to evade law enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest quarterly &lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-rapid7-q3-2025-threat-landscape-report/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Rapid7 also found that newly forged alliances are leading to a spike in ransomware activity while adding that tactical innovations, from refined extortion to double extortion and use of zero day, are also playing a part in increased malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The quarter also saw 88 active ransomware groups, up from 65 in Q2 and 76 in Q1, signalling an increase in activity as well as highlighting the changing shape of a febrile threat environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Groups such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4079316/cross-platform-ransomware-qilin-weaponizes-linux-binaries-against-windows-hosts.html"&gt;Qilin&lt;/a&gt;, SafePay, and WorldLeaks led a wave of alliances targeting industries like business services, manufacturing, and healthcare, Rapid7 reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These same groups began experimenting with file-less operations, single-extortion data leaks, and affiliate service offerings such as ransom negotiation assistance, where a more senior member of the group partners with a less experienced player to extort the victim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber extortion incident response firm Coveware reports that remote access compromise, phishing/social engineering, and software vulnerability exploitation remain at the core of intrusion activity, but the distinctions between them are increasingly blurred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Adversaries increasingly obtain access not just by logging into a system, but by convincing someone else to provision it for them,” Coveware explains. “Campaigns that blurred these lines, such as those impersonating SaaS support teams or abusing help-desk processes to gain OAuth authorization, demonstrated how human trust can be engineered into a technical foothold.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Credential-based intrusions through VPNs, cloud gateways, and SaaS integrations continued to serve as the prime vector of ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coveware Q3 2025 ransomware &lt;a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/2025/10/24/insider-threats-loom-while-ransom-payment-rates-plummet#payments"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; identified Akira and Qilin as the two most prominent ransomware variants doing the rounds. Some ransomware groups are rebranding as data-theft-only outfit, ditching file encryption as an extortion tactic, Coveware adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="review-and-reinforce-cybersecurity-measures"&gt;Review and reinforce cybersecurity measures&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Matt Hull, head of threat intelligence at NCC Group, said more than 200 ransomware variants have been identified so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As ransomware activity accelerates and notable attacks continue to cause widespread economic and operational disruption, vigilance is more critical than ever. Organisations should use this moment to reinforce their security measures and test incident response plans,” Hull said. “Proactive monitoring, staff awareness, and secure backups remain key as we move into the year’s peak threat season.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Neue ClickFix-Kampagne nutzt Fake-Windows-Updates</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4096763/neue-clickfix-kampagne-nutzt-fake-windows-updates.html</link>

					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Windows Update" class="wp-image-4000198" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/winUpdate.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Cyberkriminelle nutzen eine gefälschte Windows-Update-Seite, um Mitarbeiter anzugreifen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;PixieMe / Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forscher des Security-Anbieters Huntress sind kürzlich auf eine neue ClickFix-Kampagne gestoßen, die auf Mitarbeiter in Unternehmen zielt. Laut &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/clickfix-malware-buried-in-images" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Forschungsbericht &lt;/a&gt;haben die Angreifer ihre Malware dabei in den Pixeln eines Bildes versteckt, das eine Windows-Update-Seite vortäuscht. Dort werden die Benutzer aufgefordert, auf Ausführen zu klicken, um einen bösartigen Befehl einzufügen und auszuführen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dieser Befehl liefert Infostealer LummaC2 und Rhadamanthys aus. Huntress weist darauf hin, dass sein Bericht nach dem 13. November veröffentlicht wurde, als der &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089207/operation-endgame-schaltet-schadsoftware-ab.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ermittlungserfolg gegen Rhadamanthys&lt;/a&gt; bekannt gegeben wurde. Demnach hosteten mehrere aktive Domains noch am 19. November die gefälschte Windows Update -Seite, die mit der Rhadamanthys-Kampagne in Verbindung steht. „Alle Fake-Seiten verweisen auf dieselbe codierte URL-Struktur, die zuvor mit dem Einsatz von Rhadamanthys in Verbindung stand“, so die Forscher. Die Payload wird jedoch offenbar nicht mehr gehostet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="clickfix-angriffe-sind-nichts-neues"&gt;ClickFix-Angriffe sind nichts Neues&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4018769/clickfix-attacken-bedrohen-unternehmenssicherheit.html" target="_blank"&gt;haben bereits zuvor vor ClickFix-Angriffen&lt;/a&gt; (manchmal auch als „Pastejacking“ bezeichnet) gewarnt. Sie beginnen oft mit einem Phishing-Köder, der das Opfer auf eine realistisch aussehende gefälschte Landing Page lockt, die vorgibt, eine Windows Update-Seite oder eine Website einer Regierungsbehörde zu sein. Der Kern des Angriffs besteht darin, den Benutzern Anweisungen zu geben, die das Klicken auf Eingabeaufforderungen und das Kopieren, Einfügen und Ausführen von Befehlen direkt im Windows-Dialogfeld „Ausführen“, Windows Terminal oder Windows PowerShell beinhalten. Dies führt zum Herunterladen von Skripten, die Malware starten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ana Pham von Huntress betont gegenüber CSO, dass Steganografie für Malware-Operationen nichts Neues ist. „Das Besondere daran ist die Umsetzung: Anstatt einfach nur schädliche Daten an eine Bilddatei anzuhängen, verschlüsselt diese Kampagne die Payload direkt in den RGB-Pixelwerten von PNG-Bildern, extrahiert Shellcode durch das Auslesen bestimmter Farbkanäle und wendet eine XOR-Entschlüsselung an.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dies sei aufwendiger als einfache Techniken zum Anhängen von Dateien, die darauf ausgelegt sind, signaturbasierte Erkennung zu umgehen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Die Taktik mit dem Windows Update-Motiv ist besonders effektiv, weil sie etwas nachahmt, was die Nutzer erwarten: eine Vollbild- -Seite von Windows Update mit realistischen Animationen“, sagt sie. „Der Quellcode dieser Köder enthält Kommentare in russischer Sprache und ist nicht stark verschleiert, sodass er relativ leicht von anderen Gruppen geteilt oder kopiert werden kann.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forscher der NCC Group haben kürzlich einen weiteren &lt;a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/research-blog/fake-captcha-led-to-lumma/"&gt;Bericht&lt;/a&gt; über einen ClickFix-Angriff veröffentlicht, den sie im Mai 2025 entdeckt haben. Konkret geht es dabei um eine Drive-by-Kompromittierung und die Verwendung eines gefälschten CAPTCHA-Popups – mit dem Ziel, den Lumma C2 Stealer zu installieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tipps-zum-schutz"&gt;Tipps zum Schutz&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der erste Schritt zur Verteidigung gegen Clickfix-Angriffen besteht laut dem Huntress-Experten Pham darin, die Ausführung der Malware zu unterbinden. „Die effektivste Methode zur Abwehr von ClickFix ist die Deaktivierung des Windows-Ausführungsfelds“, so Huntress, „entweder durch Änderungen in der Windows-Registry oder durch Einsatz von GPO-Regeln (Group Policy Object), um die Interaktion mit dem Windows-Ausführungsfeld zu blockieren.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zudem wird eine Standardmaßnahme zur Bekämpfung aller Social-Engineering-Angriffe empfohlen: eine effektive Schulung der Mitarbeiter zum Thema Sicherheitsbewusstsein. „Stellen Sie sicher, dass die Anwender die ClickFix-Methodik kennen“, heißt es in dem Bericht. „Betonen Sie, dass legitime CAPTCHA- oder Windows-Update-Prozesse niemals das Einfügen und Ausführen von Befehlen erfordern.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Außerdem sollten CISOsSie den RunMRU-Registrierungsschlüssel (der eine Kopie der zuletzt ausgeführten Befehle aus dem Ausführungsfenster speichert) überprüfen, um festzustellen, ob Benutzer verdächtige Befehle über den Ausführungsdialog ausgeführt haben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pham empfiehlt außerdem den Einsatz von Endpoint-Monitoring überwachung für verdächtige Prozessketten –  insbesondere mit Blick auf Fälle, in denen explorer.exe mshta.exe oder PowerShell mit ungewöhnlichen Befehlszeilenargumenten startet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Sicherheitsbewusstseinstrainings sind zwar wichtig, sollten aber nicht die einzige Verteidigungslinie sein“, so Pham. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>AI browsers can be tricked with malicious prompts hidden in URL fragments</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4097087/ai-browsers-can-be-tricked-with-malicious-prompts-hidden-in-url-fragments.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have demonstrated another indirect prompt injection attack against AI-powered browsers and browser assistants that could lead to phishing, sensitive data exfiltration, credential theft, or malware downloads. The attack, dubbed HashJack, relies on rogue prompts added to URLs after the hash (#) symbol, also known as a named anchor or URL fragment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“HashJack is the first known indirect prompt injection that can weaponize any legitimate website to manipulate AI browser assistants,” researchers from Cato Networks said in the &lt;a href="https://www.catonetworks.com/blog/cato-ctrl-hashjack-first-known-indirect-prompt-injection/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, AI browsers —  including Comet (Perplexity), Copilot for Edge (Microsoft), and Gemini for Chrome (Google) — can be used to enable a wide range of malicious attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-client-side-attack"&gt;A client-side attack&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The # character inside a URL has multiple uses: The portion after it tells the browser to jump to a specific section of the loaded page; it can tell JavaScript code on the page what to display in an in-page dynamic navigation scenario; or it can be used to save state information about the user interface, such as user-selected options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One important aspect is that URL fragment data is never sent to the web server or over the network. It’s only meant for the browser or the code already loaded on the client side. And it turns out that since AI browser assistants are designed to analyze the currently open website for context, they also read the URL fragments passed after #, and these can hide malicious prompts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The client-side nature of this attack means traditional network defenses, such as IPS/IDS and network firewalls, can’t detect it. Server logs don’t capture the portion of URLs after # because it’s never sent to the server, and browser defenses like Content Security Policy (CSP) don’t trigger because nothing on the actual web page is changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tricking-users-into-clicking-poisoned-links"&gt;Tricking users into clicking poisoned links&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HashJack is essentially a social engineering attack because it relies on tricking users to click on specially crafted URLs inside emails, chats, websites, or documents. However, this attack can be highly credible because it points to legitimate websites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, imagine a spoofed email that claims to be from a bank advising customers about suspicious activity in their accounts. Hovering over the link included in the email shows that it points to the bank’s real website, HTTPS and everything, but it’s a long link and somewhere in it there’s the # character followed by a prompt for the AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many users are likely to trust such a message since it points to the real bank’s website and because long links with a lot of parameters and paths in them are not unusual. But the prompt that follows the # symbol will cause the AI browser assistant to provide attacker-altered instructions to the user, such as calling an attacker-controlled phone number or WhatsApp link for further customer support about the supposed situation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another scenario, a prompt included in the link can tell an AI browser that acts like an agent —  for example, Perplexity’s Comet —  to take information about the user’s account, transaction history, phone number, and so on from the opened bank site and append it as parameters in a request to the attacker’s server.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other attacks could involve the prompt causing the AI assistant to display fake information that would mislead the user: fake investment advice promoting a certain stock, fabricated news, dangerous medical advice like wrong doses for medicine, malicious instructions that could open a backdoor on the computer, instructions to re-authenticate that include a link to a phishing site, a link to download malware, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;URL fragments cannot modify page content. They are only used for in-page navigation using the code that’s already there, so they are normally harmless. However, it now turns out that they can be used to modify the output of in-browser AI assistants or agentic browsers, which gives them an entirely new risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This discovery is especially dangerous because it weaponizes legitimate websites through their URLs,” the researchers said. “Users see a trusted site, trust their AI browser, and in turn trust the AI assistant’s output-making the likelihood of success far higher than with traditional phishing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different behavior across AI assistantsThe impact was different between the tested AI assistants and across the various scenarios. For example, while prompt injections managed to influence the text output on all the products tested, injecting malicious links proved harder on Gemini Assistant for Chrome, where some links were rewritten as search URLs, and on Edge with Microsoft Copilot, which prompted for additional confirmation when clicking on links in messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perplexity’s Comet, which is an agentic browser that does more than a built-in AI assistant, was the most susceptible one because it also could fetch attacker URLs in the background, with context information attached as parameters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Perplexity deployed fixes, but Google did not consider the HashJack technique a vulnerability because it views this as part of intended behavior. It’s worth noting that Cato also tested Claude for Chrome and OpenAI’s Operator browser, but the HashJack technique didn’t work on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>SonicWall ransomware attacks offer an M&amp;A lesson for CSOs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4097078/sonicwall-ransomware-attacks-offer-an-ma-lesson-for-csos.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent ransomware attacks on organizations with SonicWall SSL VPNs may teach more lessons than just the need for patch management and identity and access control. Some of the victim firms had vulnerable SonicWall devices on their IT networks as legacies of past mergers or acquisitions, suggesting infosec leaders need to be more involved in preparing for M&amp;amp;A deals or risk their organizations being stung by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the conclusion &lt;a href="https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-akira-ransomwares-sonicwall-campaign-creates-enterprise-m&amp;amp;a-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from a report this week by researchers at ReliaQuest.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They looked at a series of attacks between June and October using the Akira ransomware strain to target SonicWall SSL VPNs, and found a link: In almost every incident, hackers gained a foothold on an enterprise network by compromising a SonicWall device inherited from a smaller acquired business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked, ReliaQuest wouldn’t say how many incidents it had investigated. But the report does say that in each case, IT wasn’t aware the devices were currently in their environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Standard M&amp;amp;A due diligence is not enough,” says the report. “Security teams must proactively secure inherited technologies, prioritizing early visibility into new environments, like remote access tools, to address risky configurations and outdated credentials before attackers exploit them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The warning isn’t new. Experts have been saying for years that examining a potential acquisition’s finances isn’t enough. Scrutinizing its IT assets also has to be involved, so boards understand both the financial and the cyber risks of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exhibit A: The discovery in 2018 by &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567795/marriott-data-breach-faq-how-did-it-happen-and-what-was-the-impact.html" target="_blank"&gt;Marriott that data on hundreds of millions of guests from the reservation system of its Starwood chain of hotels&lt;/a&gt; had been stolen. Marriott bought Starwood in 2016. Its network had been infiltrated two years earlier, and the breach was undetected for four years, even after the Marriott acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security leaders do need to be involved in the M&amp;amp;A process,” said &lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/fred-chagnon" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fred Chagnon&lt;/a&gt;, a principal research director at Info-Tech Research, which did a case study on the Marriott-Starwood incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One reason why CSOs/CIOs and their equivalents aren’t brought in, he said, is that cyber risk is invisible compared to the hard numbers that can be found in financial records. As a result, “we’ve had difficulty in this industry in communicating cyber risks as financial liabilities” to CEOs and boards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT leaders have to push the message that security risk is enterprise risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he added, the board has to be reminded that it is responsible for assessing the cyber as well as the financial risks of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related content: &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/415233/why-and-when-cios-deserve-a-seat-at-the-ma-negotiating-table.html" target="_blank"&gt;Why, and when, CIOs deserve a seat at the M&amp;amp;A negotiating table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should infosec leaders be asked to be part of an M&amp;amp;A team, the actual assessment of the potential acquisition should be contracted to a third party expert, Chagnon added. That’s because the security team won’t have time to do it themselves, and the other side will likely be more willing to divulge sensitive IT information to a third party than to a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The majority of M&amp;amp;A activities still follow a security checklist approach, noted&lt;a href="https://cypfer.com/team-member/ed-dubrovsky/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Ed Dubrovski&lt;/a&gt;, chief operating officer of incident response firm Cypfer, “which essentially is really a glorified third party vendor assessment. Such activities meet the check-in-the-box requirements but do nothing really to address the real core of the issue: lack of current and relevant information about possible risks.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those doing cybersecurity assessments of a potential acquisition should start with an inventory or list of IT assets before asking if the organization has an information security policy and underlying policies, he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After an acquisition, CSOs should treat the new network as a third party connection request and keep it segmented until the core risks have been quantified before attempting to integrate environments, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality is that the combined risk posture is [only] as good as the riskiest party,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity posture of an acquisition should be a high priority for inspection during the due diligence period, agreed &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fsmontenegro/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fernando Montenegro&lt;/a&gt;, vice president and cybersecurity practice lead at advisory firm Futurum, regardless of the size of the business being acquired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security team must be properly connected to the rest of the organization, including the corporate development (corpdev) group that typically spearheads mergers and acquisitions, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The challenge here is that security teams should work with corpdev to have the right framework to analyze these deals, including interviews with key executives at the target company, access to any audit/compliance documentation, and a thorough look at the digital footprint and internal state of the acquired company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, he added, the program includes both ‘outside-in’ and ‘inside-out’ perspectives on the potential acquisition, a thorough review of their security program, history of any security incidents, key third-party relationships they may have, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there will be numerous considerations about what the IT integration will look like, including network connectivity and business application connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In its report, ReliaQuest notes that SonicWall devices are often used by small and mid-sized firms, which are often M&amp;amp;A targets of larger companies. However, it said, it can’t be sure firms were targeted by Akira operators because they’d swallowed organizations that had SonicWall devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It did say that in the incidents examined, once inside the victims’ networks, the attackers immediately looked for privileged accounts, such as those originating from old managed service provider (MSP) or administrator logins, that had been transferred over during the M&amp;amp;A process. “Crucially, these credentials were often unknown to the acquiring company, and left unmonitored and unrotated post-acquisition,” the report says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We asked ReliaQuest how often vulnerabilities in technology acquired from an M&amp;amp;A cause later breaches of security controls. In response, a spokesperson said, “the fact that we’ve seen consecutive breaches of Akira targeting smaller organizations where they are leveraging vulnerabilities means that larger organizations should address the risks during onboarding and understand the scope before purchasing.”   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
