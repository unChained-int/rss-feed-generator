      <title>Equifax Europe CISO: Notorious breach spurred cybersecurity transformation</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109026/javier-checa-equifax-now-the-security-culture-is-part-of-our-dna-as-a-company.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2017 Equifax breach was &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/534628/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html"&gt;one of biggest security incidents of the 21st century&lt;/a&gt;. A textbook data leak case, the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567833/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html"&gt;breach impacted more than 147 million people&lt;/a&gt;, spawning a number of scandals and controversies, with the credit reporting agency being criticized for a range of issues, from a lax security posture to their botched response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The high-profile incident has proved transformational for the company. In the wake of the breach, the multinational company has fortified itself and now even provides advanced solutions for risk management, fraud, and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.es/article/2121033/la-leccion-mas-importante-que-equifax-ha-aprendido-es-que-no-quiere-volver-a-vivir-un-incidente-asi.html"&gt;Javier Checa&lt;/a&gt;, the current CISO of Equifax for Continental Europe, is a computer scientist with more than 20 years of experience in senior cybersecurity positions at various companies, including serving as information security director at El Corte Inglés. Checa wasn’t with Equifax when the data breach occurred; he joined three years later. But he did experience the incident, which he describes as “very significant,” from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As he recalls in an interview with CSO/Computerworld Spain, although “there had already been other similar incidents, for some reason, probably due to the type of customer and consumer information that Equifax handles, it did have a major impact on the industry at that time.” Furthermore, he adds: “While it’s true that in subsequent years there have been much more serious incidents, [the Equifax breach] was a watershed moment in everything related to cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-quick-learning-curve"&gt;A quick learning curve&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Checa praises the work done by Mark W. Begor, Equifax’s CEO since 2018, and &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.es/article/2120505/jamil-farshchi-ciso-de-equifax-la-seguridad-no-deberia-ser-un-secreto-comercial.html"&gt;Jamil Farshchi,&lt;/a&gt; Equifax’s global EVP, CISO, and CTO, who have led a complete transformation of the company at a time when it was still very badly affected both financially — it had to face $700 million in fines, compensation, and expenses to protect consumers after the data breach — and from a reputational point of view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A path in which the CEO’s “personal” commitment to adopting the cloud IT delivery model and the strengthening of cybersecurity and trust to make the company a “security leader” have been vital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Equifax has invested nearly $3 billion in a complete overhaul of both our technology and security platforms,” ​​Checa says, adding that the change in the company’s IT strategy is “comprehensive”: “Before, the focus was more on technology, while now security is part of everything we do; it’s embedded in all our processes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s CISO for Continental Europe explains that Equifax has built its strategy on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and its Privacy Framework, which focuses more on the issue of privacy risks and the protection of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Where are we now?” he asks. “We’re in a happy place because we’ve already completed the transformation of our infrastructure to the cloud model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cloud-as-a-new-technological-axis"&gt;Cloud as a new technological axis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Equifax’s $3 billion migration to the cloud, “which had been brewing for about seven years” and which the company says is the largest technological investment in its history, has involved moving more than 300 systems, over 30 product families, and thousands of customers to the company’s cloud platform, Equifax Cloud, in Spain alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now, in Spain, for several months now, all the applications and products we serve to our customers are delivered from the cloud,” Checa says. The project, carried out with Google Cloud, has not only consisted of migrating workloads, he adds, but “restructuring, reorganizing, and refactoring all our assets to truly become a cloud-native company.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The impact of cloud adoption on the company’s security strategy has been clear: “My security philosophy isn’t just about defining a framework of controls; security must have a very important technological component directly related to simplicity. Migrating to the cloud has made it easier for us to simplify all the components and the way we develop,” Checa explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The European CISO adds that it has been positive for the company to “reduce legacy systems to zero,” one of the biggest problems for companies with a long market history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now we have a live infrastructure whose systems we update and re-platform every month, something previously unthinkable,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has also seen its security processes simplified. “Aligning the cloud transformation with the security changes has allowed us to implement security controls, measures, and processes that are completely aligned with all the new technology we have,” he points out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="360-degree-safety-culture"&gt;360-degree safety culture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now, a security culture is part of our DNA as a company,” says Checa, who works within the multinational’s team of 300 cybersecurity specialists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But “security isn’t just the responsibility of the technology or security team, but of every employee in the company,” he adds. An example of this mindset is that, “as Jamil [Farshchi] often mentions, Equifax was the first publicly traded company whose employees could access a bonus that included security as one of its components; an initiative that other companies have since copied.” With this, Checa asserts, the company conveys the importance of cybersecurity to its entire workforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the foundations of the multinational’s information security strategy, Checa doesn’t hesitate: “Transparency and collaboration are our cybersecurity pillars.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first, “a commitment from the CEO himself,” has been key to regaining customer trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2017, after the incident, we needed to win back our customers’ confidence. It’s important to remember that at that time the company’s stock price dropped significantly,” the CISO explains. “Having delivered on our promises is one of the reasons why the company’s stock price is now even higher than before the 2017 incident.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s another kind of transparency, “the kind we demand of ourselves,” Checa continues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Jamil always says it’s easy to be motivated [to be transparent] after a security incident, but the challenge is maintaining that focus over time.” That’s why, Checa adds, the company decided five years ago to launch an annual security report “where we truly open our doors and provide information that few companies had previously offered, from indicators of how long it takes us to respond to an incident to the click-through rate in our phishing simulations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Information, he says, that has helped Equifax gain in transparency and customer loyalty. Moreover, he acknowledges, “the biggest lesson learned from the incident is the need to be transparent to regain customer trust.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regarding the second pillar, collaboration, Checa is clear about its value: “In the new environment of escalating threats we live in, we understand that no one can win this battle alone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in addition to sharing security information to be more transparent, Equifax publishes its list of controls so that any company can use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We publish our core security not only for the sake of transparency, but so that all companies and governments worldwide can use it — information that has taken us a great deal of effort to develop,” Checa says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he emphasizes that Equifax collaborates with security agencies such as the FBI and participates in more than 30 security forums. “We share knowledge, collaborate with states in developing their security awareness programs, and have even helped them resolve some security breaches,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the cyberattack on Equifax had an economic motive, the reasons driving cybercriminals today are highly diverse. “With the rise in geopolitical tension, new threats emerge and new actors enter the scene,” explains Checa. These threats, he acknowledges, are “more complex, persistent, and sophisticated,” and the actors “aren’t really seeking short-term financial gain, but rather accumulating resources that will later facilitate other practices related to espionage, influence, and even corruption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://assets.equifax.com/assets/corp/equifax-2024-security-annual-report-sp.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s latest report, with data from 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Equifax neutralizes more than 15 million cyber threats every day, which represents 175 hostile attempts every second, a 25% increase compared to 2023. “We have seen a significant increase in attacks carried out with artificial intelligence,” Checa adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He reflects that AI “has democratized cyberattacks, and now people with less technical knowledge can carry out more complex attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Checa also mentions the rise of deepfakes, audiovisual content that appears real but has been manipulated with AI to deceive the audience. “To counter this, we have migrated to an authentication platform that allows employees accessing our services to use other authentication factors, both biometric and otherwise, instead of passwords.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI, on the other hand, is also already a defensive weapon, although Checa urges against using it for everything in cybersecurity, or certainly not as the sole option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our strategy is hybrid. AI alone isn’t capable of defending everything, although it’s a great help. But you can’t base all your defenses on a single technology; the more controls you put in different places and the more different types of technologies you use, the better,” he says, explaining that Equifax leverages various signature protection technologies, among many others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-of-a-regional-ciso"&gt;Challenges of a regional CISO&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO acknowledges that cybersecurity management at Equifax is an activity handled internally and globally, although supported by local teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My responsibility as regional CISO is to ensure that the company’s security program is properly implemented at the European level and that we are able to adapt to our specific regulatory environment,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Checa welcomes the EU’s regulatory push in cybersecurity. “The main regulations that affect us are DORA, as financial service providers, and NIS2, and frankly, they haven’t required anything we weren’t already doing; we’ve simply had to adapt certain aspects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He acknowledges that the need to comply with regulations means that “many companies with our risk appetite can secure the necessary cybersecurity budgets,” and he points out that the NIS2 regulation has not yet been transposed into Spanish law. “But the delay also means that the transposition is being taken with the importance it deserves,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He further argues that regulation has led to senior management now being directly responsible for company security, which has helped place it at the heart of corporate strategy in many companies. “The most important aspect of cybersecurity regulation, beyond the streamlining of processes and controls imposed by these regulations, is its strategic alignment with senior management.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The executive is pleased that security, especially since the 2017 incident, has a high profile among Equifax’s senior management. “In fact, I, as Equifax’s CISO for Continental Europe, am part of the management committee, where the budget for this matter is decided,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regarding the evolution of the CISO role in the market in general, Checa states: “I’ve been working in security since 2003, so yes, I’ve seen a clear change in this function.” First, he recalls, because “it’s a role that didn’t even exist before, and when it emerged, it had a primarily technical focus. Over the years, it has evolved into a more strategic company profile, more closely tied to the business. The CISO must be a communicator capable of explaining the implications of cybersecurity for the business.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the relationship CISOs should have with their CIOs&lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3962903/la-convivencia-entre-cio-y-ciso-dos-cargos-al-alza.html"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; to whom many CISOs report, Checa says: “In my opinion, there should be a certain degree of independence between the CIO and the CISO, but every company is different. In our case, our global CISO sits on the global management committee; we do as well at the local level.” He acknowledges, however, that from a tactical perspective, it’s beneficial to have close ties with the company’s IT department. “But, as I said, the important thing is to analyze each company’s specific circumstances, its risk appetite, and what works best for it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Checa states that one of his biggest challenges as Equifax’s CISO for Continental Europe is “continuing to adapt to regulatory changes and being able to anticipate and adjust to all the new threats that emerge.” He adds, “My greatest commitment to the company is to be a security leader that delivers value and business. To be a differentiator. That’s what truly motivates and concerns me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not forgetting all the work Equifax is already doing — which Checa says he can’t reveal — to be prepared for the post-quantum era: “We have very strong internal initiatives in this regard,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Checa works, as he explains, “to ensure that security truly becomes a differentiator from a business perspective, and this, of course, involves protecting all the highly sensitive information we have about our clients and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He acknowledges that the role of CISO is “very stressful, but also very rewarding, requiring you to give your best, keep learning, and always be prepared for change.” He concludes that this role must be aware that “you can never reach the final state of security with all the evolving threats, technologies, and problems that exist today.”&lt;/p&gt;

He joined the global credit information company in September 2021 as a senior security analyst and currently combines the role of CISO with that of security risk officer for Equifax Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checa is a professional with more than 20 years of experience in the cybersecurity field, with expertise in risk management, network security, identity management, security operations or DevSecOps. Before joining Equifax, he had responsibilities in cybersecurity at Capgemini, CGI, British Telecom and El Corte Inglés, where he was director of information security, leading several security programs for more than 200,000 users and 5,000 developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checa studied Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Madrid and holds degrees in Data Networks Security Paradigms from the French National Higher School of Telecommunications and in Computer Aided Design of Digital Systems from the European Board of Technology Students, in addition to holding several specific certifications in the field of cybersecurity.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>Critical vulnerability in IBM API Connect could allow authentication bypass</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4112265/critical-vulnerability-in-ibm-api-connect-could-allow-authentication-bypass-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IBM is urging customers to quickly patch a critical vulnerability in its API Connect platform that could allow remote attackers to bypass authentication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company describes &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/api-connect" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;API Connect&lt;/a&gt; as a full lifecycle application programming interface (API) gateway used “to create, test, manage, secure, analyze, and socialize APIs.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It particularly touts it as a way to “unlock the potential of agentic AI” by providing a central point of control for access to AI services via APIs. The platform also includes API Agent, which automates tasks across the API lifecycle using AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key component is a customizable self-service portal that allows developers to easily onboard themselves, and to discover and consume multiple types of API, including SOAP, REST, events, ASyncAPIs, GraphQL, and others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flaw, tracked as &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-13915" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-13915&lt;/a&gt;, affects IBM API Connect versions 10.0.8.0 through 10.0.8.5, and version 10.0.11.0, and could give unauthorized access to the exposed applications, with no user interaction required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="an-architectural-assumption-is-broken"&gt;An architectural assumption is broken&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CVE-2025-13915 is not best understood as a security bug,” said &lt;a href="https://greyhoundresearch.com/svg/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sanchit Vir Gogia&lt;/a&gt;, chief analyst at Greyhound Research. “It is better understood as a moment where a long standing architectural assumption finally breaks in the open. The assumption is simple and deeply embedded in enterprise design: If traffic passes through the API gateway, identity has been enforced and trust has been established. This vulnerability proves that assumption can fail completely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He noted that the classification of the weakness, which maps to &lt;a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CWE-305&lt;/a&gt;, is important because it rules out a whole class of what he called comforting explanations. “This is not stolen credentials. It is not role misconfiguration. It is not a permissions mistake,” he said. “The authentication enforcement itself can be circumvented.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When that happens, he explained, downstream services do not simply face elevated risk, they lose the foundation on which their access decisions were built because they do not revalidate identity. They were never designed to; they inherit trust. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Once enforcement fails upstream, inherited trust becomes unearned trust, and the exposure propagates silently,”  he said. “This class of vulnerability aligns with automation, broad scanning, and opportunistic probing rather than careful targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="interim-fixes-provided"&gt;Interim fixes provided&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IBM said that the issue was discovered during internal testing, and it has provided interim fixes for each affected version of the software, with individual update details for VMware, OCP/CP4I, and Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only mitigation suggested for the flaw, according to IBM’s &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7255149" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;security bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, is this: “Customers unable to install the interim fix should disable self-service sign-up on their Developer Portal if enabled, which will help minimize their exposure to this vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company also notes in its &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/7255318" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; for the fixes that the image overrides described in the document must be removed when upgrading to the next release or fixpack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This, said Gogia, further elevates the risk. “That is not a cosmetic detail,” he noted. “Management planes define configuration truth, lifecycle control, and operational authority across the platform. When remediation touches this layer, the vulnerability sits close to the control core, not at an isolated gateway edge. That raises both blast radius and remediation risk.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is because errors in these areas can turn into prolonged exposure or service instability. “[Image overrides] also introduce a governance hazard: Image overrides create shadow state; if they are not explicitly removed later, they persist quietly,” he pointed out. “Over time, they drift out of visibility, ownership, and audit scope. This is how temporary fixes turn into long term risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="most-valuable-outcome-learning"&gt;Most valuable outcome: Learning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that the operational challenges involved in remediation are not so much in knowing what has to be done, but in doing it fast enough without breaking the business. And, he said, API governance now needs to include up to date inventories of APIs, their versions, dependencies, and exposure points, as well as monitoring of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most valuable outcome here is not closure,” Gogia observed. “It is learning. Enterprises should ask what would have happened if this flaw had been exploited quietly for weeks. Which services would have trusted the gateway implicitly? Which logs would have shown abnormal behavior? Which teams would have noticed first? Those answers reveal whether trust assumptions are visible or invisible. Organizations that stop at patching will miss a rare opportunity to strengthen resilience before the next control plane failure arrives.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity leaders’ resolutions for 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110151/cybersecurity-leaders-resolutions-for-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the AI-hype dust settles, CISOs have a lot to focus on 2026. From ongoing struggles such as ensuring teams are not burning out to current and future concerns, which includes finding effective business cases for AI, focusing on spotting a breach before it happens to planning for looming fear of breaking quantum encryption, CISOs from different industries share what is top of their agenda for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-prioritize-resilience-over-reactive-security"&gt;1. Prioritize resilience over reactive security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emphasis on resilience and architectural discipline, particularly as organizations face even greater reliance on cloud infrastructure, is part of Fortitude Re CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliottfranklin/"&gt;Elliott Franklin&lt;/a&gt;’s resolutions. “Our approach will focus on well-structured project management and intentional design,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any new initiative will start with a clear architectural plan and a deep understanding of end-to-end dependencies and potential points of failure. “By taking a thoughtful, engineering-driven approach — rather than reacting to outages or disruptions — we aim to strengthen the stability, scalability, and reliability of our systems,” he says. “This foundation enables the business to move with confidence, knowing our technology and security investments are built to endure and evolve.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-ai-will-dominate-the-agenda"&gt;2. AI will dominate the agenda&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered group CISO Cezary Piekarski expects his agenda to be dominated by AI in two ways: defining both the threat landscape and defensive architecture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Speed is essential when mitigating attacks so leveraging AI and orchestration tools allows us to quickly automate detection and streamline incident response,” Piekarski says. “This reduces dwell time significantly and accelerates remediation, ensuring that threats are contained before they escalate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As new attack surfaces emerge with AI-driven applications and systems, Piekarski’s priorities will focus on defending and hardening the environment against AI-enabled threats and tactics. “It’s harnessing the opportunities of AI across the cyber stack and enabling the bank to use AI securely and safely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qiagen CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-daniel-schatz/"&gt;Daniel Schatz&lt;/a&gt; expects artificial intelligence to remain a core theme across 2026 “in terms of using AI to improve security controls and operations, and ensuring AI is securely integrated into products.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He expects a notable escalation in the sophistication and scale of generative AI enabled threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we have observed so far are largely handcrafted AI-supported campaigns, but they will likely evolve into more automated and industrialized social-engineering operations, following the same pattern seen with most emerging threats,” Schatz says. “With generative AI becoming ubiquitous, technologies that help organizations understand, manage, and secure the AI attack surface will quickly rise in importance. It’s critical that the industry embeds appropriate security controls from the start, so we avoid repeating the mistakes seen during the early days of web development.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-achieve-visibility-and-control-especially-with-ai"&gt;3. Achieve visibility and control, especially with AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The priority for &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/conalg/"&gt;Conal Gallagher,&lt;/a&gt; Flexera’s CIO and CISO, is balancing productivity with protecting intellectual property as Flexera teams use AI tools and chatbots. “We’re working to standardize trusted, enterprise-grade AI solutions, while putting controls in place to prevent data leakage from unsanctioned tools.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, SaaS management and discovery tools will be used to get a handle on shadow IT and unsanctioned AI usage. Automation for compliance and reporting will be important as customer and regulatory requirements around ESG and security continue to grow, along with threat intelligence feeds and vulnerability management solutions that help Gallagher and the team stay ahead of what’s happening in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The common thread is visibility and control; we need to know what’s in our environment, how it’s being used, and that we can respond quickly when things change,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-manage-human-and-non-human-identities"&gt;4. Manage human and non-human identities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schatz is focused on managing human and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009316/how-cybersecurity-leaders-can-defend-against-the-spur-of-ai-driven-nhi.html"&gt;non-human identities&lt;/a&gt;. He expects technologies that enable effective identity management will continue to be critical. “Human identities remain challenging to protect, and non-human identities are only beginning to grow in scale with the emergence of agentic AI,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a similar plan, Franklin is prioritizing identity and privilege management — across both human and non-human identities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s [about] ensuring that service accounts, APIs, and automation tools are governed with the same rigor as user accounts,” Franklin says. “As automation grows, effectively managing these digital identities will be critical to maintaining trust, traceability, and control in complex environments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal is to strengthen the organization’s overall resilience while enabling productivity and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-build-security-into-agentic-ai-products"&gt;5. Build security into agentic AI products&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some are prioritizing building security directly into agentic AI products to mitigate sophisticated attacks. “We’re moving beyond simply trying to stop AI risks to engineering security directly into our agentic solutions, ensuring the secure path to innovation is the fastest path for our teams,” Qualtrics CSO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/assafkeren/"&gt;Assaf Keren&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keren will be utilizing AI to strengthen security capabilities, automate and accelerate internal functions like SOC triage and control testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-link-security-with-trust"&gt;6. Link security with trust&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Keren, 2026 is also about making security a visible trust signal, not just a back-office function. He’s looking to transform security into a proactive, transparent partnership with their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Customers are making purchasing decisions based on how organizations handle data and AI. Treating security as a go-to-market advantage, not just risk mitigation,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means getting certified with FedRAMP High, ISO 42001 for AI, being transparent about security practices, and making security posture a visible part of the value proposition. “Organizations that can credibly demonstrate robust security and responsible AI practices will win customers who are increasingly making decisions based on trust.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-develop-a-quantum-readiness-plan"&gt;7. Develop a quantum readiness plan&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Quantum computing poses significant cyber risks by potentially breaking current encryption methods, impacting data security, and enabling new attack vectors,” says Piekarski.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, Piekarski and the team are actively preparing for what lies ahead and that means quantum threats. “In 2026, we’ll continue progress on our multi-year, resilient cryptography preparedness strategy to meet the challenges of the emerging threat and address associated risks,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jon France, CISO, ISC2, urges CISOs to prepare for post-quantum cryptography. This involves reviewing their own organization and systems and then turning to their vendors and partners about their readiness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The roadmap includes a cryptographic inventory and then asking [vendors] ‘what are you doing on quantum and what’s your roadmap?’ There will be some things you’ll have to sunset, probably earlier than you thought, so you have to plan around that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-protect-people-not-just-systems"&gt;8. Protect people, not just systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2026 and beyond, security strategies will need to consider workforce resilience, not only tools, controls, and compliance as stress and skills transformation permanently reshape the cyber workforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With burnout an ever-present problem, AI changing skills and jobs, and economic conditions putting pressure on budgets, CISOs must look after the wellbeing of their teams as much as the technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Looking after the team while leveraging the team but without killing them is on our agenda,” says France.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-spot-breaches-early"&gt;9. Spot breaches early&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As cloud systems expand and supply chains stretch further, the old idea of total prevention is fading fast. CISOs will be under increasing pressure to prioritize detection and response in their security program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The strongest security programs won’t be the ones that stop every breach, they’ll be the ones that spot them first,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-bee/"&gt;Jan Bee&lt;/a&gt;, TeamViewer’s CISO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bee believes that instead of building a fortress around the organization, CISOs will need to favor visibility and speed. “In the age of agentic AI and hyperconnected SaaS, that speed will be everything,” says Bee. “The organizations that can see trouble coming in seconds will stay ahead of even the most heavily defended but slow-to-react peers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-get-ahead-of-the-threat-curve"&gt;10. Get ahead of the threat curve&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Organizations tend to move at a somewhat slower pace, so looking ahead at the developing threat landscape and pre-positioning appropriately is essential as we close the year’s budgeting cycle,” says Schatz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On his agenda is reviewing established sources such as the WEF Cybersecurity Outlook, the ENISA Threat Landscape and the ISF Threat Horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It helps to set expectations and allows for more realistic planning of risk controls over the next 12-36 months,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="11-close-the-communications-gap"&gt;11. Close the communications gap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs, boards and IT leaders must align around a shared language of resilience — which treats security as a business priority not simply a technical measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many boards still view security as a compliance or cost issue, while CISOs talk in terms of risk and continuity, according to Bee. “That communication gap creates blind spots that attackers can exploit,” he says. “As cyber risk becomes inseparable from business risk, boards and CISOs will be forced to collaborate more closely, translating technical threats into financial, reputational, and operational impacts that executives can act on.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should focus on storytelling, not just reporting. “This means connecting threat intelligence to business outcomes in clear, strategic terms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boards, in turn, need to treat cyber resilience as a competitive advantage, not a line item. “The companies that close the cultural gap between security and strategy will be the ones that recover faster, and inspire greater investor confidence when incidents inevitably occur,” Bee says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="12-deliver-outcomes-not-vibes"&gt;12. Deliver outcomes, not vibes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2026, execution will matter more than experimentation,” says Gallagher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, he will be adopting a disciplined approach that emphasizes transparency, governance, and measurable outcomes across the security program. “Every initiative will be measured by its ability to tie spend to ROI and tangible risk reduction,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI initiatives, in particular, are likely to come under real scrutiny to show outcomes and effective business use cases as the excitement and buzz of 2025 settles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It feels like 2026 is about making AI a business engine, not a science project,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How the Organizational Risk Culture Standard can supercharge your cybersecurity culture</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4112124/how-the-organizational-risk-culture-standard-can-supercharge-your-cybersecurity-culture.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You don’t lose most cyber battles to code. You lose them to culture: A rushed approval. A silent near-miss. A leader who shrugs at weak signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools don’t fix that. People do, when they understand risk, own it and act with discipline under pressure. That is what the &lt;a href="https://riskculture.org/"&gt;Organizational Risk Culture Standard&lt;/a&gt; (ORCS) gives you: A way to turn good intentions into daily behavior that defends trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats move fast. Your policies don’t. You work in VUCAD conditions: volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous and digitized. Static models lag. Judgment wins. Risk culture equips your team to interpret change, adjust in the moment and act with integrity when facts are partial and time is short.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-you-need-risk-culture-in-cyber"&gt;Why you need risk culture in cyber&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most post-mortems trace back to the exact cause: human drift. Someone knew but stayed quiet. Another acted alone. The solution isn’t more rules; it’s a mindset that sees risk as everyone’s job. Risk culture aligns values, incentives and decisions, reinforced by transparent governance. In VUCAD conditions, it shifts behavior from blind compliance to fast, ethical judgment, replacing box-ticking with honesty, accountability and informed action when it matters most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two payoffs stand out. First, faster detection through open reporting and psychological safety. Second, better choices under ambiguity because you balance taking risk with controlling it, which the standard calls dynamic risk equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-10-dimensions-translated-for-cybersecurity"&gt;The 10 dimensions, translated for cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ORCS framework defines ten dimensions. Treat them as a system. Each one is distinct; together they are complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership &amp;amp; governance.&lt;/strong&gt; Leaders set the tone, model the behavior and anchor accountability. If leaders treat cyber as only an IT issue, everyone else will, too. When leaders make risk-informed decisions visible, people copy them.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk intelligence &amp;amp; adaptive elasticity.&lt;/strong&gt; You read the environment and counter bias and stretch without breaking. In cyber, that means tuning playbooks to signals, not templates. You pivot while maintaining integrity and alignment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics &amp;amp; values.&lt;/strong&gt; Under real pressure, values decide. Clear principles stop corner-cutting, concealment and blame games when an incident bites.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuitive and analytical decision-making.&lt;/strong&gt; You blend instinct and evidence. Triaging alerts needs speed; approving data-sharing exceptions need rigor. Great teams shift gears without drama.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk appetite, tolerance and acceptance.&lt;/strong&gt; You draw the lines before the crisis. Which risks you pursue, which you cap and what you consciously accept. This removes guesswork and weak compromises at 2 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication &amp;amp; transparency.&lt;/strong&gt; People speak up early. Near-misses get surfaced and studied. Leaders share not only the what, but the why so the organization can act as one.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology &amp;amp; process integration.&lt;/strong&gt; Systems should amplify judgment, not replace it. Embed risk checks into workflows, dashboards and alerts so that doing the right thing is the easy path.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People development &amp;amp; engagement.&lt;/strong&gt; You teach cyber risk like a language. You build competence, confidence and ownership at every level. You reward proactive reporting and ethical decisions, not heroics.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alignment with frameworks.&lt;/strong&gt; You map culture to standards such as ISO 31000, COSO ERM, NIST, FAIR and/or ISO 27001 and keep alignment alive as laws and expectations shift. It shows credibility and keeps practice grounded.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change management, sustainability &amp;amp; continuous learning.&lt;/strong&gt; You treat culture as a product with releases, telemetry and upgrades. You monitor, adjust and reinforce until habits stick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="case-study-the-global-manufacturers-cultural-stress-test"&gt;Case study: The global manufacturer’s cultural stress test&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A global manufacturer spotted odd downtime in a supplier’s system and chose to treat it as a test of culture, not competence. The CEO’s message was simple: learn, don’t blame. Teams mixed data with gut instinct, warned the supplier early and acted within agreed risk limits. Regular updates built trust, while integrated tools helped people make sound calls fast. Afterward, both firms reviewed what worked, mapped fixes to ISO and NIST and shared lessons openly. The supplier later uncovered ransomware that had been contained before release, proof that a strong risk culture turns tension into trust and pressure into progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These dimensions are not posters. They are levers you pull every week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-culture-maturity-path-from-reactive-to-presilient"&gt;The culture maturity path: From reactive to ‘presilient’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ORCS describes five maturity levels that map cleanly to cyber realities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forget buzzwords. You need a ladder, not a slogan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1 — Ad hoc:&lt;/strong&gt; Heroics, silos and surprise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2 — Developing:&lt;/strong&gt; Pockets of progress; behavior uneven.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3 — Intermediate:&lt;/strong&gt; Roles defined, leaders walking the talk.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4 — Advanced:&lt;/strong&gt; Proactive learning, open reporting.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 5 — High-performing:&lt;/strong&gt; Presilience, adaptation without drama.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A global manufacturer raised overall risk maturity by focusing on moving weaker sites from level 2 to level 3, rather than chasing perfection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t jump levels. Build the muscles in sequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="embed-the-framework-into-cyber-operations"&gt;Embed the framework into cyber operations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diagnose the baseline. Blend data with stories: use pulse surveys, focused interviews and artifact reviews. Spot silence on near-misses, track how fast risk travels and reveal where incentives clash with values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Define risk appetite and tolerance for cyber. Set clear limits on data loss, downtime and third-party risk. Give leaders short, usable statements. Define and document boundaries so teams act consistently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Design reinforcement systems. Bake cultural checks into governance. Add a “risk culture” section to risk committee packs. Require a short ethics note on material exceptions. Tie role descriptions and performance criteria to ownership, reporting and follow-through. People mirror what you measure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Develop people and align incentives. Train judgment, not just controls. Run red-team tabletop exercises that test psychological safety as much as response time. Recognize those who surface fragile truths early. Avoid perverse incentives that reward short-term wins at the cost of trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drive continuous feedback. Build a feedback architecture: data → reflection → dialogue → redesign. After incidents and near-misses, run brief learning reviews that focus on conditions, not culprits. Share the lessons widely. Retire rituals that don’t move behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Done well, risk culture stops being a memo and becomes muscle memory. One construction case from the standard shows how embedded roles, shared language and system alerts kept projects on track after a sudden supplier collapse. That is culture in motion, not wishful thinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="measure-what-matters-kcis-for-cyber-risk-culture"&gt;Measure what matters: KCIs for cyber risk culture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t see culture, you can’t steer it. Build a short set of key cultural indicators (KCIs) that leaders will read and teams can influence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speak-up rate.&lt;/strong&gt; Percentage of staff who reported a suspected phishing email, control gap or near-miss this quarter. Rising is good; apathy is silent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to truth.&lt;/strong&gt; Median time from detection to disclosure to the proper forum. Faster beats perfect.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethical confidence index.&lt;/strong&gt; Brief survey signal on “I feel safe raising risk concerns” and “My leaders act consistently with stated values.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership risk messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; Count of substantive communications from executives that explain cyber trade-offs, appetite and lessons learned.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception hygiene.&lt;/strong&gt; Share of exceptions with clear ethical rationale, expiry and owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Layer these with the maturity scales in each dimension. Track progression by dimension, not just in the aggregate. Publish the trend. Use it in your board story, alongside familiar KRIs and technical metrics, so culture and control sit side by side. That’s how you turn measurement into momentum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A financial company published these alongside its patching stats. At first, investors raised eyebrows. Six months later, regulators called it exemplary transparency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="make-it-stick-from-projects-to-habits"&gt;Make it stick: From projects to habits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Culture fails when it lives in launch decks. It sticks when people feel two things: clarity and consequence. Clarity comes from leaders who model the behavior and name the trade-offs out loud. Consequence comes from systems that reward what you want and make the wrong path hard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Culture changes when lessons become reflexes: small, repeated actions that outlast the project plan. The companies that sustain high performance do one thing differently: they balance three cultural mindsets instead of leaning on just one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compliance gives structure and discipline to meet standards and follow the rules. It keeps the floor steady. Resilience accepts that things will go wrong and prepares people to recover fast, protecting trust when pressure hits. Presilience goes a step further. It builds foresight into the system, turning prevention and innovation into daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;True strength lies between compliance, resilience and presilience, where rules guide, recovery is natural and foresight continually drives progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make it stick by rewarding these everyday choices: the engineer who flags a weak control before it fails, the manager who turns a near-miss into a learning story, the board that asks, “What’s our next opportunity hidden inside this risk?” That’s how culture shifts from program to pattern and performance becomes sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adopt a simple rhythm:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarterly:&lt;/strong&gt; Refresh your culture dash; review signals and stories.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly:&lt;/strong&gt; Spotlight a lesson learned; show the change it drove.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly:&lt;/strong&gt; Ask one risk culture question in every leadership stand-up.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily:&lt;/strong&gt; Embed tiny friction, checklists, prompts and default settings that nudge the right action at the right moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tie it all to presilience, the capacity to anticipate, adapt and advance. You earn trust when you act fast and fair under stress. That trust outlasts the incident. It compounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="common-traps-and-how-to-avoid-them"&gt;Common traps and how to avoid them&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy theater.&lt;/strong&gt; Lots of documents, little behavior. Fix by testing policies through live simulations and learning reviews. Retire the brittle ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear-based messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; Fear spikes activity, then breeds avoidance. Replace it with clear appetite, ethical anchors and practical guidance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metric overload.&lt;/strong&gt; Fifteen dashboards, no decisions. Choose a small set of KCIs and KRIs that leaders can explain without notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech worship.&lt;/strong&gt; Tools matter, but judgment rules. Train bias awareness. Pair automation with human checks where the stakes are high.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-and-done change.&lt;/strong&gt; Culture erodes without reinforcement. Use the maturity model to plan the next level and resource it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-first-90-days"&gt;Your first 90 days&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 1–30.&lt;/strong&gt; Run a crisp baseline: short survey, six interviews, artifact scan. Identify three behavior chokepoints where risk signals die. Publish one page on findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 31–60.&lt;/strong&gt; Set cyber risk appetite and tolerance in plain language. Add culture questions to risk committee packs. Pilot two micro-nudges in priority workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 61–90. &lt;/strong&gt;Launch a leader-led learning ritual after incidents and near-misses. Add KCIs to the monthly cyber dashboard. Recognize two teams for raising challenging issues early.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A manufacturing group did precisely this. By day 90, the average incident disclosure time dropped from 9 days to 2. Nothing fancy; just culture, clarified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keep it public. Keep it human. Keep it moving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-payoff-you-can-take-to-the-board"&gt;The payoff you can take to the board&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you embed the Organizational Risk Culture Standard, you gain three edges:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed.&lt;/strong&gt; Signals move quickly; recovery accelerates.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality.&lt;/strong&gt; Bias checks sharpen judgment; appetite lines prevent overreach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust.&lt;/strong&gt; People speak up; leaders act consistently; customers believe you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A financial company saw this firsthand: internal detection doubled, external findings halved and regulator confidence soared. They didn’t just pass audits; they built credibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These gains compound. You stop paying the ignorance tax: silence, delay, reputational drag and start earning the compound interest of trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-move"&gt;Your move&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You win cyber by building a culture where people make sound choices when the facts are fuzzy and the clock is cruel. ORCS gives you the scaffolding: leadership that models, systems that reinforce and measures that matter. Use it to align appetite, accelerate learning and turn near-misses into better habits. That’s how you supercharge cybersecurity culture, protect trust when it counts and build a team that doesn’t just survive the storm; it reads the sky, sets the sails and makes speed.&lt;/p&gt;
