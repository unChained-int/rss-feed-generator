      <title>Cybersecurity leaders’ top seven takeaways from 2025</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4102893/cybersecurity-leaders-top-seven-takeaways-from-2025.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the last 12 months, security teams continued to walk a tightrope between moving fast to adopt new technologies and facing escalating threats fuelled mostly by the rise of AI. As the year comes to a close, CISOs reflect on some of the takeaways that have shaped the security landscape in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-ai-gave-defenders-more-muscle-power"&gt;1. AI gave defenders more muscle power&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If 2024 was the year AI crept into cybersecurity, 2025 was the year it took over, with Smartsheet CISO Ravi Soin describing the technology as being “transformational”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There isn’t a single company or single user across the globe that hasn’t really faced the effects of [AI] in one shape or another,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI has reduced manual work and tightened controls over large attack surfaces. It helped mapping controls to the data evidence in a faster way, Soin tells. “Before we were manually collecting evidence, we were making sure our systems were going through it. But now we can pull this together in a very efficient manner.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI gave security teams – and businesses more broadly – a huge productivity boost, reducing their reliance on external consulting and research firms, according to Calendly CISO &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yassir/"&gt;Yassir Abousselham&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re able to do a lot more. It’s like having the entire human knowledge in our pockets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-ai-forced-companies-to-rethink-their-security-strategies"&gt;2. AI forced companies to rethink their security strategies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Abousselham notes how the rapid rollout of AI forced companies to shift their resources to keep pace with the change, while maintaining safe product releases. He calls 2025 the “chaotic introduction of agentic AI”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think the industry was ready or expected the rapid developments of this technology, and how every single organization is trying their best to be a first mover and essentially moved all – or a good chunk – of their investment in just deploying and developing products and features around artificial intelligence. That trend impacted security … and forced us to refocus our investments, and in some cases, replan a lot of the priorities that we had already in place.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-ai-supercharged-attackers"&gt;3. AI supercharged attackers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same technology powering defenses allowed adversaries to move faster, target more precisely, and scale campaigns that used to require human effort. The contrast between attack styles has become increasingly stark. While some campaigns remain undetected for months and quietly move through networks to expand access and exfiltrate data, there are others that are executed in minutes, and attackers complete their objectives before alerts are triggered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Swifter attacks are being fueled by artificial intelligence. Threat actors are leveraging AI to automate reconnaissance, craft highly personalized lures, and generate audio and visual deepfakes that exploit human trust at scale,” Mandy Andress, CISO of Elastic, says. “The result is a growing convergence of technical and psychological attack surfaces that target the human link or use AI to rapidly bypass traditional signature-based detection and rule-based systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That convergence is already showing up in the most common entry points. Soin sees this happening directly in phishing and social engineering. “You used to detect a phishing email by spotting grammatical errors in an email or because a logo didn’t look right. Now you have perfectly crafted emails. You have deepfakes. You have systems that can be compromised no matter how sophisticated they are. It’s truly uncharted territory.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same trend has been playing out in tooling, according to Amit Jain, global head of cybersecurity and GRC services at HCLTech. Attackers are upgrading the sophistication of their code. “AI-led adversaries were the biggest emerging threat this year, using generative AI for generating evasive self-modifying malicious code, deep fakes, precision phishing, and automated exploit development.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-the-threat-actor-is-now-a-machine"&gt;4. The threat actor is now a machine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI-driven adversaries has fundamentally changed what a “threat actor” looks like. What used to be a human sitting behind a keyboard is now an automated system that never tires, never slows down, and constantly learns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As AI gets smarter and smarter, they’re learning about the defenses you have in place, coming up with counterattacks that can defeat your defenses, going back in time for the last 10 years of vulnerabilities that may still be exposed, and using them in creative ways to get at it,” Soin says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has pushed the threat landscape into entirely new territory. “We’re in very uncharted territory from a cyber perspective, where the notion of AI has made it easier for threat actors to become smarter in how they attack you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-non-human-identities-exploded"&gt;5. Non-human identities exploded&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As organisations raced to deploy AI agents, automation pipelines, and machine-to-machine workflows, Abousselham believes it also led to the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009316/how-cybersecurity-leaders-can-defend-against-the-spur-of-ai-driven-nhi.html"&gt;explosion of non-human identities&lt;/a&gt;. He explains how every AI agent, whether it’s an autonomous workflow tool, an API-driven integration, or an MCP client, now requires its own identity with permissions, access levels, and lifecycle management, and the pace is accelerating faster than most security teams are prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rise in machine identities has already driven significant investment, not just in human bandwidth, but in new solutions and technologies capable of managing identity operations at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a need for an acceleration in how we onboard, maintain, and manage these identities … we must ensure these agents are governed, managed, properly authenticated and authorized, and that we can deprecate them at the end of their cycle,” Abousselham says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this shift isn’t limited to AI agents alone. Andress says the industry has doubled down on fundamentals as identity sprawl grows, particularly around the configurations and controls that underpin both human and non-human access. “This includes protecting non-human identities, such as API keys, tokens, and service accounts, which have become common entry points for attackers,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-third-party-risk-took-centre-stage"&gt;6. Third-party risk took centre stage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Third-party attacks surged in relevance throughout 2025 as organizations expanded their technology stacks and adopted more SaaS platforms, AI tools, and automated integrations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076024/dreamforce-finds-salesforce-weathering-a-security-storm.html"&gt;recent breaches involving major service providers like Salesforce&lt;/a&gt;, Soin says high-profile incidents are a reminder that an organization’s risk surface extends far beyond its own perimeter. “When companies depend on third-party software, it becomes even more important for us to think through the stack of what that looks like and ensuring that enterprises are depending on technologies that have security at the forefront in what they do,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jain observes that 2025 marked a turning point in how organizations approached governance and vendor oversight, noting there was stronger alignment between compliance, governance, and resilience, supported by automation, advanced analytics, and continuous third-party assurance. “In essence, 2025 was the year when cybersecurity pushed itself to become a shared business responsibility rather than a siloed security function.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While stronger governance and automated oversight provide the framework, Jain emphasizes that security ultimately depends on the daily decisions of everyone in the organization. “True security comes from habit, behavior, and culture. Every click, every decision, every configuration, every third-party integration now carries weight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-regulatory-pressures-hit-the-board"&gt;7. Regulatory pressures hit the board&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Government oversight grew stricter in 2025. Regulations demanded faster reporting, tighter controls, and accountability at the senior leadership level, according to Jain. “Boards are no longer satisfied with compliance checklists. They expect measurable resilience, ROI in terms of risk optimization, demonstrated preparedness, and continuous reporting. This has made cybersecurity a strategic lever, influencing M&amp;amp;A decisions, supply chain partnerships, and even go-to-market business strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, international frameworks like IRAP, ISO, and NIST are being enforced more rigorously, says Soin. “Standards may not have changed as much as we think they have. But the enforcement of those standards is getting stricter. We’re seeing a lot more, as an example, customer contracts or regulations on expectations from customers, and for the right reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Microsoft-Gebäude USA" class="wp-image-4106301" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2662877349.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Microsoft hat angekündigt, dass sein Bug-Bounty-Programm ausgeweitet werden soll.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; bluestork – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberangriffe beschränken sich heutzutage nicht auf bestimmte Unternehmen, Produkte oder Dienstleistungen – sie finden dort statt, wo die Schwachstellen sind. Zudem werden die Attacken mit Hilfe von KI-Tools immer ausgefeilter. Vor diesem Hintergrund hat Microsoft seinen neuen Security-Ansatz „In Scope by Default“ auf der Black Hat Europe angekündigt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demnach kommt künftig jede „kritische Schwachstelle“ mit „nachweisbaren Auswirkungen“ auf die Online-Dienste von Microsoft für eine Prämie in Frage. Dies gilt sowohl für Code, den Microsoft verwaltet, als auch für alles, was von Dritten oder über Open Source bereitgestellt wird.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Den Angreifern ist es egal, wem der Code gehört, den sie auszunutzen versuchen”, schreibt Tom Gallagher, Vice President of Engineering beim Microsoft Security Response Center, in einem &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/12/in-scope-by-default" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blogbeitrag&lt;/a&gt;. „Der gleiche Ansatz sollte auch für die Sicherheits-Community gelten, die mit uns zusammenarbeitet, um wichtige Erkenntnisse zum Schutz unserer Kunden zu liefern.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ziel-ist-es-anreize-fur-die-forschung-zu-schaffen"&gt;Ziel ist es, „Anreize für die Forschung zu schaffen“&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gallagher betont, dass Microsoft „alles tun wird, was nötig ist“, um aufgetretene Probleme zu beheben. Er weist darauf hin, dass das Unternehmen bereits im Jahr 2024 im Rahmen seines Bug-Bounty-Programms und seiner Live-Hacking-Events mehr als 17 Millionen Dollar ausgeschüttet hat. Die veränderte Strategie werden die Berechtigung zur Förderung noch erweitern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Unser Ziel ist es, Anreize für die Forschung in den Bereichen mit dem höchsten Risiko zu schaffen, insbesondere in Bereichen, die von Angreifern am ehesten ausgenutzt werden“, erklärt der Microsoft-Experte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Förderung im Rahmen des Bug-Bounty-Programms umfasst nun:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft-eigene Domains und Cloud-Dienste: Sicherheitsforscher ohne Insider-Kenntnisse bei Microsoft werden ermutigt, sich gemäß vereinbarten Regeln auf die Infrastrukturen des Unternehmens zu konzentrieren.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Code von Drittanbietern, einschließlich Open Source: In Fällen, in denen es in diesem Bereich noch kein Bug-Bounty-Programm gibt, wird Microsoft nun eines anbieten. Die Identifizierung von Schwachstellen in Code von Drittanbietern kann dazu beitragen, die Messlatte für „alle, die sich auf diesen Code verlassen“, höher zu legen, so Gallagher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forscher können ihre Ergebnisse zur Bewertung und zur koordinierten Offenlegung auf einer &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Online-Plattform&lt;/a&gt; von Microsoft einreichen. Auf diese Weise werden Schwachstellen vertraulich gemeldet, um diese Probleme zu diagnostizieren und zu beheben, bevor sie öffentlich bekannt gegeben werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft und seine Partner befolgen die &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Regeln für verantwortungsbewusste Sicherheitsforschung&lt;/a&gt;, so Gallagher, die eine Vielzahl von Red-Teaming-Aktivitäten fördern. Dazu zählen&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schwachstellenbewertungen auf virtuellen Azure-Maschinen (VMs),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;das Testen der Spitzenkapazität,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Versuche, aus Systemgrenzen und gemeinsam genutzten Servicecontainern auszubrechen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;das Testen von Sicherheitsüberwachungs- und Erkennungssystemen, sowie&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;die Bewertung des bedingten Zugriffs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Regeln verbieten es &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495010/red-vs-blue-vs-purple-teams-so-trainieren-sie-effektiv-den-ernstfall.html" target="_blank"&gt;Red-Teams&lt;/a&gt; jedoch, Zugangsdaten zu verwenden oder darauf zuzugreifen, Phishing-Angriffe gegen Microsoft-Mitarbeiter zu starten oder Denial-of-Service-Tests durchzuführen, die übermäßigen Datenverkehr verursachen. Zudem ist es nicht gestattet, mit Speicherkonten zu interagieren, die nicht im Abonnement des Benutzers enthalten sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vor-und-nachteile-dieses-ansatzes"&gt;Vor- und Nachteile dieses Ansatzes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Ausweitung des Anwendungsbereichs ist nicht unbedingt neu, stellt Avakian von Info-Tech fest, „obwohl Cloud-Dienstleister (CSPs), Finanzinstitute und SaaS-Unternehmen engere Formulierungen veröffentlichen und viele Fälle durch Verhandlungen hinter den Kulissen regeln.“ Dem Experten zufolge hängt jedoch vieles nach wie vor stark vom guten Willen der Forscher und internen Ermessensentscheidungen ab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Der erweiterte Umfang von Microsoft ist etwas anders und könnte zu weniger Diskussionen führen, die Zeit kosten und zu Reibungen mit Forschern führen können“, so Avakian. „Außerdem sendet es ein besseres Signal: Wenn die Leute keine Disqualifizierung befürchten, sind sie eher bereit, Ergebnisse aus frühen Phasen einzureichen. Das ist großartig für Verteidiger und kann das Vertrauen in die Forschungsgemeinschaft stärken.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Analyst räumt jedoch ein, dass es schwierig werden könnte, was die &lt;a&gt;Menge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#_msocom_1"&gt;[MB1]&lt;/a&gt;  der Bug Reports betrifft. Resultat seien möglicherweise mehr Berichten von geringer Qualität und spekulative oder „nebulöse“ Ergebnisse, mahnt der Info-Tech-Spezialist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Das Modell kann nur funktionieren, wenn die Schwere der Probleme konsequent bewertet wird“, so Avakian. Ansonsten könnten Angreifer indirekt davon profitieren, dass die Verteidigerteams überlastet sind, und potenzielle Störsignale echte Warnungen Signale übertönen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztendlich „ist der Umfang wirklich eine Frage der Unternehmensführung“, ergänzt Avakian und weist darauf hin, dass Unternehmen ins Hintertreffen geraten, wenn Schwachstellenprogramme immer noch in erster Linie darauf ausgerichtet sind, Auszahlungen zu reduzieren, Risiken zu minimieren und das Image der Marke zu schützen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Microsoft signalisiert, dass operative Klarheit defensiver Unklarheit überlegen ist“, so Avakian. Allerdings funktioniert „standardmäßig im Geltungsbereich“ nur mit der entsprechenden organisatorischen Reife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Wenn Sie nicht bereits über eine starke Governance, Triage-Prozesse, konsistente Schweregradmodelle und technische Verantwortlichkeit verfügen, wird es problematisch“, führt der Experte aus. „Automatisierung, Anreicherung und erfahrenes menschliches Urteilsvermögen sind hier wichtiger denn je, und Microsoft scheint eindeutig in dieses langfristige Spiel zu investieren.“ (jm)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>No more orange juice? Why one ship reveals America’s maritime cybersecurity crisis</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105838/no-more-orange-juice-why-one-ship-reveals-americas-maritime-cybersecurity-crisis.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single vessel called the &lt;a href="https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/details/9564384" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Orange Star docks at Port Elizabeth in New Jersey,&lt;/a&gt; carrying 38,848 cubic meters of orange juice concentrate. One ship, arriving weekly, supplies orange juice used by all of the city’s major retailers. If Port Elizabeth’s systems went down tomorrow due to a cyber attack, 46 million consumers within the four-hour trucking radius would feel the impact within days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat is real. The recent government shutdown furloughed CISA and FEMA staff at a critical time of exposure and vulnerability. The legal framework that allowed threat intelligence sharing between government and industry? That expired on September 30th when Congress failed to reauthorize the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. And the malware? That’s already in place, pre-positioned by nation-state actors waiting for the right geopolitical moment to trigger it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what one might call the “perfect storm of vulnerability,” and it’s hitting US maritime infrastructure right now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-evidence-isnt-theoretical"&gt;The evidence isn’t theoretical&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/seattle-airport-cyberattack-ransomware-rhysida-95cd980a9f45112f0fdce488233eec9c" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hackers hit the Port of Seattle with ransomware&lt;/a&gt;, demanding $6 million and releasing sensitive data on the dark web when their demands weren’t met. But the real threat extends far beyond opportunistic ransomware actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Area Maritime Security Committee (AMSC) for Sector New York with the US Coast Guard, I see firsthand how maritime facilities are preparing for the new Title 33 CFR cybersecurity requirements that went into effect in July 2025. Some ports, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, have the resources and maturity to comply. They’ve been conducting penetration tests, red team exercises and tabletop drills for years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what about the other 2,300+ facilities regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA)?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider SeaPort Manatee in Florida — a facility that moved 11.8 million tons of cargo in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.seaportmanatee.com/2024/11/seaport-manatee-reports-record-fiscal-2024-activity-as-hurricane-recovery-advances/#:~:text=The%20newly%20released%20economic%20impact,percent%20from%20two%20years%20earlier." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;generating $7.3 billion in economic impact&lt;/a&gt;. They spent $97,500 on a cybersecurity assessment in June 2024, with 75% funded by a DHS &lt;a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/port-security" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FEMA Port Security Grant Program&lt;/a&gt;. That’s one facility doing it right. But while they were still recovering from Hurricane Milton damage, how many smaller facilities were scrambling to find even that level of funding?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Japan’s Port of Nagoya was hit by ransomware in 2023, originally attributed to the Russian-affiliated LockBit gang, the central computer system was compromised and cargo operations were suspended for several days. The 2021 Suez Canal blockage by the Ever Given — a physical incident, not cyber — caused an estimated $10 billion per day in stalled trade. Now imagine that disruption triggered deliberately by malware already embedded in port systems such as gantry cranes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="this-is-a-workforce-problem-not-a-vendor-problem"&gt;This is a workforce problem, not a vendor problem&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new regulations require all 3,000 MTSA facilities to designate a cybersecurity officer (why the Coast Guard named them CySOs and couldn’t just call them CISOs, I do not know). Finding hundreds of qualified people who understand both operational technology in maritime environments and cybersecurity is nearly impossible. Many facilities are looking at IT professionals who will require cross-training on maritime technology systems and assets with 30+ year life cycles. This is quite different from the capital expenditure write-off of a laptop every 3–5 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Especially concerning is the fact that thousands of CISOs are considering leaving their corporate roles because they’re tired of being used as scapegoats when breaches occur. Hopefully, some are now looking for side work as part-time contractors with maritime facilities, treating it as job-loss mitigation while doing something that gives them genuine job satisfaction. If hired, they would immediately see the benefits of their work improving the security posture of a port facility in their hometown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is our critical infrastructure protection strategy: exhausted professionals moonlighting because facilities can’t afford full-time qualified staff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-developers-and-security-teams-can-actually-do"&gt;What developers and security teams can actually do&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this and thinking, “I don’t work at a port, why does this matter?” then consider your own supply chain dependencies. Your company most likely delivers services using third-party solutions, many of which depend on maritime logistics you never even think about. The systemic risk that emerges from complex systems means a port shutdown doesn’t just delay Amazon deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, we couldn’t get toilet paper or laptops. Our supply chains were deeply disrupted by a health crisis. Now imagine that kind of pervasive disruption triggered deliberately, with government cybersecurity staff having been furloughed at a critical moment or no legal framework to safely share threat intelligence because Congress let it expire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three concrete steps for this quarter:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re responsible for critical infrastructure or provide services for core supply chain systems, conduct a realistic resilience assessment of what a 72-hour maritime disruption would mean for your operations. Not a theoretical risk assessment but a practical business continuity exercise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;For mid-sized facilities facing these requirements, budget between $20,000–$25,000 for penetration testing. Explore &lt;a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/preparedness/state-local-cybersecurity-grant-program" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FEMA’s State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program&lt;/a&gt; (SLCGP), though be aware these often have non-federal match funding requirements. Better yet, find ways for academia, private sector and public sector entities to collaborate, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.mtsisac.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MTS-ISAC&lt;/a&gt;, rather than forging ahead in isolation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If you’re a CISO considering what’s next in your career, consider that maritime facilities desperately need your expertise. This isn’t corporate security theater. This is mission-critical work protecting infrastructure that millions depend on. That you and your family depend on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-saber-rattling-is-getting-louder"&gt;The saber-rattling is getting louder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current geopolitical climate has maritime security at a heightened level of readiness for international conflict. If a nation-state wanted to discourage US intervention in some form of aggression in APAC, South America or elsewhere, the malware is already believed to be in place, ready to be triggered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my discussions as part of the AMSC, we workshop scenarios constantly. What counts as an incident when the MARSEC (MARitime SECurity) Level needs to be elevated from 1 to 2 for a cybersecurity threat? MARSEC Level 2 requires additional protective security measures for a period of time across nautical facilities and vessels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing that hasn’t happened yet, but for which we train constantly. The challenge is that anything compromising safety systems in a port would trigger a shutdown of the entire port. There’s an element of systemic risk to the complex ecosystem that ports support that includes rail, trucking, shipping, fuel or, yes, that weekly orange juice delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US Coast Guard has been granted fairly large powers of authority in the event of an incident. But those powers are compromised when CISA staff have been furloughed and threat intelligence sharing has lost its legal protection. We can expect asset owners and sector agencies to continue to collaborate, but they will be doing so with additional (and avoidable) risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="monday-morning-action-items"&gt;Monday morning action items&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I lived in Manhattan during the first COVID lockdowns. I saw SWAT teams with sniper rifles taking up positions on rooftops across from grocery stores. That was contingency planning that thankfully didn’t need to be activated. But it revealed something crucial: Anything that threatens the ability to procure basic necessities will rapidly escalate in ways we’d rather not contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The orange juice example isn’t about orange juice. It’s about what the Orange Star represents. A complex system held together by aging infrastructure that 3,000 facilities now need to better secure, with cybersecurity officers they don’t have, using grant funding that was stuck during the government shutdown, while the legal framework for threat sharing has expired and nation-state malware sits dormant in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What you should do Monday morning: Elevate the discussion around cybersecurity risk with elected officials, boards of directors and everyday citizens. Accept the mantra of incident response: it’s not a matter of if, but rather just a matter of when.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an information security professional who has worked in this industry for 30+ years and who has given birth to major ecommerce sites in the Web 1.0 dotcom bubble, building and protecting banks and critical infrastructure in the ensuing years, I am not optimistic. Do we have the gumption and grit to do what’s needed?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We must work together now with focus, conviction and verve, because the alternative is unthinkable. I mention the word “verve” because I feel there must be a creative energy to how we champion our collective resilience and how we defend our community, our democracy and our way of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no incident response plan for a perfect storm. Only preparation before it hits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The 5 power skills every CISO needs to master in the AI era</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105841/the-5-power-skills-every-ciso-needs-to-master-in-the-ai-era.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one global manufacturing client, an AI model flagged a potential breach pattern that turned out to be normal behavior from a test server. The system wasn’t wrong — but the humans stopped questioning it. It took a single analyst with strong data storytelling skills to realize the oversight and prevent a full production shutdown. That’s what separates automation from understanding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-shift-no-security-leader-can-ignore"&gt;The shift no security leader can ignore&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I began advising CISOs and cybersecurity leaders in critical industries, the conversations were about firewalls, audit checklists and incident response playbooks. Then automation arrived — and, soon after, artificial intelligence. Suddenly, everything we thought defined technical excellence began to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, AI has become both an equalizer and a differentiator. It accelerates detection, automates response and surfaces insights we couldn’t see before. But here’s the paradox: the smarter our tools become, the more human our differentiators need to be — with AI acting as a &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;force multiplier&lt;/a&gt; for skills like critical thinking and data fluency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why a &lt;a href="https://www.talentlms.com/research/skills-for-ai-powered-future" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new generation of power skills&lt;/a&gt; is emerging — the capabilities that will determine which cybersecurity professionals remain indispensable in the decade ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2030, nearly half of all cybersecurity tasks will be automated — but the leaders who thrive won’t be the ones coding faster. They’ll be the ones thinking deeper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-traditional-skill-sets-are-no-longer-enough"&gt;Why traditional skill sets are no longer enough&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CISO action item:&lt;/strong&gt; Run a 1-hour “AI Bias Audit” on your top 3 detection rules this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask:&lt;/strong&gt; “What data is missing? Who is underrepresented?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 40% of core job skills will change by 2030, driven primarily by AI, data and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For security professionals, this means that expertise in network defense, forensics and patching — while still essential — is no longer enough to create value. The real impact comes from how we interpret, communicate and apply what AI enables.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI doesn’t just speed up decisions — it reshapes them. When a model identifies an anomaly, we need humans who can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate it into business risk,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Challenge the model’s assumptions and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Communicate the findings clearly to leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s not a technical ability. That’s a power skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-5-new-power-skills-for-the-ai-era"&gt;The 5 new power skills for the AI era&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-data-fluency-and-analytical-thinking"&gt;1. Data fluency and analytical thinking&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is now &lt;a href="https://www.cegos.com/en/news-and-resources/blog-global-learning-and-development/learning-trends/generative-ai-power-skills" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inseparable from data science&lt;/a&gt;. Every alert, log and anomaly is a data problem first — and a security problem second. In my consulting work, I’ve seen teams fail not because their tools were weak, but because their analysts couldn’t interpret what the data truly meant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being data fluent means questioning the data, recognizing bias in models and turning analytics into narratives that drive decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-risk-literacy-and-governance-intelligence"&gt;2. Risk literacy and governance intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI introduces new risk categories — from algorithmic bias to model transparency and explainability. Future-ready CISOs must understand these challenges, not just from a compliance angle, but as part of strategic governance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging frameworks set the tone:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Executive Order on Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Risk literacy isn’t just about security controls — it’s about anticipating where technology, ethics and law intersect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-executive-communication"&gt;3. Executive communication&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve sat in &lt;a href="https://www.cegos.com/en/news-and-resources/blog-global-learning-and-development/learning-trends/generative-ai-power-skills" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;boardrooms&lt;/a&gt; where brilliant engineers failed to influence executives because their insights were lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the AI era, clarity equals influence. The ability to write, present and simplify complex concepts — especially when dealing with probabilistic AI outcomes — determines who gets heard and who doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective communication is no longer “soft.” It’s strategic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-cross-functional-collaboration"&gt;4. Cross-functional collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI doesn’t exist in silos — and neither should cybersecurity. The most successful programs today bring together:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data scientists&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Privacy officers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Operations leaders&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legal advisors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real-world impact: At a global energy provider with 40,000 endpoints, a joint AI threat modeling workshop between security and data science teams cut mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) for ransomware precursors from 14 hours to 4 hours — not through new tools, but through shared context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the tangible value of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-ethical-foresight-and-creative-thinking"&gt;5. Ethical foresight and creative thinking&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As AI blurs the line between automation and autonomy, human judgment becomes the final safeguard. Questions like “Should we?” will matter more than “Can we?”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Professionals who can anticipate unintended consequences — from biased AI outputs to over-reliance on automation — will be the ethical backbone of digital trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Empathy and creativity, once considered “soft skills,” are now among the hardest skills to automate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-dual-edge-of-ai-in-cybersecurity"&gt;The dual edge of AI in cybersecurity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI isn’t just transforming defense — it’s transforming offense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative models enable:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyper-targeted phishing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Automated reconnaissance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Synthetic identity attacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, AI-powered detection and response tools identify shadow IT, data leaks and persistent threats at unprecedented speed. But there’s a catch: AI amplifies both strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor data governance → model drift&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Incomplete context → false positives&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Without ethical and human oversight → disastrous decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why building the human layer of cybersecurity — judgment, ethics and context — is now mission-critical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, CISOs have been judged on the absence of incidents. But AI changes that metric. When algorithms take over detection and reporting, visibility doesn’t mean accountability. The challenge is shifting from preventing breaches to proving control — not through dashboards, but through narrative and governance. The CISO’s new dilemma is this: how do you lead when the system knows more than you do?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-the-future-ready-security-team"&gt;Building the future-ready security team&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three actions to take this quarter:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in power skills — not just tools.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Perform regular skill-gap analyses that include communication, governance literacy and data storytelling.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;AI can automate tasks, but not wisdom. Encourage continuous learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI evolves faster than any policy. Create programs for:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red-teaming AI systems&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Collaborative simulations across departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integrate disciplines. Combine cybersecurity, data science and business strategy. This multi-lens approach strengthens both resilience and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leadership-takeaways"&gt;Leadership takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translate technical insights into executive language.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Treat AI like a team member, not a tool.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reward curiosity, not only compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Build trust faster than you build automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="redefining-ciso-success-metrics"&gt;Redefining CISO success metrics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow’s CISOs will be measured less by incident counts and more by how effectively they align AI-driven security initiatives with business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New KPIs to consider:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;% of AI alerts translated into executive risk briefings&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cross-functional project velocity (security + data science)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ethical AI review completion rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Championing ethical innovation&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make AI ethics a standing agenda item in every risk review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transparency and accountability should be as central to cybersecurity as encryption and patching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-this-means-for-cyber-leaders"&gt;What this means for cyber leaders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest myth in security is that technical mastery equals longevity. In truth, the more we automate, the more we value human differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Success in the next decade won’t depend on how much code you can write — but on how effectively you can connect, translate and lead across systems and silos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I look at the most resilient organizations today, they share one trait: They see cybersecurity not as a control function, but as a strategic enabler. And their leaders? They’re fluent in both algorithms and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future of cybersecurity belongs to those who build bridges — not just firewalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is no longer a war between humans and machines — it’s a collaboration between both. The organizations that succeed will be the ones that combine AI’s precision with human empathy and creative foresight. As AI handles scale, leaders must handle meaning. And that’s the true essence of power skills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future of cybersecurity belongs to those who can blend AI’s precision with human expertise — and lead with both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="next-steps-start-this-quarter"&gt;Next steps: Start this quarter&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add AI ethics to your risk committee agenda&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pilot a joint security/data science sprint&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Measure your team’s “data storytelling” maturity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>How to create a ransomware playbook that works</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4106753/how-to-create-a-ransomware-playbook-that-works.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563507/what-is-ransomware-how-it-works-and-how-to-remove-it.html"&gt;Ransomware&lt;/a&gt; attacks continue to plague organizations, and they’re getting ever more sophisticated via tactics such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3825545/5-things-to-know-about-ransomware-threats-in-2025.html"&gt;double- and multi-extortion&lt;/a&gt; and the use of artificial intelligence to create more refined attacks, and the growth of the ransomware-as-a-service model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs and CSOs need to make it a priority to create a playbook for their organizations to better defend against such attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3842496/the-state-of-ransomware-fragmented-but-still-potent-despite-takedowns.html"&gt;ransomware remains a big cybersecurity threat&lt;/a&gt;. Security firm CrowdStrike, in its new State of Ransomware Survey, notes that ransomware readiness is lagging as cyber criminals “use AI across the attack chain to accelerate intrusion, encryption, and extortion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report, based on a global survey of 1,100 IT and cybersecurity decision-makers, shows that 76% of organizations are struggling to match the speed and sophistication of AI-assisted attacks. About half of the respondents cite &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4075912/ai-enabled-ransomware-attacks-cisos-top-security-concern-with-good-reason.html"&gt;AI-enabled attack chains as today’s greatest ransomware threat&lt;/a&gt;, and 85% say traditional detection is becoming obsolete against AI-enhanced attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to ransomware, most companies are still treating it like a distant threat until it hits. Then it’s chaos,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorhorwitz/"&gt;Trevor Horwitz&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at security company TrustNet. “A good ransomware playbook isn’t just documentation. It’s muscle memory. You have to train like you fight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are some key elements to consider for an effective ransomware approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="planning-and-tabletops-preparedness-begins-with-practice"&gt;Planning and tabletops: Preparedness begins with practice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any organization that doesn’t have a cohesive plan in place for how to handle ransomware threats is asking for trouble. Planning an overall strategy — encompassing tools, processes, and people — is vital for maintaining business continuity and minimizing financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without a plan in place, enterprises risk launching a disorganized and ineffective response to attacks, which can result in lost data, significant systems downtime, compliance issues, and damaged brand or reputation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key component of the planning process is to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2144047/mastering-the-tabletop-exercise-3-cyberattack-scenarios-and-how-to-plan-a-robust-response.html"&gt;conduct cybersecurity tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt; to simulate how teams would conduct themselves &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4069236/corporate-executives-exposed-to-cyber-attacks-talk-about-the-pitfalls-of-response-measures.html"&gt;during an actual ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. This enables organizations to test and improve their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829684/how-to-create-an-effective-incident-response-plan.html"&gt;incident response plan&lt;/a&gt; in a no-risk environment, with a focus on decision-making, communication, and establishing clear-cut roles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Tabletop exercises are where everything starts,” Horwitz says. “If your executive team hasn’t sat in a room and worked through a simulated ransomware attack, start there. You don’t want to be figuring out who has the authority to pay a ransom or issue a public statement in the middle of an actual breach. You want to know how fast legal, IT, and [communications] can work together. The pressure is intense, and the decisions come fast. So the playbook should guide those decisions, not just sit on a shelf.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4006349/operation-999-ransomware-tabletop-tests-cyber-execs-response.html"&gt;These exercises&lt;/a&gt; enable enterprises to “create and maintain a ransomware-specific incident response playbook that defines roles, containment processes, forensic collection procedures, and communications templates,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnotte/"&gt;John Otte&lt;/a&gt;, senior security consultant at technology consulting firm Resultant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Perform realistic tabletop exercises with legal, communications, IT, and executive stakeholders, at a minimum annually, to test decision-making,” Otte says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;Tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt; need to simulate real business disruption scenarios, not just technical failures, says &lt;a href="https://www.iansresearch.com/our-faculty/faculty/detail/george-gerchow"&gt;George Gerchow&lt;/a&gt;, CSO at security firm Bedrock Data and faculty member at IANS Research, a research and advisory firm. “Effective ransomware preparedness begins with practice, not panic,” he says. “The most valuable sessions include leaders from operations, legal, finance, HR, and communications, because these teams face the toughest decisions under pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staffing, skills, and training&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations continue to find that cybersecurity experts are in short supply, so staffing up teams is a challenge. That can be problematic for a ransomware strategy. Companies need to have a variety of skills in place, including expertise in incident detection and prevention, incident response, firewall configuration, and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also need to be equipped to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604803/security-awareness-training-topics-best-practices-costs-free-options.html"&gt;train all employees&lt;/a&gt; in how to help prevent ransomware attacks. This includes teaching them how to recognize, deal with, and report threats such as phishing emails, suspicious links, and questionable attachments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On the staffing side, you &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3846318/6-hard-earned-tips-for-leading-through-a-cyberattack-from-csos-whove-been-there.html"&gt;need people who know what they’re doing&lt;/a&gt;,” Horwitz says. “Not just cybersecurity folks, but people across legal, PR, and leadership. And not just headcount. You need readiness. A named incident commander. Someone with forensic skills. Someone who understands business risk and knows when to escalate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations often invest in tools before investing in people, and that’s backwards, Gerchow says. “Resilience relies on cross-functional preparedness, where employees understand not just what to do but why it matters,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises need to hold role-appropriate security training for users, including business leaders, IT teams, finance, etc., on realistic threats such as social engineering and malicious attachments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Business leaders should encourage ongoing training that connects cybersecurity risk to business continuity and reputation, Gerchow says. “It’s about building a culture where everyone, from the help desk to the boardroom, understands their role in maintaining operational integrity,” he says. “Regular awareness programs, role-specific response drills, and executive briefings help translate technical risks into business terms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prevention-steps"&gt;Prevention steps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises can invest in a range of technology solutions for both protection against ransomware attacks and remediation following an incident. Ransomware prevention requires a layered approach that includes regular software updates and patching, effective data and systems backups, and other cybersecurity tools such as firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and antivirus software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3520881/patch-management-a-dull-it-pain-that-wont-go-away.html"&gt;Patch management&lt;/a&gt; and vulnerability remediation are vitally important elements of ransomware defense, because ransomware attackers oftentimes exploit security flaws — &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074945/network-security-devices-endanger-orgs-with-90s-era-flaws.html"&gt;increasingly in security devices themselves&lt;/a&gt;. By addressing both of these areas, companies can proactively defend against ransomware threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Maintain a prioritized and trackable patching program that keeps exploitable exposure to a minimum,” Otte says. “Couple automated deployment of patches with human verification of high-risk systems, and regularly run scans to identify drift or skipped patches.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/568045/what-is-edr-endpoint-detection-and-response.html"&gt;Endpoint detection and response (EDR)&lt;/a&gt;, antivirus (AV) software, email security and phishing defenses, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4031659/windows-tips-for-reducing-the-ransomware-threat.html"&gt;identity and access management/MFA&lt;/a&gt; are also important pieces of any ransomware strategy, Otte says. “Use a modern EDR that contains behavior-based detection, rollback, and isolation capabilities rather than relying solely on signature AV,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the main ways ransomware attackers carry out their missions is via email. “From an IT security standpoint, the No. 1 attack vector is an email system,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/russbernst/"&gt;Russ Ernst&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Blancco, a provider of data erasure and mobile lifecycle diagnostics products. “Email security best practices must be implemented across the entire organization.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Email security can include advanced phishing filters to prevent common ransomware delivery mechanisms, Otte says. Sophisticated access management can help minimize threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Implement MFA anywhere you can, particularly for privileged accounts and remote access, and implement least-privilege principles to restrict opportunities to move laterally by attackers,” Otte says. “Keep admin credentials secured within a centrally managed secrets store, regularly rotate them, and don’t have shared local admin accounts. Insist on MFA before any privilege elevation. Track anomalous credential usage and apply detection against brute-force or lateral movement that employs privileged credentials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recovery-and-remediation"&gt;Recovery and remediation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a company experiences a ransomware attack, it needs to go into recovery and remediation mode as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. This includes recovering systems and data as well as repairing any damage affecting employees, customers, and the corporate brand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Create comprehensive recovery playbooks with system restore sequence prioritized and public communications strategies that target customers, regulators, and law enforcement,” Otte says. “Engage legal counsel, cyber insurance points of contact, and forensic responders in advance to make informed, timely, and notification requirement-appropriate determinations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a ransomware attack happens, “the remediation needs to be fast but precise,” Horwitz says. “You have to isolate systems immediately. Stop the spread. Kill off the malware’s communication paths. Bring in forensics to figure out how they got in. Because if you don’t understand the entry point, restoring from backup might just reintroduce the threat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises need to verify their backups before using them, Horwitz says. “I’ve seen companies restore clean-looking data only to discover the malware had been sitting dormant for weeks,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also need to ensure regular backup processes are in place, Ernst says. “It is important to regularly back up data and also to test these backups regularly,” he says. “Data that is regularly backed up in an offline environment will not be affected by a direct ransomware attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Access to this stored data should help minimize downtime, Ernst says. “Backups also help you rebuild infrastructure if you choose to pay the ransom and get encryption keys — only to find your data has been corrupted and made unusable. If the organization understands how long it takes to rebuild from a backup, then it can infer the estimated downtime from a ransomware attack,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations that might consider negotiating with ransomware gangs on ransom payments should also &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568817/the-ransomware-negotiation-playbook-adds-new-chapters.html"&gt;keep on top of the latest advice and tactics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recovery process is not just technical, Horwitz says, but also reputational. “If customer trust is shaken, you have to rebuild that fast,” he says. “That means communicating clearly, owning what happened, and explaining what’s being done. Law enforcement has to be notified. Regulators too. And the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4002175/8-things-cisos-have-learnt-from-cyber-incidents.html"&gt;lessons from that attack&lt;/a&gt; need to go right back into the playbook. What worked? What didn’t? Where did the team freeze up? That feedback loop is what strengthens your program.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having an effective internal and external ransomware communications plan is vital. “A ransomware attack communications strategy should be part of an organization’s general company playbook related to security breaches,” Ernst says. “It should spell out who must be informed — employees, customers, investors, other stakeholders — as well as how and when, what any communications will say, and who will do the communicating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The mistold story of a software failure that grounded 6,000 jets</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4106566/the-mistold-story-of-a-software-failure-that-grounded-6000-jets.html</link>

					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You should fly.  It’s safer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a fact. The odds are in your favor when compared to auto travel.  It’s not even close, we often remind the flight-fearing traveler.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet two of the smartest people I have known refuse to fly despite agreeing with this statistic. I think of them every time I board a flight.  It was no different when I returned from vacation on a JetBlue flight that retraced some of the northbound path taken by a JetBlue flight some weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flight in question was likely also filled with vacationers, an Airbus A320 journeying from Cancún International Airport in Mexico to Newark Liberty International Airport on October 30, 2025. As &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/travel/jetblue-flight-cancun.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported the next day in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, passengers aboard Flight 1230 were likely dozing off two and a half hours into the flight from the Mexican resort when they were jolted to attention by a sudden drop in altitude. When the unwanted acrobatic maneuver was over, 15 or more passengers involuntarily extended their vacations at hospitals in Tampa, where the JetBlue pilots managed a successful emergency landing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JetBlue representatives said the plane was taken out of service for inspection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are occasional commercial aviation mishaps, along with the rare disaster. For the flying public, reports of these mishaps are regular enough that a news story like this one can be safely tucked away until a broader pattern emerges. Understandably, had that been the end of the story, especially considering that it’s been Boeing planes subject to unwanted excitement of this variety since the 737 Max woes began. The plane involved in this JetBlue flight, as well as the one where I now occupied seat 23A, was an Airbus, thought to be less subject to what an FAA Expert Panel Report in February 2024 called “gaps in Boeing’s safety journey.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; plane, I thought to myself. What did the ensuing investigation uncover? Mechanical failure?  Software, perhaps even malware (though very unlikely)?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The “cause”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Times dutifully &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/business/airbus-software-a320-jets.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported the results&lt;/a&gt; of that investigation in a story they ran on November 28, 2025, the same day of my return flight to JFK. The story, adapted in part from an &lt;a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-11-airbus-update-on-a320-family-precautionary-fleet-action" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Airbus press release&lt;/a&gt;, opened with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The European airplane maker said a recent incident had shown that “intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The impact on the Airbus A320 fleet and the airlines that have deployed them would be widespread.  Potentially, 6,000 planes could be affected, with some requiring hardware changes, The Times reported after studying the extent to which the A320 has been chosen by airlines worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s a major impact, I thought. And then I read,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the issue can be addressed relatively quickly by reverting to a previous software version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hold on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“Single event upset”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, how often is this radiation impact occurring?  What’s the underlying physics? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out that there’s a history of science story to be told.  Nobel Prize winner Victor Hess discovered the existence of cosmic rays by measuring radiation levels at higher altitudes during balloon flights. That was before World War I. By the 1960s, it was a concern for crew health in the space program. A 1975 paper identified a satellite anomaly as a “single-event upset” (SEU) caused by radiation, and by 1979, it was understood that electronics could be disrupted at sea level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 1990, the FAA acknowledged that there was a risk to air travelers. The Airbus A320, a fly-by-wire aircraft with greater reliance on computers, was designed during a time when this phenomenon was well understood in the aeronautical engineering community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As software engineers at the time would have understood, addressing SEUs would require hardware and software features. ECC memory, for instance.  Sanity checks, too, in case a flipped bit would produce wildly out-of-range instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Features.  So why would rolling back to an earlier version of software be the remedy for the A320 late in 2025?  Wouldn’t features to address SEU from radiation in the current release also be present in earlier releases?  Or perhaps was there some new, innovative way to address SEU that would supersede the approaches taken in earlier releases?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Software life cycle management fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, the software quality engineer in me perked up. Somehow, the entire radiation part of the story seemed curiously irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was not to be the only one asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tony Fernandez is the founder of AirAsia Aviation Group. AirAsia’s current operations include a significant number of Airbus jets, and it has orders for almost 400 more Airbus aircraft. Fernandez expressed his concerns in a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It seems a bit bizarre; it is something it [Airbus] has to look at, it’s obvious it wasn’t tested,” Fernandez &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3334876/airasia-boss-says-bizarre-airbus-software-glitch-good-warning-sector?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told South China Morning Post&lt;/a&gt;. Fernandez speculated that Airbus might be stressed by commitments to meet its current goal of producing 820 planes in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from the eye-catching radiation storyline, the surface cause was described as a problem in the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC 2) software, which manages the aircraft’s pitch and roll by sending commands from the pilot’s side-stick to elevators at its rear. The software rollback involved restoring a version dubbed “L103,” replacing “L104.” Thales, developer of the ELAC hardware, told Reuters that the software involved was not its responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sudden nose-down movement experienced by the JetBlue passengers bound for Newark could also affect a wide variety of Airbus models, not only the A320:  multiple variations of the A319 and A321 series are also affected. &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/11/28/airbus-issues-major-a320-recall-after-flight-control-incident" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;One estimate&lt;/a&gt; speculated that more than 3,000 A320 jets were in the air around the time of the Airbus announcement. Picture those passengers on November 28, many equipped with WiFi on board, reading about this software vulnerability and mentally reworking their safety calculations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4 SDLC lessons. 2 inherent risks unbowed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond sensationalized “solar radiation” or “cosmic ray” talk, there’s a serious software development life cycle (SDLC) conversation to be had at Airbus. I’d list these four main takeaways, all of them familiar:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test engineering&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CI/CD and pipeline quality&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Observability&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply chain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notice that “coding” is not one of the takeaways. True, the L104 might have introduced a build packaging mistake, or a coding error, such as an accidentally deleted call to a service, misconfigured or misunderstood API parameters, or even a syntax error in the source code. These are all normal; a healthy SDLC addresses them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test engineering.&lt;/strong&gt; A good test harness could simulate the out-of-band telemetry that was supposed to invoke the range checks for ELAC.  Test harnesses need to be designed and built concurrently with software, not as a separate stage.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI/CD and pipeline quality.&lt;/strong&gt; You can add Change or Configuration Management to this group. Whether or not Airbus used CI/CD in its SDLC pipeline in L104, it will be moving in that direction. Something broke in the SDLC pipeline, which allowed this fundamental feature to “regress.”  The cause is unlikely to be a one-off.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observability.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m adding this one partly because I’m part of a small working group at IEEE working on a new version of the &lt;a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/2675.2/11839/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DevOps standard&lt;/a&gt; that will incorporate observability principles. The SEU is an excellent use case for observability because a test engineer can’t wait for a cosmic ray to strike, yet must ensure that a failure to respond to a critical SEU event can be observed. This involves more careful requirements engineering and understanding of the telemetry needed for critical features.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain.&lt;/strong&gt; While Thales may not have been involved in the problematic release of L104, the Airbus platform includes software and hardware from many suppliers. Integration across the computing supply chain presents challenges magnified by both the safety requirements and the desired product longevity. The apparent “Not our problem” response from Thales could indicate issues with joint information and problem-solving, or even limited visibility for the third-party risk management team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It could get worse, a lot worse. Lapses in any one of these four areas of the SDLC create opportunities for malware, a nightmare scenario for avionics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;AI to the rescue?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I worry that two inherent risks remain largely unmitigated: &lt;em&gt;complexity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;specialization&lt;/em&gt;. Managing the entire A320 feature set, or even its software bill of materials (SBOM / API-BOM), is a nontrivial undertaking. Consider that it is a product launched in 1987 with the need to support legacy hardware and software across a large installed base.  Both complexity and specialization will march steadily toward greater opacity, challenging attempts at traceability, transparency and manageability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No doubt Airbus, like the rest of us, will bring AI on board to help out — perhaps in L105. This will add both to the specialties needed and to the plane’s overall complexity.  Considering public trepidation over AI generally, at what point will more travelers feel the odds are no longer in their favor?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Demystifying risk in AI</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4106574/demystifying-risk-in-ai.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the facts about the importance of Artificial Intelligence, for several months, I have been delving into this topic, but with caution, seeking to understand the key point of how we can protect applications based on Gen AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are living in times when AI has been the central theme in all areas that can provide benefits to organizations and end users. In addition to adding benefits to protection and anticipation in detecting cyber threats, whether with threat intelligence, incident response and EDR, SOAR solutions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the question we must ask is how much we are looking at the risks of this emerging technology. As AI gains traction through the use of solutions like ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Meta.ai, Copilot, Gemini, Grok, among other SaaS-based solutions, it is a fact that AI is invading and taking over our routine. Those who do not adapt to this technology may be considered a piece off the board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s to record meetings and create automated summaries with Hynote.ai, or to prepare a Cyber Risk Management plan, we really have to recognize the speed and agility that AI provides to daily tasks. We already see that in some companies, where an employee decides to change jobs, the position may no longer be replaced, and the organization considers conducting studies evaluating the feasibility of replacing certain tasks with AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-importance-of-understanding-the-risks-behind-ai"&gt;The importance of understanding the risks behind AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here comes a point of concern that perhaps some professionals are not noticing. Are we being dominated by AI? Perhaps the answer may be “Yes,” “No” or “Maybe.” However, it will depend on the degree of visibility we have of this technology; the reality is that there is a danger behind it, and so our job is to know how to prepare to remediate such risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should we presume where we should fit professionally and how we should prepare to maintain our employability? Given that risks of hallucinations are still feasible and occur in AI solutions, the answer to a given question may not be accurate, as the existing methods behind diffusion models used in AI training utilize code generation techniques such as “transformers” in LLMs used by most AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude. For now, they still have limitations to validate a certain piece of data before providing the answer to the question that was entered by the requester (end user, API, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means and indicates that it is still necessary to consider the human factor to evaluate certain responses before providing a decision that may involve relevant decision-making in the corporate and human context, such as the result of an analysis of a medical diagnosis still requires an evaluation by a specialist, or in the case of a quantitative risk assessment of a critical system. In fact, it is a point to think about!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another important question to be asked is “how far should we limit and trust an AI solution?” Certainly, as mentioned above, many results can be positive, but remembering that every organization should think and maintain caution with privacy, bias, fairness and transparency risks through the data provided, among other points, which have raised the attention of information security professionals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Basically, the execution process of an AI model is composed of 3 phases:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data that is inserted in a request.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This data is evaluated by a training model that involves an entire architecture.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The result of the information that will be delivered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From an information security point of view. That is the point that we, information security professionals, must judge in the scope of evaluation from the perspective of data security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the market, there are already frameworks such as &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework"&gt;NIST RMF AI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://safety.google/cybersecurity-advancements/saif/"&gt;SAIF Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/42001"&gt;ISO 42001,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/07/10/introducing-the-csa-ai-controls-matrix-a-comprehensive-framework-for-trustworthy-ai"&gt;AI Control Matrix (AICM)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/ai-model-risk-management-framework"&gt;AI Model Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt; from Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), in addition to &lt;a href="https://atlas.mitre.org/"&gt;MITRE ATLAS&lt;/a&gt; for the Threat Intelligence line and &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/"&gt;OWASP Top 10 LLMs&lt;/a&gt; for security in AI application development, which presents the main known vulnerabilities in the AI/ML field, which I intend to explore in another article.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have particularly been studying NIST RMF AI and the AI Model Risk Management Framework from CSA, and in my view, they are effective in helping to map and add AI/ML solutions to the scope of the organization’s Cyber Risk Management program. These frameworks help to understand and map the AI applications used, address risks, impacts and damages that can occur with the use of this technology in the corporate context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="about-the-use-of-nist-ai-rmf-and-ai-control-matrix-aicm-frameworks"&gt;About the use of NIST AI RMF and AI Control Matrix (AICM) Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making an agenda about the most popular frameworks, NIST AI RMF 1.0 focuses on looking at the group of people, organization and the ecosystem involved. In which they are divided into phases of&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govern (cultivates a risk culture)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Map (context of identified risk and asset classification)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Measure (identifies, assesses and mitigates risk)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Manage (risks are prioritized according to impact)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This model allows integration with &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework"&gt;NIST CSF&lt;/a&gt; for the lens of cybersecurity controls. The most interesting thing about this is that the framework is free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another model that I cannot fail to mention is the AI Control Matrix (AICM), which contains 243 control objectives divided into 18 security domains and allows evaluating all security pillars of an AI solution, specifically in a cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/ai-controls-matrix"&gt;AICM&lt;/a&gt; is integrated with AI-CAIQ, which covers frameworks including BSI AIC4 Catalog, NIST AI RMF and ISO 42001. Any robust AI solution needs large processing and energy, which can only be found in data centers. For this reason, we have seen large investments by big techs in the expansion of new data centers in all regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, deeply understanding cloud concepts and shared responsibilities is fundamental to implement an AI solution with precision, securely and that satisfies the business, leveraging the organization’s capacity against competition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have been doing some research on GenAI and especially studying these frameworks. In view of this, characterizing and visualizing the great challenge for us, cybersecurity professionals, is to establish the relevance of the connection between the teams involved in an AI project. Therefore, the connection is a priority for the project’s success and, therefore, we should not neglect the involvement of the areas of governance, cyber risk, ethics, regulatory and compliance, cybersecurity, data scientists, AI and ML developers, human Resources and infrastructure and IT operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cybersecurity-professionals-need-to-be-trained"&gt;Cybersecurity professionals need to be trained&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another great challenge, which I emphasize, is that cybersecurity professionals need to be trained in this AI/ML technology, understanding the technical aspects of architecture, training models used, techniques such as &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation?hl=en"&gt;RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)&lt;/a&gt; that propose improvements in the model, and the application of the cybersecurity strategy to be judged. The eyes of the CISO and the cybersecurity team and other fronts involved must look at the importance of controls within these areas:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Model&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Application&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Assurance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Governance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="looking-at-the-shared-responsibility-perspective-in-cloud"&gt;Looking at the shared responsibility perspective in cloud&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another factor to be considered in scope: I reinforce the &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/security/shared-responsibility-shared-fate"&gt;shared responsibility&lt;/a&gt; of AI applications in a cloud environment. The security principles of GenAI models and respective applications must consider how the AI application model will run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, I highlight some crucial points to establish &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility"&gt;shared responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; in the cloud:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GenAI as an application (Public, SaaS)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;GenAI as a platform (IaaS or PaaS)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Build your own AI application (IaaS, on premises).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this model, with the help of the frameworks mentioned above, it will be possible to map, order and manage risks in the AI strategy adopted regarding access control for data and training models, data management and training, prompt controls, model development, model inference, model monitoring and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="thinking-outside-the-box"&gt;Thinking outside the box&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the key point I wish to awaken readers in this article is to lead them to think about how we cybersecurity professionals are observing the risks and impacts in our environment, and how to prepare to evaluate such GenAI solutions in our realistic world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have particularly been exploring some of these known models in a cloud environment (SaaS), but I have been having a lot of fun with the Anthropic solution (claude.ai). In this model, it is possible to build robust solutions with code; you just have to be creative. As an example, I requested that it create a complete Cyber Risk Management (GRC) solution and suggested comparing it with some solutions on the market and meet best practices such as PCI-DSS, NIST, CRI, ISO 27001, etc. So that the solution created the entire back-end, only missing the front-end creation. A project that could take months can be reduced to a few months or weeks, depending on the investment and effort of the workforce involved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="certifications-that-can-add-value-to-a-career"&gt;Certifications that can add value to a career&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, as I had the opportunity to participate as a contributor to the review program for the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) recently launched new certification, &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/taise"&gt;Trusted AI Safety Expert (TAISE)&lt;/a&gt;. I definitely recommend it for those who are interested in understanding and exploring the architecture and main protection mechanisms in AI/ML solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, taking into account other certifications in this area, I have also been exploring and recommending &lt;a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/aaism?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=aaism&amp;amp;utm_term=cert_na_acq_branded_ext&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22940868601&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_A9K9wACMjWJDefWgA6HQuljaVc"&gt;ISACA’s AAISM&lt;/a&gt; certification material, which in turn is very interesting from the point of view of risk governance and security in AI/ML. Nevertheless, &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/education/taise"&gt;TAISE&lt;/a&gt; brings a more comprehensive root in the technical scope that also incorporates risk management and governance in cloud environments, which is the real world. AI needs large processing and the ideal environment to run is the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, both complement each other and it is up to the professional to evaluate the best alternative and direction to follow. As the wise proverb says: “Do not abandon wisdom and knowledge, and it will guard you; love it, and it will protect you.”&lt;/p&gt;
