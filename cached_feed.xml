      <title>Why can’t enterprises get a handle on the cloud misconfiguration problem?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4083736/why-cant-enterprises-get-a-handle-on-the-cloud-misconfiguration-problem.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I wrote about how &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/564399/cloud-security-configuration-errors-put-data-at-risk-new-tools-can-help.html"&gt;cloud security configuration errors&lt;/a&gt; were putting enterprise data at risk. Amazon storage buckets were being left open to the public left and right, with millions of sensitive records exposed. Companies were new to the whole cloud thing, and cloud providers weren’t making it easy to lock everything down the way it should be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d think that by now enterprises should have their cloud assets locked down. Shouldn’t they?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they still don’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to an April &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2025/04/03/the-state-of-cloud-saas-security-essential-statistics-and-insights"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by Qualys, 28% of organizations surveyed had a cloud or SaaS-related breach in the past year, 24% said that misconfigured services posed the biggest risk to their cloud environments in third place after human error and targeted cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys also looked at 44 million virtual machines hosted in the public clouds, and found that, on AWS 45% had misconfigured resources, on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 63% had misconfigured resources, and 70% had misconfigured resources on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity company also found that 63% of publicly accessible VMs had no encryption on attached EBS storage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="more-tools-more-opportunities-for-misconfiguration"&gt;More tools, more opportunities for misconfiguration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of SaaS tools that companies are using just expands the opportunities to make configuration mistakes. Data on 4.7 million Blue Shield California members was recently &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970155/lesson-from-huge-blue-shield-california-data-breach-read-the-manual.html"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; due to a misconfiguration in Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have handed us a problem,” says Andrew Wilder, CSO at Vetcor, a national network of more than 900 veterinary hospitals. “By default, everything is insecure, and you have to put security on top of it. It would be much better if they just gave us out-of-the-box secure stuff. Would you buy a car that doesn’t have locks? They wouldn’t even sell that car.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This security gap is what allows third-party vendors to exist, he says. “You should be building products — and I’m talking to you, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon — that are secure by design, so you don’t have to get a third-party tool. They should be out of the box secure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building an in-house security is not an option at Vetcor and the company is using the native tools provided by the hyperscalers. “And for us, right now, that’s good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stop-reassess-reconfigure"&gt;Stop. Reassess. Reconfigure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, according to Ayan Roy, EY Americas cybersecurity competency leader, the highest number of breaches were caused by shared cloud repositories. “That’s where we saw the maximum amount of data exfiltration,” he says. “A lot was from shared cloud stores and SaaS applications.” That’s despite the fact that the clients have cloud security blueprints and governance processes and it is because of shadow IT, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations are turning something on but not configuring all the security features, not turning on all the logging and monitoring, not turning on MFA, not locking down access. “Business wants to go quickly and time to value is absolutely important.” But they do not include the cybersecurity teams on these decisions and that is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Cyber becomes an afterthought. If they’re in the right conversation, they can do things more proactively instead of doing things retroactively.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One proactive measure that any company can take is to drive more awareness of enterprise-approved, secure platforms. That might require better communication or additional training to ensure that employees don’t go off and use insecure systems when secure options are available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another blind spot comes up during mergers and acquisitions, he says. “Be proactive in acquisitions,” says Roy. “Do the due diligence and account for that, and make sure you have the right investment plan for cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-cloud-configuration-mistakes"&gt;Top cloud configuration mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Scott Wheeler, cloud practice lead at Asperitas, the bigger the organization or the more regulatory oversight it faces, the fewer cloud configuration errors it will see. “But if you get to the bottom of the Fortune 1000, say, if you’re a manufacturing company and the implications of making a mistake are perceived not to be so huge, and they don’t have regulators hovering over them, they might be fast and loose. That’s where you see errors happening.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the smallest organizations have tremendous problems since they don’t have the staff or the tools to manage configuration risks. This includes exposed storage buckets or web services, excessive privileges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The whole concept of zero trust is predicated on the fact that you can lock down access to the minimum of what you need,” says Wheeler. “But that’s hard to do.” People often increase permissions during development and don’t put them back when things go into production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest mistake that Wheeler sees is that databases or other cloud assets don’t communicate over secure private networks. “A lot of times, out of the box, those services don’t have that,” he says. “It takes some work to configure it so that it’s strictly private network traffic to my private cloud environment or my on-prem environment. That’s a huge one, and we see a lot of hacks with that — and a lot of compromises on internal environments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lack of multi-factor authentication is another risk as MFA helps protect cloud environments against risks such as leaked credentials. Lack of encryption is another concern, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/news-centre/press-releases/thales-2025-global-cloud-security-study-reveals-organizations-struggle" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt;, only 51% of sensitive cloud data is encrypted, and only 8% of enterprises encrypt 80% or more of their cloud data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-tips-for-cloud-configurations-to-reduce-data-exposure"&gt;9 tips for cloud configurations to reduce data exposure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-implement-multi-factor-authentication-everywhere"&gt;1. Implement multi-factor authentication everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Require MFA for all cloud access, not just some users. The reason that so many companies are reporting data breaches involving their Salesforce instances is that they didn’t have MFA properly set up and configured for their user accounts, allowing adversaries to take over user accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-default-to-private-networks-for-all-services"&gt;2. Default to private networks for all services&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Configure databases and cloud services to communicate only over private networks, not the public internet. According to Scott Wheeler at Asperitas, many services don’t default to this option and is the top misconfiguration that he sees in data breach investigations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-encrypt-sensitive-data-at-rest-and-in-transit"&gt;3. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only 51% of sensitive cloud data is encrypted, according to Thales. Today, encryption should be the default for all new and existing resources. And with quantum computing on the horizon, enterprises should already be using quantum-proof encryption algorithms to defend against harvest-now, decrypt-later attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-apply-least-privilege-access-controls"&gt;4. Apply least-privilege access controls&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Giving users and systems access to the minimum possible resources is a massive headache. And when additional privileges are granted for a particular reason, they’re often not downgraded again when the need passes. But least privilege is a cornerstone of modern zero trust security principles, and overprivileged accounts can easily lead to data losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-use-infrastructure-as-code-for-all-changes"&gt;5. Use infrastructure as code for all changes&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When administrators or users make changes to cloud configurations in the cloud management consoles, it’s difficult to track those changes and to revert them if something goes wrong. Plus, humans can easily make mistakes. The solution experts advise is to adopt the principle of “infrastructure as code” and use configuration management tools so that all changes are checked against policies, tracked and audited, and can easily be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-scan-for-misconfigurations-continuously"&gt;6. Scan for misconfigurations continuously&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it’s not enough to check that configurations are set currently when the cloud assets are first set up. Companies need to make sure that they don’t change. Cloud providers offer some native tools to help with this, and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/657138/how-to-choose-the-best-cloud-security-posture-management-tools.html"&gt;cloud security posture management&lt;/a&gt; tools can fill in the gaps or provide multi-cloud monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-lock-down-storage-buckets-and-disable-public-access"&gt;7. Lock down storage buckets and disable public access&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unsecured Amazon S3 buckets were all the rage with hackers a few years ago — and they are still a problem for companies. According to Tenable’s analysis of cloud environments, 9% of publicly accessible cloud storage contains sensitive data. Use bucket policies and access controls to ensure storage is private by default, and if you change its availability to public for testing or some other reason, make sure to make it private again when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-enable-comprehensive-logging-and-monitoring-for-all-deployments"&gt;8. Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring for all deployments&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies will often have monitoring for major cloud services, but shadow IT deployments are left in the dark. This is less a technology problem than a management one and can be addressed by better communications with business units and a more disciplined approach to deploying technology on an enterprise-wide level. With the rapid pace of technological change, this is harder to do but also more important, as AI and other new cloud services may touch sensitive data and processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-start-secure-from-day-one"&gt;9. Start secure from day one&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Build security into your cloud architecture from the beginning — it’s much harder to retrofit later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-ai-solve-every-problem"&gt;Will AI solve every problem?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vendors are promising that AI will make security easier, cheaper, and more effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But will generative AI really solve the cloud configuration problem?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It could, says Vetcor’s Wilder. “But it’s not going to happen as quickly as people are saying. I really think agentic AI has the possibility to enhance what security teams are doing, to alleviate the lack of resources we have. But there’s a lot of organizational change management that goes into that as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Business continuity and cybersecurity: Two sides of the same coin</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086135/business-continuity-and-cybersecurity-two-sides-of-the-same-coin.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As someone who has spent over six years in the trenches of IT operations at Amazon, managing critical infrastructure that cannot afford downtime, I’ve witnessed firsthand how the convergence of cyberthreats and business continuity has fundamentally changed the game for executives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 3 am call that every CISO and CIO dreads isn’t just about a server crash anymore. It’s about sophisticated threat actors who understand that disrupting your operations can be more profitable than stealing your data. After managing IT infrastructure for one of the world’s largest companies and responding to countless incidents, I can tell you that the traditional approach to business continuity planning is dangerously outdated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-5-4-million-question-every-executive-must-answer"&gt;The $5.4 million question every executive must answer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach report, the &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;average cost of a data breach has reached $4.88 million globally&lt;/a&gt;, with business disruption accounting for the largest portion of these costs. But here’s what keeps me up at night: These figures don’t capture the full picture of what happens when cybercriminals specifically target your business continuity infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During my tenure as an IT support engineer at Amazon, I’ve seen how quickly operational disruptions cascade through interconnected systems. When attackers target your disaster recovery sites, backup systems and the very tools you rely on to restore operations, the financial impact multiplies exponentially. The question isn’t whether your organization will face a cyber-induced business disruption; it’s whether you’ll survive it with your reputation and market position intact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-traditional-business-continuity-plans-fail-against-modern-threats"&gt;Why traditional business continuity plans fail against modern threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve implemented change management processes in environments requiring 99.99% uptime and I can tell you that most business continuity plans were designed for a different era. They assume that your backup systems, communication channels and recovery procedures will be available when you need them. Today’s threat actors specifically target these assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Veeam Ransomware Trends Report revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.veeam.com/ransomware-trends-report-2023?ad=in-text-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;93% of ransomware attacks target backup repositories&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t coincidental. Cybercriminals understand that by compromising your recovery infrastructure, they maximize their leverage and your desperation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From my experience managing IT assets and coordinating incident responses, I’ve learned that the most dangerous assumption executives make is that cybersecurity and business continuity are separate disciplines. They’re not. They’re two sides of the same operational coin and treating them separately creates the vulnerabilities that sophisticated attackers exploit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-human-factor-your-biggest-asset-and-greatest-risk"&gt;The human factor: Your biggest asset and greatest risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having trained numerous engineers and served as an escalation point for complex technical challenges, I’ve observed a critical pattern: human behavior under pressure consistently undermines even the most sophisticated technical controls. When your primary systems are down and executives are demanding immediate restoration, your team will take shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’ll use personal devices to access company systems. They’ll share credentials to speed up recovery processes. They’ll bypass security protocols to restore operations quickly. This isn’t a training problem; it’s a human nature problem that requires systematic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report confirms that &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;68% of breaches involve a human element&lt;/a&gt;. During crisis situations, this percentage increases dramatically as stress and urgency override security awareness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-resilient-infrastructure-lessons-from-high-availability-environments"&gt;Building resilient infrastructure: Lessons from high-availability environments&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Implementing network security protocols and backup solutions in Amazon’s demanding environment has taught me that resilience requires a fundamental shift in thinking. You cannot simply add cybersecurity measures to existing business continuity plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You must architect your entire continuity strategy around the assumption that your primary systems will be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means implementing network segmentation that isolates critical business functions from general corporate networks. When attackers gain access to email systems or file shares, they shouldn’t automatically have pathways to manufacturing controls or financial systems. &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST’s Zero Trust Architecture guidelines&lt;/a&gt; provide a framework, but implementation requires deep understanding of your operational dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your backup and recovery systems need their own security considerations. I’ve seen organizations invest millions in backup infrastructure only to discover that attackers had persistent access to their recovery environments for months. This requires implementing offline backup strategies, maintaining air-gapped recovery environments and regularly testing restoration procedures under simulated attack conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-cloud-paradox-opportunity-and-vulnerability"&gt;The cloud paradox: Opportunity and vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloud services present both opportunities and challenges for business continuity planning. While platforms like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud offer geographic redundancy and professional security management, they also create dependencies on external providers and internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Uptime Institute Global Data Center Survey found that &lt;a href="https://uptimeinstitute.com/resources/research-and-reports/uptime-institute-global-data-center-survey-results-2023" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;80% of data center outages could have been prevented through better processes and training&lt;/a&gt;. In cloud environments, you’re dependent on your provider’s processes and training, which creates a different risk profile that many executives underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="integration-where-most-organizations-fail"&gt;Integration: Where most organizations fail&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective business continuity planning must integrate cybersecurity incident response from the very beginning. This means having communication protocols that work even when primary networks are compromised, decision-making processes that account for ongoing security threats and recovery procedures that don’t inadvertently reintroduce vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach of focusing on restoring operations first and investigating security issues later is no longer viable. Organizations need to be able to conduct forensic analysis while simultaneously working to restore services. This requires specialized tools, trained personnel and procedures that balance the urgency of business recovery with the need to preserve evidence and prevent further compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="testing-the-reality-check-most-executives-avoid"&gt;Testing: The reality check most executives avoid&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regular testing becomes even more critical when cybersecurity threats are factored into the equation. Organizations need to conduct exercises that simulate not just technical failures, but active attacks on their recovery infrastructure. These tests should include scenarios where primary communication channels are compromised, key personnel are unavailable and recovery systems themselves are under attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/white-papers/sans-2024-detection-response-survey" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SANS 2024 Detection and Response Survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that organizations that conduct regular tabletop exercises recover 50% faster from actual incidents. But tabletop exercises aren’t enough. You need red team exercises where security professionals attempt to disrupt business continuity procedures using the same tactics that real attackers might employ.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-executive-imperative-act-before-the-crisis"&gt;The executive imperative: Act before the crisis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The integration of cybersecurity and business continuity planning will only become more important as organizations become increasingly dependent on digital infrastructure. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and internet of things devices create new attack surfaces that must be considered in continuity planning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key to success lies in recognizing that cybersecurity and business continuity are not separate disciplines that occasionally overlap. They are fundamentally interconnected aspects of organizational resilience that must be planned, implemented and managed as a unified strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As executives, you have a choice: Invest in integrated cyber-resilient business continuity now or explain to your board, customers and shareholders why your organization couldn’t maintain operations when it mattered most. The threat actors are already making their choice. The question is, what’s yours?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <title>Nikkei’s Slack breach leaks sensitive data from more than 17,000 users</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4086100/nikkeis-slack-breach-leaks-sensitive-data-from-more-than-17000-users.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Japanese media company Nikkei has confirmed that a security breach of its Slack accounts has potentially leaked highly sensitive information from more than 17,000 of its users. Consultants point to the incident as yet another reminder of the dangers when non-corporate devices are allowed to access confidential corporate data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An employee’s personal computer was infected with a virus, leading to the leakage of Slack authentication credentials. It is believed that this information was used to gain unauthorized access to employee accounts,” Nikkei said in &lt;a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/news/announcements/1394.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a published statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The incident was identified in September and countermeasures such as changing passwords were implemented. Potentially leaked information includes the names, email addresses, and chat histories for 17,368 individuals registered on Slack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei statement added “Considering the incident’s significance and to ensure transparency, we voluntarily reported it to [Japan’s] &lt;a href="https://www.ppc.go.jp/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Personal Information Protection Commission&lt;/a&gt;. No leakage of information related to sources or reporting activities has been confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity consultant &lt;a href="https://formergov.com/directory/brianlevine" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a former federal prosecutor who today serves as executive director of FormerGov, a directory of former government and military specialists, stressed that this is part of an ongoing trend of Slack breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is often increased risk when employees or contractors access company resources from non-company-managed devices. Recent attacks against Okta, MGM Resorts, and others have been linked to such unmanaged access,” Levine said, adding that last year, “an attacker exfiltrated more than [1 terabyte] of internal data from Disney’s Slack environment when a contractor had accessed Slack from an unmanaged device, bypassing monitoring tools.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/erik-avakian" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group, noted that one of the most concerning things about attacks similar to the Nikkei breach is that the attackers are often able to easily bypass MFA defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An employee’s computer gets hit by malware designed to steal credentials. The malware grabs Slack session tokens and cookies, then sends them to attacker command and control servers,” Avakian said. “With those stolen and likely active tokens, the attacker is able to log into Slack from their own device and access private channels and chat history without even triggering a multi-factor authentication prompt, since they reused an already-authenticated session.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avakian said that the nature of these attacks suggests that enterprise CISOs should consider procedural changes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This kind of attack would give threat actors “broad access to channels and integrations, which made the impact worse. Weaknesses around this incident shine a light on unmanaged or poorly protected devices, long-lived tokens, and not enough logging or alerts for suspicious sessions,” Avakian said. “Organizations can learn from these types of incident, and those using Slack, or any other widely used communications platform similar to Slack, should maintain a policy for revoking active sessions and refreshing tokens for affected users routinely, forcing password resets and rotating API tokens.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyeman/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Man&lt;/a&gt;, a senior information security consultant with Online Business Systems, pointed out, “the larger discussion should be on the failings of the Nikkei IT/IS program to protect against some sort of attack that targeted its employees. Why are employees allowed to use Slack on personal devices?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So this is really an issue of risk management,” Man said. “In the case of Nikkei, it appears the exploitation was elsewhere [on the system]. The initial access allowed the miscreants to use credentials to gain access to Slack. That’s not a compromise of Slack itself, that’s a compromise of employee account authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thecyberdr.com/#about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Boyce&lt;/a&gt;, security consultant and CEO of The Cyber Dr., said the Nikkei incident represents “what happens when someone uses a personal device to get into work systems. Once that device gets hit with malware, it’s game over for the credentials. The part that worries me is this could happen anywhere. People forget how much sensitive stuff ends up in Slack: messages, files, links, sometimes even credentials. Once someone has that, they can poke around pretty freely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, it’s just another reminder that zero trust has to go all the way out to the edge, not just the network. You’ve got to know the device, use MFA tied to managed hardware, and control what data lives in those SaaS tools,” Boyce said. “You may be also asking ‘Well, do we do away with BYOD all together?’ And the short answer is ‘no’ but we do need to look at ways we can secure the workforce beyond company issued assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Operation Chargeback: 4.3 million cardholders affected, EUR 300 million in damages</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/operation-chargeback-43-million-cardholders-affected-eur-300-million-in-damages</link>
      <description>On 4 November 2025, an international coordinated action day targeted three major fraud and money laundering networks as part of Operation “Chargeback.” Led by the Cybercrime Department (Landeszentralstelle Cybercrime) of the General Prosecutor's Office (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) in Koblenz, Germany, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the operation has been investigating these networks since December 2020. More than 60 house searches were conducted and a total of 18 arrest warrants executed. The criminal networks are suspected of misusing credit card data from over 4.3 million cardholders across 193 countries. In total, the estimated damage from the fraud scheme exceeds EUR 300 million, with attempted damages amounting to over EUR 750 million.</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

      <title>Cybercrime-as-a-service takedown: 7 arrested</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>
