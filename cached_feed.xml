      <title>Key questions CISOs must ask before adopting AI-enabled cyber solutions</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094763/key-questions-cisos-must-ask-before-adopting-ai-enabled-cyber-solutions.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adversaries are hijacking AI technology for their own purposes, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3982379/deepfake-attacks-are-inevitable-cisos-cant-prepare-soon-enough.html"&gt;generating deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3850783/11-ways-cybercriminals-are-making-phishing-more-potent-than-ever.html"&gt;creating clever phishing lures&lt;/a&gt;, and launching novel types of advanced attacks. They are also targeting AI systems with prompt injection attacks aimed at tricking models into revealing sensitive data. And users are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3964282/cisos-no-closer-to-containing-shadow-ais-skyrocketing-data-risks.html"&gt;leaking sensitive data&lt;/a&gt; through the unauthorized or careless use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs who don’t respond to these threats with their own AI-powered defenses are putting their organizations at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to IBM’s 2025 &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-07-30-ibm-report-13-of-organizations-reported-breaches-of-ai-models-or-applications,-97-of-which-reported-lacking-proper-ai-access-controls"&gt;Cost of a Data Breach&lt;/a&gt; report, based on a survey by the Ponemon Institute, organizations that extensively deployed AI across their enterprise cybersecurity defenses slashed the amount of time it took to recover from a breach by 80 days, lowering their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567697/what-is-the-cost-of-a-data-breach-3.html"&gt;average breach cost by $1.9 million&lt;/a&gt;. And 20% of organizations surveyed said they suffered a breach due to security incidents involving shadow AI. The additional breach cost associated with high levels of shadow AI was an estimated $670,000, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virtually every established security vendor and scores of startups are touting AI-powered security solutions. Incumbents are embedding AI into their existing toolsets. And &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080699/10-promising-cybersecurity-startups-cisos-should-know-about.html"&gt;startups&lt;/a&gt; are offering autonomous agents that address specific areas such as vulnerability assessments, email security, endpoint security, or cloud data security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IDC analyst Craig Robinson says, “Vendors are rapidly embedding AI and generative AI into their incident response workflows to enhance speed, accuracy, and scalability.” Key applications include threat detection, triage, and anomaly detection; generative AI for automated report generation, timeline reconstruction, and executive summaries; natural language queries for log analysis and threat hunting; and AI agents for malware analysis, code interpretation, and adversary behavior prediction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A survey of CISOs conducted by Splunk reveals that the top use cases for AI and gen AI security are threat detection, triaging alerts, querying security data, automating alert management and response, threat hunting, suggesting investigation steps, threat analysis, and processing phishing emails. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059116/6-novel-ways-to-use-ai-in-cybersecurity.html"&gt;Novel uses of AI&lt;/a&gt; for defense are rapidly evolving, including machine-learning generative adversarial networks. And &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4079887/top-7-agentic-ai-use-cases-for-cybersecurity.html"&gt;agentic AI use cases for cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; are already on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs looking to enhance their security defenses with AI-powered tools, here are some key questions to ask prospective AI security vendors. But before CISOs engage with vendors, it’s important to get your ducks in a row.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-cisos-need-to-think-about-before-talking-to-vendors"&gt;What CISOs need to think about before talking to vendors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the use of AI at my organization expand our attack surface?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to get a clear picture of how current and future AI implementations at your organization create new potential vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Achieving that clarity will require asking a wide range of questions that span the organization and beyond. For example, are we deploying or planning to deploy clusters of GPU-based servers in the data center to run AI workloads? Will my current network detection and response tools be able to handle this surge in additional traffic? Are software developers writing new AI apps? How do I protect that development pipeline? How is AI being embedded in my organization’s supply chain? Are we currently building or planning to build our own LLMs on premises, in the cloud, or will we be using third-party LLMs? Everyday SaaS productivity tools incorporate AI into workflows; how do I protect that back-and-forth traffic, which might contain sensitive information?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the IBM-Ponemon breach report, 13% of surveyed organizations have experienced an attack on their AI models or applications. “That percentage is small, for now. We are likely to see many more in the coming 12 months, unless security leaders and their business counterparts recognize the risk and pivot to focus more intently on AI security,” says the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;my risk tolerance, level of maturity, and regulatory environment? &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no point in buying an agentic tool that the vendor claims to be capable of acting autonomously, if the culture of your shop is that these types of tools won’t be completely trusted or properly deployed. Your security practitioners might not get full value out of them or might not use them at all. If your organization is in a highly regulated industry, will it pass muster with the auditors if your logs and other telemetry data are sent to the cloud for processing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What problem am I trying to solve&lt;/strong&gt;? Before jumping into an AI security solution, CISOs need to clearly identify the highest priority risks. Are you worried about data leakage, ransomware, incident response, data privacy regulations, securing the application development pipeline, securing assets in the cloud? Or all the above? It’s important to align your most critical needs with the strengths of the vendor solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform or point product?&lt;/strong&gt; The perennial point product vs. platform conundrum applies to AI security as well. If my organization has an incumbent security platform vendor and is satisfied with that vendor, does the incumbent offer sufficient AI security capabilities to meet my needs, currently and in the future? Or do I need to seek out point products to address specific gaps?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questions-to-ask-vendors-about-their-ai-security-offerings"&gt;Questions to ask vendors about their AI security offerings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several areas where CISOs will want to focus their attention when considering AI-powered cyber solutions, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow AI: &lt;/strong&gt;Uncovering and addressing shadow AI throughout the organization is a key issue for security leaders today. But so too is ensuring that sanctioned AI-enabled solutions are not misused in similar ways.To protect against this, CISOs should ask: Does the vendor offer discovery capabilities to help identify shadow AI usage? What policies and procedures, education and training, identity management and access control, data leakage protection, does the vendor offer to enable employees to continue to use AI, while layering on security features?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data protection:&lt;/strong&gt; The superpower of AI security tools is their ability to ingest and process vast amounts of data in near real-time. But where does that data reside? On-prem, in the cloud, or both? Who is responsible for protecting LLMs and other data stores both at rest and in motion? If the vendor is using homegrown or third-party AI models, and providing conduits to the customer’s third-party AI models, how does the vendor protect those pipelines? How does the security team detect vulnerabilities or data leakage in a “black box” LLM? Who is responsible for protecting LLMs against prompt injection attacks or other types of model manipulation? Will my data be used to train the vendor’s models and, if so, how can I be sure that data is protected?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics:&lt;/strong&gt; Much of the initial hype surrounding AI has turned to disappointment because organizations are &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3850763/88-of-ai-pilots-fail-to-reach-production-but-thats-not-all-on-it.html"&gt;struggling to identify benefits from AI pilot projects&lt;/a&gt;. CISOs need to be able to provide measurable results for any AI security tool. That can include improved mean-time-to-discovery (MMTD) and mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) in the event of a breach, a quantifiable reduction in the rate of false positives, improved productivity among SOC staffers, increased accuracy of anomaly detection and threat hunting activities. CISOs should ask vendors and advisors, What metrics will best reflect the value these AI capabilities will have, and can those be captured to help assess the efficacy of the AI capabilities and our use of them?  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workforce:&lt;/strong&gt; What kind of training does the vendor provide for the most efficient use of AI, generative AI, and most importantly, agentic AI. Will the AI tool be able to automate low-level tasks so that my SOC analysts can focus on higher-level activities? How does the vendor offering help me to address the skills gap? Are there models and best practices for reorganizing my workforce for the era of AI. Will the use of AI security tools help address overwork and burnout among my staff? Are there specific guidelines or best practices for how my security team should interact with the AI in a human-in-the-loop, copilot-style scenario?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration: &lt;/strong&gt;How will the AI security tool integrate with my current security stack and my security processes and procedures? Most CISOs already have an overload of tools — EDR, XDR, SIEM, SOAR, CSPM, etc. What APIs and pre-built connections are provided to seamlessly integrate with my existing infrastructure? What types of agreements and alliances do you have with other vendors? How can I maintain a single dashboard? If a platform vendor has recently acquired an AI security tool, how well is that new capability integrated within the platform? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation: &lt;/strong&gt;How will your tool conform to the specific regulatory requirements in my industry with regard to data storage and data privacy. Do you keep up with changes to regulations?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust:&lt;/strong&gt; How can I make sure that my security team trusts the decisions and recommendations that the AI systems make? In what ways can security practitioners go back and retrace how a model reached a conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s to be expected that data stores will increase in volume. And an enterprise might pilot the tool at one location, with plans to roll it out globally. How can I be sure the cloud-based AI tools can scale to meet my needs? Can the system handle large traffic volumes without performance delays. Does the solution encompass endpoints, networks, cloud, SaaS?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roadmap:&lt;/strong&gt; What is your roadmap for updating the tool, delivering timely patches and providing new capabilities on a regular basis?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model integrity:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you address concerns about bias in your models. How do you ensure data accuracy and integrity? How do you assure that the models are constantly updated to reflect changing real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendor credibility&lt;/strong&gt;: How long has this vendor been around? Do they have leaders with an industry pedigree? Do they have references that you can check? What is the financial viability of the company? For a startup, how much money have they raised? Are they generating revenue?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the licensing terms? What types of SLAs or other performance metrics are included with a subscription?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Der &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4092016/energiesektor-im-visier-von-hackern.html" target="_blank"&gt;Energiesektor &lt;/a&gt;gerät zunehmend in den Fokus von Cyberkriminellen. Aus Sicht von Experten und des Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) muss der Schutz in diesem Bereich massiv erhöht werden. Wie beurteilen Sie die aktuelle Lage in Deutschland?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; Die geopolitischen Spannungen, die wir aktuell sehen, führen zu einer erhöhten Bedrohungslage. Das betrifft natürlich auch die Heizungsbranche, in der Vaillant tätig ist und die das Grundbedürfnis aller Menschen nach Wärme und Warmwasser zu Hause erfüllt. Solche Bereiche müssen auf jeden Fall verstärkt geschützt werden. Das Problem ist, dass die Angriffe immer gezielter und komplexer werden. Heutzutage haben wir es nicht mehr mit den weniger erfahrenen Script Kiddies aus dem heimischen Keller, sondern mittlerweile mit gut organisierten und professionellen Cyberkriminellen zu tun. Ziel ist es, dem Unternehmen beziehungsweise der Wirtschaft des jeweiligen Landes zu schaden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hinzu kommt, dass die Eintrittsschwelle für Angriffe auf Unternehmen und die Lieferkette durch die Nutzung von künstlicher Intelligenz im Unternehmen viel geringer als je zuvor ist. Dadurch wird es beispielsweise einfacher, gezielte Phishing-E-Mails zu verfassen oder &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491897/was-ist-malware.html" target="_blank"&gt;Malware&lt;/a&gt; zu entwickeln, was zuvor mit deutlich höherem Aufwand verbunden war.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wie reagieren Sie auf die veränderte Situation? Wie schützen Sie Ihr Unternehmen aktuell vor Cyberattacken?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß: &lt;/strong&gt;Wir verfolgen einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz in der Informationssicherheit. Das bedeutet, wir schauen uns wirklich alle Themen von oben bis unten an und setzen auf ein mehrschichtiges Sicherheitskonzept. Dabei werden sowohl präventive als auch reaktive Sicherheitsmaßnahmen einbezogen, um im Ernstfall schnell und effektiv reagieren zu können. Dabei ist uns bewusst: Kein Unternehmen kann absolute Sicherheit garantieren. Deshalb sollte jeder mit der Annahme planen, dass ein erfolgreicher Angriff jederzeit möglich ist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wir legen nicht nur Wert auf die Absicherung unserer internen IT-Landschaft, sondern auf unsere weltweite Produktion und Produkte für unsere Kunden. Dabei stehen der Schutz unserer Endkunden und die Einhaltung hoher Sicherheitsstandards für uns im Mittelpunkt – insbesondere angesichts der wachsenden Bedrohung durch Ransomware-Angriffe. Unser Fokus liegt darauf, proaktiv Risiken zu minimieren und das Vertrauen in unsere Lösungen langfristig zu sichern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Und die Mitarbeiter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersicherheit beginnt beim Menschen. Durch die globale Vernetzung bei Vaillant legen wir in Sachen Security ganz klar den Fokus darauf. Durch unseren holistischen 4-Säulen-Ansatz setzen wir auf eine umfassende Sensibilisierung unserer gesamten Belegschaft, von Gamification-Ansätzen bis hin zu praxisnahen Compliance-Schulungen. Dabei greifen wir auch Themen aus dem privaten Umfeld auf, wie etwa Phishing-Beispiele einiger Telekommunikationsunternehmen oder Paketzustelldienste, um die Relevanz zu erhöhen und nachhaltige Lernprozesse zu fördern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welche Herausforderungen machen CISOs aktuell am meisten zu schaffen?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß: &lt;/strong&gt;Zunächst einmal: Die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072083/vom-ciso-zum-chief-risk-architect.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rolle des CISO&lt;/a&gt; hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren grundlegend gewandelt. Früher lag der Fokus primär auf technischen Aspekten und operativer Sicherheit. Heute sind strategische Ausrichtung und Leadership-Kompetenzen zentrale Schlüsselqualifikationen. Ein moderner &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495028/chief-information-security-officer-ein-neues-berufsbild-fur-cisos.html" target="_blank"&gt;CISO&lt;/a&gt; muss nicht nur technologische Risiken managen, sondern auch als Sparringspartner des Managements agieren, Business-Risiken bewerten und die Informationssicherheit als integralen Bestandteil der Unternehmensstrategie verankern..&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aus meiner Sicht liegen aktuell die größten Herausforderungen darin, die neuen gesetzlichen Vorgaben wie NIS2, DORA und Cyber Resilience Act umzusetzen. Ich bezeichne das Ganze als Regulatorik-Dschungel, der erst einmal verstanden werden muss. Wir bewegen uns in einem komplexen Regulierungsumfeld, das pragmatisch interpretiert und mit den richtigen Ressourcen umgesetzt werden muss.  Am Ende geht es nicht nur darum, die Compliance zu gewährleisten, sondern das Sicherheitslevel im gesamten Unternehmen zu erhöhen, um eine erhöhte Resilienz zu schaffen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haben wir zu viele Sicherheitsregeln?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß: &lt;/strong&gt;In der Heizungsbranche sind die regulatorischen Anforderungen überschaubar, auch wenn &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4022498/nis2-umsetzungsgesetz-geschaftsleitung-haftet-mit-privatvermogen.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS2&lt;/a&gt; und weitere relevant sind. Grundsätzlich begrüße ich einheitliche Standards, da sie die Sicherheit in Deutschland und Europa erhöhen. Die Herausforderung liegt in der nationalen Umsetzung: Jedes Land interpretiert die Vorgaben unterschiedlich, was für international tätige Unternehmen eine erhebliche Komplexität bedeutet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einheitliche und pragmatische Sicherheitsregeln für Europa zur Umsetzung zu entwicklen ist dem Gesetzgeber von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090107/bundestag-beschliest-nis2-umsetzung.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS2 &lt;/a&gt;nicht gelungen. NIS2 wurde zwar auf EU-Ebene verabschiedet, muss aber in die lokale Gesetzgebung der jeweiligen Länder überführt werden. Das bedeutet, dass jedes Land seine eigene Interpretation mit einbringt. Organisationen, die europaweit tätig sind, müssen dabei jegliche Gesetzgebung auch in der jeweiligen Region berücksichtigen. An dieser Stelle ein standardisiertes Verfahren zu gewährleisten bedeutet zusätzliche Komplexität und hohen Abstimmungsaufwand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warum kämpfen so viele Unternehmen aktuell noch bei der Umsetzung?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; Oft fehlt die Klarheit bei der Auslegung der Vorgaben. Viele Unternehmen – insbesondere KMU – wissen nicht, ob sie überhaupt in den Geltungsbereich fallen. Hinzu kommen Fragen zur Ressourcenzuteilung: Soll die Umsetzung intern erfolgen oder mit externen Partnern? Wer übernimmt die Verantwortung – die IT, die Compliance-Abteilung oder ein dediziertes Security-Team? Zusätzlich mangelt es häufig an Reifegrad und Bewusstsein, wo und wie Cybersicherheit strategisch verankert werden muss, damit derartige Themen angemessen umgesetzt werden können. Diese Faktoren lähmen den Fortschritt und kosten Unternehmen entscheidende Zeit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein „Kochrezept“ für Regularien gibt es nicht. Ich empfehle Unternehmen Ihre Ausgangslage zu analysieren, erste Schritte zu definieren und loszulegen. Mein Motto lautet: Starten statt Warten!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;

      <title>AI Adoption Surges While Governance Lags — Report Warns of Growing Shadow Identity Risk</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099211/ai-adoption-surges-while-governance-lags-report-warns-of-growing-shadow-identity-risk.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2025-state-of-ai-data-security-report-cyera/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2025 State of AI Data Security Report&lt;/a&gt; reveals a widening contradiction in enterprise security: AI adoption is nearly universal, yet oversight remains limited. Eighty-three percent of organizations already use AI in daily operations, but only 13 percent say they have strong visibility into how these systems handle sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Produced by &lt;a href="https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cybersecurity Insiders&lt;/a&gt; with research support from &lt;a href="https://www.cyera.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyera Research Labs&lt;/a&gt;, the study reflects responses from 921 cybersecurity and IT professionals across industries and organization sizes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data shows AI increasingly behaving as an ungoverned identity — a non-human user that reads faster, accesses more, and operates continuously. Yet most organizations still use human-centric identity models that break down at machine speed. As a result, two-thirds have caught AI tools over-accessing sensitive information, and 23 percent admit they have no controls for prompts or outputs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Autonomous AI agents stand out as the most exposed frontier. Seventy-six percent of respondents say these agents are the hardest systems to secure, while 57 percent lack the ability to block risky AI actions in real time. Visibility remains thin: nearly half report no visibility into AI usage and another third say they have only minimal insight — leaving most enterprises unsure where AI is operating or what data it touches. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Governance structures lag behind adoption as well. Only 7 percent of organizations have a dedicated AI governance team, and just 11 percent feel prepared to meet emerging regulatory requirements, underscoring how quickly readiness gaps are widening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report calls for a shift toward data-centric AI oversight with continuous discovery of AI use, real-time monitoring of prompts and outputs, and identity policies that treat AI as a distinct actor with narrowly scoped access driven by data sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI is no longer just another tool — it’s acting as a new identity inside the enterprise, one that never sleeps and often ignores boundaries,” said Holger Schulze with Cybersecurity Insiders. “Without visibility and robust governance, enterprises will keep finding their data in places it was never meant to be.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the report cautions: “You cannot secure an AI agent you do not identify, and you cannot govern what you cannot see.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251209/uk-cso-30-awards.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With submissions showcasing advances in automation, inclusion, workforce development, and real-world resilience, this year’s programme highlights the multifaceted role of today’s CSO. As threats evolve and organizational complexity grows, the CSO is now a strategist, communicator, technologist, and cultural leader. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A panel of expert judges reviewed an exceptional set of candidates, ultimately selecting winners whose work demonstrates measurable impact, strategic clarity, and a commitment to elevating the cybersecurity profession. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below are the 2025 CSO 30 Award Innovation Award winners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI and Digital Excellence in Cybersecurity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Greg Emmerson, Applegreen&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This category celebrates outstanding leadership in AI, automation, and digital innovation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="UK CSO 30 2025 winner Greg Emmerson (right) with judge Andrew Barber (left)" class="wp-image-4098823" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_142.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CSO 30 2025 winner Greg Emmerson (right) with judge Andrew Barber (left)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Emmerson stood out for transforming both the culture and capability of Applegreen’s security organization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emmerson established regional Centres of Excellence to strengthen collaboration and skill development across global teams, modernizing operations through Continuous Threat Exposure Management and enterprise-wide canary tooling. By unifying identities and embedding advanced backup and recovery practices, he has positioned security as a true business enabler. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His approach balances innovation with wellbeing, promoting focused priorities, adaptive working, and micro-learning initiatives that have elevated awareness and resilience across the enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising Star in Cybersecurity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Chris Bardell, Royal Papworth Hospital&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The Rising Star Award recognizes early-career professionals whose dedication and innovation are already reshaping security within their organizations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While completing a demanding Level 4 Cyber Security Apprenticeship, Bardell led major improvements across incident response, automation, AI governance, and endpoint resilience. His work on ransomware preparedness, simulations, phishing exercises, and awareness campaigns has significantly strengthened operational readiness at Royal Papworth Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combining technical capability with empathy and collaboration, Bardell exemplifies the next generation of cyber leadership. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity, Inclusion and Social Impact in Security&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Amy Lemberger&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This award honours leaders who advance equity, inclusion, and societal benefit through their security programs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="UK CSO 30 2025 winner Amy Lemberger (right) and judge Theo Botha (left)" class="wp-image-4098824" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_147.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CSO 30 2025 winner Amy Lemberger (right) and judge Theo Botha (left)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amy Lemberger built an entire cybersecurity function from the ground up, prioritizing inclusive hiring, removing unnecessary qualification barriers, and personally reaching out to underrepresented talent. The resulting team is high-performing, diverse, and characterized by exceptional retention and trust. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lemberger has driven innovation through automation and AI partnerships while championing mental health, meaningful leadership, and authentic inclusion across the cyber community. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People, Culture and Security Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Simon Chan, Berenberg&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This category recognizes leaders who enable security-aware cultures through engagement, creativity, and cross-functional collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="UK CSO 30 2025 judge Holly Foxcroft (far right) with representatives from Berenberg representatives (left) " class="wp-image-4098829" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_150.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CSO 30 2025 judge Holly Foxcroft (far right) with representatives from Berenberg (left)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK/Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simon Chan transformed security engagement at Berenberg through storytelling and inclusive communication. His team’s innovative internal podcast series opened conversations across the business, showcasing varied perspectives and building a shared sense of responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By blending technical insight with human connection, Chan positioned cybersecurity not as a back-office function but as a collaborative driver of enterprise success. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Talent and Workforce Development in Security&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Adrian Hope, University of Warwick&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Adrian Hope reshaped cybersecurity culture within higher education by uniting academic and operational communities. His work brings together students, scholars, and professionals to enhance defences and embed security across the university. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="UK CSO 30 2025 winner Adrian Hope (left) and CSO 30 Chair Romy Tuin (right)" class="wp-image-4098826" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_152.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CSO 30 2025 winner Adrian Hope (left) and CSO 30 Chair Romy Tuin (right)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hope has fostered a diverse and empowered team, championed responsible AI adoption, and delivered creative awareness initiatives including a Cyber Security Escape Room to engage staff and students alike. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His efforts demonstrate what is possible when security leadership embraces education, collaboration, and long-term talent development. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSO of the Year&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner: Craig Hickmott, British Heart Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The highest honour of the evening, the CSO of the Year Award, recognizes visionary leadership with enterprise-wide impact. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="UK CSO of the Year winner Craig Hickmott (right) with judge Manoj Bhatt (left)" class="wp-image-4098822" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_154.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK CSO of the Year winner Craig Hickmott (right) with judge Manoj Bhatt (left)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Craig Hickmott inherited a fragmented and under-resourced security function. Through strategic clarity, persistence, and a human-first philosophy, he secured long-term investment, rebuilt the team, and embedded security across the organization as a true partner and enabler. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hickmott has created one of the sector’s most diverse security teams, launched the organization’s first cybersecurity apprenticeship, and introduced groundbreaking practices including AI “team members,” data-driven operations, and transformative ransomware simulations for executives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has championed wellbeing, mental health, and psychological safety through initiatives such as “Manual of Me,” fostering a culture where security and humanity reinforce one another. His holistic approach has strengthened resilience across an organization whose mission impacts millions of lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSO 30 Hall of Fame 2025&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evening concluded with the induction of three exceptional leaders into the prestigious CSO 30 Hall of Fame, individuals whose long-term contributions have shaped the cybersecurity landscape. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Botha, Chief Information Security Officer, Dr. Martens&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With over twenty years in technology and cybersecurity, Botha has built and delivered security strategies across multiple industries. At Dr. Martens, he leads the security and governance approach enabling responsible AI adoption while preserving brand heritage and driving transformation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Theo Botha, Chief Information Security Officer, Dr. Martens" class="wp-image-4098825" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_155.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine Eskenzi, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO, The Zensory&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Eskenzi has redefined how organizations approach wellbeing, focus, and digital resilience. Through The Zensory, she has helped more than 150,000 people reduce burnout and build healthier workplace cultures, integrating neuroscience, wellbeing, and cybersecurity for global brands including Google, Vodafone and the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jasmine Eskenzi, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO, The Zensory" class="wp-image-4098828" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_156.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Barber, Head of Apps and Devices, Surrey and Sussex Police&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Barber oversees a team developing innovative, user-centred solutions that enhance public safety. Across a career in financial services and technology leadership, he has delivered large-scale transformation while championing mental health, diversity and inclusion, demonstrating that leadership must balance technical excellence with empathy. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Andrew Barber, Head of Apps and Devices, Surrey and Sussex Police receives UK CSO Hall of Fame award" class="wp-image-4098827" height="683" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CSO30-Awards-UK-2025_158.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO UK / Foundry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrating a New Era of Cybersecurity Leadership&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year’s CSO 30 Awards highlight a profound shift in the industry. Today’s cybersecurity leaders are not only technologists, they are culture builders, educators, innovators, and advocates for people. Their work ensures not just safer systems, but stronger, more resilient organizations. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>16.6 million packages of fake and harmful toys taken off EU markets</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/166-million-packages-of-fake-and-harmful-toys-taken-eu-markets</link>
      <description>Fake toys are poisoning, deafening and injuring children across Europe, while causing major losses to the EU economy. 26 countries, coordinated by Europol, co-led by France, Spain and Romania, and supported by the EUIPO and OLAF, have once again led initiatives to take down the producers and importers of counterfeit toys. With the global toy market valued at up to EUR 300 billion annually, it also remains the second-most counterfeited industry globally.</description>

      <title>Coordinated strike hits violent criminal network behind large-scale illegal gambling and money laundering in Sweden</title>

      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <title>Security-Tools für KI-Infrastrukturen – ein Kaufratgeber</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/3560109/security-tools-fur-ki-infrastrukturen-ein-kaufratgeber.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="KI-Infrastrukturen" class="wp-image-3560127" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1200x_6b59cb.png?w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Tools, die die KI-Infrastruktur unter die Lupe nehmen, optimieren und absichern, liegen im Trend. Unser Ratgeber führt Sie zur richtigen AI-Security-Posture-Management-Lösung.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Julien Tromeur | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weil sich &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494359/der-grose-ki-risiko-guide.html" target="_blank"&gt;Generative-AI-Lösungen&lt;/a&gt; branchenübergreifend verbreiten, wächst das Sicherheitsbedürfnis der Anwender. Diesem gerecht zu werden, ist vor allem deshalb eine Challenge, weil die Technologie enormen Einfluss auf die IT-Infrastruktur und die Unternehmensdaten nimmt. Und weil kriminelle Cyberakteure längst erkannt haben, welches &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494507/large-language-models-absichern-die-10-haufigsten-llm-schwachstellen.html" target="_blank"&gt;Potenzial&lt;/a&gt; für sie in diesem Umstand schlummert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gefragt sind deshalb neue, breit gefächerte Schutz- und Notfallmaßnahmen und Sicherheitssoftware, die spezifisch darauf ausgelegt ist, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3557710/5-tipps-fur-mehr-sicherheit-im-ki-zeitalter.html" target="_blank"&gt;KI-Infrastrukturen abzusichern&lt;/a&gt;. Das hat längst diverse Cybersecurity-Anbieter dazu bewogen, entsprechende Lösungen zu entwickeln. Oder bestehende Produkte mit entsprechenden Features anzureichern. Dieses Wachstumssegment des Security-Markts läuft auch unter der Bezeichnung “AI Security Posture Management” – kurz AI-SPM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesem Artikel erfahren Sie:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;was Security-Lösungen ausmacht, die KI-Infrastrukturen absichern.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;was AI-SPM-Tools leisten sollten und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;welche Anbieter und Produkte in diesem Bereich wichtig sind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="cspm-dspm-und-ai-spm"&gt;CSPM, DSPM und AI-SPM&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI Security Posture Management fokussiert darauf, die Integrität und Sicherheit von KI- und ML-Systemen zu gewährleisten. Dabei umfasst AI-SPM Strategien, Tools und Techniken, um Daten, Pipelines, Applikationen und Services mit Blick auf ihre Sicherheitslage:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zu überwachen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;zu bewerten und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;zu optimieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bisher wurden Security Posture Management Tools für zwei separate Bereiche entwickelt:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495818/cloud-risiken-verwalten-so-wahlen-sie-das-passende-cspm-tool-aus.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud Security Posture Management&lt;/a&gt; (CSPM-) Tools sollen den Cloud-Betrieb allgemein absichern, in erster Linie gegen Fehlkonfigurationen und Missbrauch.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493645/data-security-posture-management-die-besten-dspm-tools.html" target="_blank"&gt;Data Security Posture Management&lt;/a&gt; (DSPM-) Tools sollen vor Datenlecks und Malware-Infektionen schützen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Aufkommen von künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) und Large Language Models (LLMs) hat Bedarf für eine dritte Produktkategorie geschaffen, die gemanagte KI-Cloud-Services und ihre SDKs (beispielsweise Hugging Face Transformer oder Azure Open AI) überwacht und KI-Modellmissbrauch verhindert – AI-SPM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dass das nötig war, unterstreichen diverse Research-Erkenntnisse, -Beiträge und weitere Ressourcen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eine &lt;a href="https://konghq.com/resources/reports/ai-and-api-adoption-challenges" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Studie des API-Spezialisten Kong&lt;/a&gt; (Download gegen Daten) kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass eine Mehrheit der Befragten Wege gefunden hat, Beschränkungen mit Blick auf die KI-Nutzung zu umgehen. Ein Viertel muss sich erst gar nicht mit so etwas wie Guidelines herumschlagen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Die Non-Profit-Organisation MITRE stellt mit seiner &lt;a href="https://atlas.mitre.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial Intelligence Systems&lt;/a&gt; (ATLAS) eine umfassende Datenbank mit Angriffstaktiken zur Verfügung, die auf “in the wild”-Beobachtungen beruht.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Auch das MIT betreibt &lt;a href="https://airisk.mit.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eine aktive Datenbank&lt;/a&gt;, die mehr als 1.600 Risiken in Zusammenhang mit KI-Systemen bereithält.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eine weitere Quelle, um sich mit KI-bezogenen Angriffsmethoden auseinanderzusetzen, bietet das 2023 von OWASP veröffentlichte &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/assets/PDF/OWASP-Top-10-for-LLMs-2023-v1_1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LLM-Exploit-Ranking&lt;/a&gt; (PDF). Die Non-Profit-Organisation hat zudem &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493126/genai-security-als-checkliste.html" target="_blank"&gt;eine Checkliste für GenAI-Sicherheit&lt;/a&gt; veröffentlicht.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sich mit diesen Quellen auseinanderzusetzen, empfiehlt sich, bevor Sie sich für ein Sicherheits-Tool oder -Feature aus dem Bereich AI-SPM entscheiden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-security-posture-management-fur-ki-leisten-sollte"&gt;Was Security Posture Management für KI leisten sollte&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools im Bereich AI Security Posture Management:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bieten im Regelfall agentenlose Konfigurationen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;greifen auf Cloud-basierte Modelle zu und&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;belassen Daten auf den vorhandenen Plattformen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letzteres dient sowohl der Sicherheit als auch dazu, die Verlagerung der damit verbundenen, massiven Datenbestände zu vermeiden. Darüber hinaus spielen bei Security-Tools für KI-Infrastrukturen natürlich auch &lt;strong&gt;KI-bezogene Funktionen&lt;/strong&gt; eine Rolle. Zum Beispiel um große Datenmengen zu klassifizieren, zu tracken und gegen mögliche Missbrauchs- und Angriffsversuche &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493625/studie-it-security-trends-2024mehr-schutz-gegen-und-fur-ki.html" target="_blank"&gt;abzusichern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einige Anbieter haben ihre bestehenden CSPM- oder DSPM-Lösungen um AI-SPM-Features erweitert – inklusive &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495375/third-party-risk-management-so-vermeiden-sie-compliance-unheil.html" target="_blank"&gt;Compliance-Prüfverfahren&lt;/a&gt;, Best Practices und Richtlinien, die alle drei Security-Posture-Management-Arten abdecken. Andere offerieren umfassendere Lösungen, die eine Vielzahl KI-bezogener Sicherheitsmaßnahmen beinhalten. Zum Beispiel, um:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KI-Pipelines und Workloads schützen,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;zu erkennen, wenn KI-Modelle sensible Daten referenzieren,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Trainingsdaten auf Manipulationen durch Dritte oder externe Applikationen zu überprüfen oder&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;KI-Services und -Plattformen abzusichern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="wichtige-ai-spm-anbieter"&gt;Wichtige AI-SPM-Anbieter&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden haben wir die AI-SPM-Produkte und -Features neun verschiedener Anbieter für Sie zusammengefasst. Sämtliche Lösungen versprechen, Ihre KI-Infrastruktur abzusichern, verlassen sich dazu jedoch auf unterschiedliche Ansätze. Dabei ist zu beachten, dass es sich um einen Markt handelt, der im Wachstum begriffen ist. Die Produkte sind also noch nicht so umfassend ausgestaltet und integriert, wie sie sein könnten. Zudem arbeiten diverse weitere Sicherheitsanbieter aktiv an ähnlichen Offerings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cyera.io/platform/dspm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyera.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ist auf Datenklassifizierung spezialisiert und hat eine DSPM-Plattform im Angebot, die um AI-SPM-Features erweitert wird. Die Lösung verspricht beispielsweise Einblicke, auf welche Datenklassen und Data Stores Microsoft-Copilot-Nutzer zugreifen können.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.legitsecurity.com/ai-discovery" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LegitSecurity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hat sich auf die Fahnen geschrieben, das “AI Visibility Gap” schließen zu wollen. Dazu untersucht die AI-SPM-Plattform KI-Modelle, Code Repositories, kryptografische Secrets und andere KI-bezogene Instanzen. Auf dieser Grundlage entstehen schließlich Risk Scores, um entsprechend priorisieren zu können. Mit dieser Lösung können Sie beispielsweise nachvollziehen, welche User Github Copilot auf der Basis von unsicheren KI-Modellen verwenden.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/ai-security-posture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; stellt AI-Security-Posture-Management-Funktionen im Rahmen einer Preview für sein CSPM-Angebot zur Verfügung. Das fertige Produkt soll Ende 2024 zur Verfügung stehen und zum Einsatz kommen, um GenAI-Applikationen in Multi- oder Hybrid-Cloud-Szenarien abzusichern. Dazu wird zum Beispiel eine GenAI-Softwarestückliste (AI BOM) erfasst.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://orca.security/platform/ai-security-posture-management/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Orca Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; verspricht mit seiner Mehrzweck-Sicherheitsplattform unter anderem eine “Ende-zu-Ende”-AI-SPM-Lösung. Diese scannt unter anderem mehr als 50 verschiedene KI-Modellquellen und schlägt Alarm, wenn sie dort – oder in Trainingsdaten-Repositories – sensible Informationen oder Geheimnisse entdeckt.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud/ai-spm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Palo Alto Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hat Ende 2023 die Übernahme des DSPM-Spezialisten Dig Security abgeschlossen und diesen inzwischen vollständig integriert. Das Ergebnis heißt Prisma Cloud AI-SPM und ermöglicht zum Beispiel Top-Level-Scans der KI-Services von AWS, Google Cloud und Azure. Zudem hat der Sicherheitsanbieter MItte 2025 auch den KI-Sicherheitsanbieter Protect AI &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2025/palo-alto-networks-completes-acquisition-of-protect-ai" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;übernommen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://securiti.ai/products/ai-security-governance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Securiti.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; verspricht mit seinem Produkt “AI Security &amp;amp; Governance” Schutz für KI-Instanzen. Dieses ermöglicht zum Beispiel KI-Modellrisiken zu bewerten und zu klassifizieren, Compliance-Prüfungen vorzunehmen oder Kontrollmaßnahmen für Daten und KI-Systeme zu etablieren.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.varonis.com/products/ai-security" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Varonis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; hat seine Sicherheitsplattform ebenfalls um “AI Security” erweitert. Das ermöglicht unter anderem, risikobehaftete KI-Fehlkonfigurationen zu erkennen und zu beheben, KI-generierte Inhalte mit Sensibilitäts-Labels zu versehen sowie KI-Workloads oder Datenflüsse zu erkennen, die sensible Informationen beinhalten. Für Microsoft Copilot steht ein eigenes (aufpreispflichtiges) Modul &lt;a href="https://www.varonis.com/de/coverage/microsoft-365-copilot" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;zur Verfügung&lt;/a&gt; – demnächst sollen weitere für Salesforce Einstein und Google Gemini folgen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/de-de/solutions/ai-spm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wiz Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; verfügt über einschlägige DSPM- und CSPM-Erfahrungswerte und hat auch eine dedizierte KI-SPM-Lösung im Angebot. Diese verspricht zum Beispiel umfassende Einblicke in KI-Pipelines sowie Detektions-Möglichkeiten für Angriffspfade oder Fehlkonfigurationen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>What are zero-day attacks and why do they work?</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094706/what-are-zero-day-attacks-and-why-do-they-work.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero-day attacks have become a significant concern in the realm of cybersecurity, posing a formidable challenge to individuals and organizations alike. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software vendor, leaving systems exposed to potential breaches. As cyberthreats evolve, understanding &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/zero-day-attack?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;zero-day attacks&lt;/a&gt; and implementing effective protection strategies is crucial for maintaining security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-zero-day-attacks"&gt;Understanding zero-day attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a zero-day vulnerability, exploit, and attack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A zero-day vulnerability refers to a software security flaw that is unknown to the vendor. When attackers exploit this vulnerability, it becomes a zero-day exploit. A zero-day attack occurs when malicious actors use this exploit to compromise a system before a patch is available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why “zero-day”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The term “zero-day” signifies that the vendor has zero days to address the vulnerability before it is exploited. This urgency highlights the critical nature of these threats because they can be leveraged by attackers immediately upon discovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common targets of zero-day attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero-day attacks often target operating systems, web browsers, enterprise software, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. These platforms are integral to daily operations, making them attractive targets for attackers seeking to maximize impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why zero-day attacks are so effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero-day attacks have several advantages in the cybersecurity landscape. Due to their novel nature, they can be challenging to detect and understand. Here are some common reasons they work when deployed against unsuspecting targets:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No available patch:&lt;/strong&gt; These exploits are unknown to both vendors and defenders, meaning they have not been identified and patched yet, leaving the door open for attackers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-value targets:&lt;/strong&gt; These attacks are often used in cyber espionage, &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/ransomware?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ransomware&lt;/a&gt; campaigns, and &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/apt?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advanced persistent threats (APTs)&lt;/a&gt; to target high-value assets with sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult to detect:&lt;/strong&gt; These exploits often are missed by traditional detection tools, especially those relying on signature-based detection, allowing adversaries to operate undetected.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed and stealth:&lt;/strong&gt; Successful breaches are more likely with zero-day attacks because attackers act quickly and quietly, allowing them to exploit vulnerabilities before they are identified and patched.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision targeting:&lt;/strong&gt; The target of these exploits is often a specific individual or organization. Spear-phishing and zero-click attacks are common tactics used to initiate the breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="real-world-zero-day-attack-examples"&gt;Real-world zero-day attack examples&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No organization is immune to being targeted by a zero-day attack. In the real world, many key services, organizations, and platforms can be targeted by zero-day exploits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nation-state sabotage:&lt;/strong&gt; State-sponsored attackers can target critical infrastructure and utilities with zero-day exploits, rendering key services and life-saving utilities unavailable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile surveillance:&lt;/strong&gt; In telecommunications, carriers have witnessed zero-click exploits being used in mobile surveillance. This leads to compromised devices without any user interaction.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain attacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Global supply chains are appealing targets because they have a wide impact. In exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, attackers can impact several groups in one attack, such as consumers, manufacturers, employees, and more.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequently targeted platforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Web browsers and email servers are common targets of zero-day attacks. These are widely used, increasing the potential for significant disruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-zero-day-vulnerabilities-are-discovered-and-used"&gt;How zero-day vulnerabilities are discovered and used&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are multiple groups and methodologies that work to discover, use, and inform organizations of zero-day vulnerabilities. These include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White-hat researchers:&lt;/strong&gt; Often ethical hackers, also known as white-hat researchers, discover zero-day vulnerabilities via bug bounty programs and responsible disclosure. This helps vendors identify and address these issues.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black-hat hackers:&lt;/strong&gt; On the flip side, if a black-hat hacker identifies a vulnerability before it is patched, the hacker can leverage it for gain, often selling exploits on the dark web.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government agencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Some government agencies engage in offensive cyber operations, stockpiling exploits for strategic purposes. They also can inform organizations and vendors of these exploits, much like white-hat researchers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thorough investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal security teams can leverage investigation capabilities, such as packet-level insights, to discover and understand zero-day threats, preventing future occurrences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-defend-against-zero-day-attacks"&gt;How to defend against zero-day attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are several measures security and network teams can take to more effectively avoid zero-day attacks. Some examples include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage threat investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Detection alone often misses the unknown. Thorough investigation, leveraging &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/deep-packet-inspection?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deep packet inspection (DPI)&lt;/a&gt; at scale and forensic analysis, is key to identifying and preventing zero-day attacks from being successful now and in the future.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch quickly:&lt;/strong&gt; Prioritizing updates and effective vulnerability management is essential to mitigating the risk of zero-day attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use behavior-based detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Employing solutions such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/ndr?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;network detection and response (NDR)&lt;/a&gt;, and extended detection and response (XDR) in combination with a strong investigation focus can help identify anomalous behavior that can signify zero-day exploits are being leveraged.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt zero-trust principles:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing a &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/zero-trust-security-architecture?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;zero-trust security architecture&lt;/a&gt;, limiting user access, and continuously verifying identities can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segment the network:&lt;/strong&gt; Strategic network segmentation helps contain breaches and minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is-mitre-attack/lateral-movement?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lateral movement&lt;/a&gt; within a compromised system.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay informed: &lt;/strong&gt;Subscribing to security advisories and threat intelligence feeds helps keep organizations informed on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="faqs-about-zero-day-attacks"&gt;FAQs about zero-day attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes zero-day attacks different from other cyberthreats?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities, making them particularly challenging to defend against compared with threats targeting known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can antivirus software detect zero-day exploits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional antivirus software may struggle to detect zero-day exploits due to its reliance on signature-based detection methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are zero-day vulnerabilities illegal to sell or use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although selling or using zero-day vulnerabilities for malicious purposes is illegal, ethical disclosure through bug bounty programs is encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long do zero-day exploits typically remain undetected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The duration for which a zero-day exploit remains undetected varies, but it can range from days to months, depending on the complexity of the exploit and the vigilance of security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="staying-ahead-of-emerging-threats-with-investigation"&gt;Staying ahead of emerging threats with investigation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero-day attacks represent a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape, exploiting unknown vulnerabilities to devastating effect. Understanding these attacks and implementing proactive defensive strategies is essential for staying ahead of emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detection alone is not enough. Detection-focused tools such as EDR, NDR, and XDR on their own miss the unknown, allowing zero-day attacks to have a better chance of success. Leveraging investigation, powered by &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/what-is/packet?utm_source=idg&amp;amp;utm_medium=display&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand-campaign-cybersecurity&amp;amp;utm_keyword=brandpost&amp;amp;utm_content=article_coverage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;packet&lt;/a&gt; data, empowers teams with the actionable data to detect, understand, and prevent future attacks. Packets do not lie, and the network is the only place adversaries cannot hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How CISOs can prepare for the new era of short-lived TLS certificates</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4097721/how-cisos-can-prepare-for-the-new-era-of-short-lived-tls-certificates.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, organizations used &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/564131/what-is-ssl-how-ssl-certificates-enable-encrypted-communication.html"&gt;SSL/TLS certificates&lt;/a&gt; with long lifespans, reviewing and renewing them only occasionally. That is about to change. On 15 March 2026, the maximum lifespan of a TLS certificate will be cut from 398 days to 200 days. Then, a year later, the limit will drop again to 100 days, and by 2029 it’ll fall to just 47 days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift, meant to increase security, began with a proposal from Apple, which was approved in April 2025 by the CA/Browser Forum, a consortium of certificate authorities. The idea received backing from the other three major browser makers: Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Shorter certificate lifespans are a gift,” says Justin Shattuck, CSO at Resilience. “They push people toward better automation and certificate management practices, which will later be vital to post-quantum defense.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="risks-of-shorter-certificate-lifespan"&gt;Risks of shorter certificate lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this gift, intended to strengthen security, could turn into a curse if&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3485437/companies-poorly-prepared-for-tls-transition.html"&gt; organizations are unprepared&lt;/a&gt;. Many still rely on manual tracking and renewal processes, using spreadsheets, calendar reminders, or system admins who “just know” when certificates are due to expire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With so little time until the March 2026 deadline, organizations may find themselves scrambling to modernize certificate management. Some CISOs have begun accelerating automation projects, centralizing certificate inventories, and reassessing where responsibility for certificate lifecycle management sits within their teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As the CISO of a major US bank managing $40 billion in assets, my primary concerns with shrinking SSL/TLS certificate lifespans revolve around operational resilience and the amplification of risks in an already complex financial ecosystem,” says Clint Lawson, CISO at MidFirst Bank. “With lifespans set to drop, the frequency of renewals heightens the potential for human error, certificate sprawl, and undetected expirations that could lead to service disruptions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In banking and other sectors, mistakes in handling this issue can be costly and can translate into loss of revenue or customer trust. “What keeps me up at night is the nightmare scenario of a cascading outage,” Lawson adds. “An expired certificate halting online banking portals during peak hours, exposing us to regulatory scrutiny from bodies like the FDIC or OCC, or worse, providing a foothold for adversaries to exploit unencrypted channels.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the window for preparation is narrowing, companies need to shift gears now and rethink their procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-cisos-are-preparing-for-shorter-certificates-lifespan"&gt;How CISOs are preparing for shorter certificates lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many organizations, CISOs have already started to rethink their approach. The first step for most is simply figuring out what they actually have. That means getting a clear view of every certificate across the environment, instead of relying on scattered notes or pieces of information that different people appear to have.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visibility should be “the absolute first priority,” says Pete Clay, CISO at Aireon. Without a complete and continuously updated inventory of certificates — knowing exactly what certificates exist, where they’re deployed, and what systems depend on them — no amount of automation or tooling will prevent outages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re investing in a living cryptographic inventory that doesn’t just track SSL/TLS certificates, but also keys, algorithms, identities, and their business, risk, and regulatory context within our organization and ties all of that to risk,” he says. “Every cert is tied to an owner, an expiration date, and a system dependency, and supported with continuous lifecycle-based communication with those owners. That inventory drives automated notifications, so no expiration sneaks up on us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second priority should be automation. Clay argues that as certificate lifespans shrink, manual renewal cycles are no longer realistic. His team is moving toward centralized certificate management with automated issuance and renewal, and he recommends others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideally, that means using APIs or workflows that leverage the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol. ACME is an open standard that enables automated interactions between certificate authorities and servers, allowing certificates to be requested, issued, renewed, and replaced programmatically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Certificates are issued, deployed, and validated automatically across environments, whether that’s cloud load balancers, Kubernetes clusters, or on-prem gateways,” Clay says. “The goal is to make renewal a background process, not an emergency project, but &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;supported by communication and accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vira Tkachenko, chief technology and innovation officer at MacPaw, agrees. She explains that her team is using ACME to automate certificate renewals in environments where it is supported, such as their Cloudflare setup and virtual servers with Let’s Encrypt. In areas where ACME is not yet available, they are in the process of establishing a centralized certificate inventory to maintain visibility and prevent unexpected expirations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lawson follows a similar approach at the bank he works for. “First, we deployed enterprise-grade certificate lifecycle management (CLM) platforms with AI-driven automation to handle issuance, renewal, and revocation seamlessly across our hybrid cloud environments,” he says. “Second, we conducted comprehensive audits and built a centralized PKI dashboard that provides real-time visibility into every certificate, correlated with threat intelligence feeds to prioritize high-risk assets.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the bank partnered with leading certificate authorities to pilot post-quantum cryptography integrations. By doing this, they aim to future-proof their infrastructure against emerging quantum threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adapting to shorter certificate lifespans shouldn’t be treated as a one-off technical chore, adds Lawson. These changes need to be woven into the larger digital transformation strategies shaping how organizations secure and operate their systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, the business impact should be communicated clearly, so leadership understands that certificate automation is a must. “An expired certificate isn’t a tech glitch—it’s downtime, lost revenue, and brand damage,” says Clay. “CISOs who frame this as resilience and trust management, not just compliance, get the investment and executive attention they need before the next outage happens.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pro-tips-for-cisos"&gt;Pro tips for CISOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the deadline is approaching, some organizations still do not have a full certificate management strategy in place. “They will be the first to feel the effects of unexpected downtime,” says Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo. Luckily, though, there are things they can pay attention to prevent an outage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While automation is important as certificates expire more quickly, how it is implemented matters. Renewing a certificate a fixed number of days before expiration can become unreliable as lifespans change. The alternative is renewing based on a percentage of the certificate’s lifetime, and this method has an advantage: the timing adjusts automatically when the lifespan shortens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hard-coded renewal periods are likely to be too long at some point, whereas percentage renewal periods should be fine,” says Josh Aas, executive director of the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), the nonprofit entity behind Let’s Encrypt. “For example, an ACME client that renews every 60 days will eventually wait too long once certificate lifetimes are less than that, whereas a client that renews at 70% of a certificate’s lifetime should be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another important step is to set up alerts, adds Clay. Use continuous scanning to detect certificates that are getting close to expiring and send automatic notifications when they need attention. Connect those alerts to your team’s ticketing or chat tools, so they are seen immediately. “It’s not glamorous, but it’s the difference between staying ahead of the problem and getting the 2AM outage call,” Clay says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also helps to have a clearly designated person to oversee certificate lifecycle, ideally, someone in security with responsibility for cryptography or public key infrastructure (PKI). “Fragmented responsibility is what causes outages and finger-pointing,” adds Clay. “Build a single policy that defines how certificates are requested, purchased, approved, renewed, and revoked. Even a lightweight governance model will reduce chaos immediately and reduce your risks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pete Nicoletti, global field CISO at Check Point, adds that CISOs should also make sure everyone is on the same page. That means making sure DevSecOps teams know the basics of good certificate hygiene. He also recommends running expiration tabletop exercises, so rapid response becomes second nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, certificate health needs to be tracked just like any other governance metric. “Include metrics for renewals completed on time, expiring certificates, and key rotation compliance,” Clay adds. “When executives see those numbers trending in the right direction, it reinforces that crypto isn’t just a technical function — it’s a core part of operational resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mistakes-cisos-can-make"&gt;Mistakes CISOs can make&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As certificate lifespans shorten, the pressure to adapt can lead to missteps or blind spots. One of the biggest is assuming the change only affects public-facing websites. “Internal TLS, mTLS, brokers, and device certificates can cause nasty outages because they are not observable [in Certificate Transparency (CT) logs] and often lack ACME paths,” Shattuck says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another common mistake is underestimating the value of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/518982/tabletop-exercise-scenarios.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt;. Soroko recommends scenarios like: ‘We have to revoke and replace all of our certificates in 24-hours due to mis-issuance’, or ‘We have to revoke and replace all of our RSA certificates because RSA has just been deprecated.’ By running these exercises, CISOs can quickly find out if their organization is truly prepared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A third trap is treating shorter certificate lifespans as a purely technical issue, which can be solved by automation alone. This is risky because the cultural and workflow shift required to support continuous renewal is often the hardest part, says Nicoletti. “Without investing in team upskilling and change management, resistance to automation could stall progress, leaving your organization exposed in a landscape where agility is non-negotiable,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, as March 15 approaches, perhaps the biggest mistake CISOs can make is assuming there is still plenty of time to adjust. This isn’t a future problem. The shift is already underway, and organizations that delay will face a much harder transition later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Certificates do not expire unexpectedly,” says Soroko. “They have a stated lifetime that does not change after the certificate is issued.” Taking early action can be the difference between managing certificates predictably and risking an avoidable outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>AI, automation, and integration: The foundation for cyber protection in 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099360/ai-automation-and-integration-the-foundation-for-cyber-protection-in-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber protection grew more complex in 2025 as more threat actors turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to increase their speed, scale, and precision. These autonomous ransomware, phishing, and data exfiltration attacks outpaced legacy tools and exploited gaps between security and backup solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2026, organizations will have to evolve just as quickly, using AI and automation to unify their prevention, detection, response, and recovery strategies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Portrait von zwei Ingenieuren von Frauen und Männern, die Laptop-Computer verwenden, um zu analysieren und zu diskutieren, wie man mit der Software für künstliche Intelligenz weitergeht. Casual Chatting im High Tech Research Office" class="wp-image-4099366" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2287651215_a6722c.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2287651215&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;shutterstock/Gorodenkoff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="escalating-ai-threats"&gt;Escalating AI threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI-driven threats surged in the first half of 2025, according to the Acronis Cyberthreats Report.  Attackers commonly employed deepfake-based social engineering, automated scripts, and AI-generated lures to increase their reach with less manual effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of publicly disclosed ransomware victims increased by nearly 70% compared to 2023 and 2024. And phishing remained the top initial vector, accounting for more than 73% of all incidents. These attacks hit the financial services, healthcare, and professional services industries particularly hard.​​&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, malware developers accelerated their efforts, releasing variants at a record pace. Malware samples averaged a 1.4-day lifespan in early 2025, compared to 2.3 days in late 2023. Tactics such as zero-day exploitation and quieter data theft extortion further challenged manufacturing, retail, and technology organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All told, these threats overwhelmed siloed data protection tools, which lacked the speed and context to counter AI-enhanced attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-response"&gt;The response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2025, some defenders began to respond in kind. By using AI to improve detection and automate responses, they reduced dwell time while accelerating containment and recovery. Others turned to integrated cybersecurity and data protection platforms, which simplified IT operations, consolidated alerting, and helped close the gaps attackers had exploited.​&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although managed service providers (MSPs) remained prime targets because of their privileged access to multiple environments, the number of initial access incidents reported declined by more than 25% — a sign that MSPs using consolidated security solutions were better able to detect and neutralize threats before they spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2026-priorities"&gt;2026 priorities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To remain resilient in 2026, organizations must eliminate silos between cybersecurity, backup, and recovery. Critical priorities include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automation to reduce manual burdens and offset talent shortages;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;zero-trust frameworks, which restrict lateral movement and enforce least-privilege access; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;unified platforms that reduce tool sprawl and integrate detection, response, and remediation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, new regulations such as the European Union Network and Information Security 2 &lt;a href="https://www.acronis.com/en/compliance/?utm_source=arn&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=csoonline-fy25-q4-mixed-amer-nam-en-ba-q4brandq4truba-x-csoonline-a" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;(NIS2) Directive&lt;/a&gt;, plus stricter incident reporting and business continuity requirements, will further push organizations to modernize and centralize their cyber protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-a-unified-defense"&gt;Building a unified defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acronis Cyber Protect Cloud enables this unified approach through a single AI-powered platform. It combines native endpoint detection and response (EDR) with extended detection and response (XDR), offers multitenant management for MSPs and managed security service providers, and integrates backup and recovery to minimize data loss and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By optimizing security management, simplifying compliance, and cutting recovery times across diverse environments, Acronis helps organizations respond to today’s threats while preparing for tomorrow’s challenges.​​&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hybrid 2FA phishing kits are making attacks harder to detect</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4100393/hybrid-2fa-phishing-kits-are-making-attacks-harder-to-detect.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some 2FA-phishing attacks are becoming significantly harder to spot as threat actors blend two previously distinct phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) kits: Salty2FA and Tycoon2FA, into a single hybrid strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Any.Run warn that the hybrid is already bypassing detection rules tuned to either kit alone. Alerts that once reliably caught Salty2FA or Tycoon2FA activity are now going quiet, leaving security teams blind to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3535222/mfa-adoption-is-catching-up-but-is-not-quite-there.html"&gt;MFA&lt;/a&gt;-bypass attacks that previously triggered obvious signatures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ &lt;a href="https://any.run/cybersecurity-blog/salty2fa-tycoon2fa-hybrid-phishing-2025/"&gt;code-level analysis confirmed hybrid payloads&lt;/a&gt;, they said in a blog post. “Early stages matched Salty2FA, while later stages reproduced Tycoon2FA’s execution chain almost line-for-line,” they wrote. “This overlap marks a meaningful shift; one that weakens kit-specific rules, complicates attribution, and gives threat actors more room to slip past early detection.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Salty2FA and Tycoon2FA are multi-factor-authentication-bypassing kits that capture user credentials and session data through multi-stage, deceptive logic flows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any.Run advised security leaders not to rely on static indicators as the hybrid execution flows they observed can only be spotted by closely watching the behavior patterns and fallback routines of the new strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tycoon-revived-a-faltering-salty"&gt;Tycoon revived a faltering Salty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, the emergence of this hybrid phishing strain coincides with a sharp drop in pure Salty2FA activity. By November 2025, Salty2FA-related submissions to Any.Run’s sandbox &lt;a href="https://x.com/anyrun_app/status/1988139884796600506"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt; from hundreds per week to just a handful (51 in total).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it looked like the framework was being abandoned, it was just morphing to fall back to Tycoon2FA whenever its original infrastructure ran into issues. “One analysis showed the use of ASP.NET CDN, which is not typical for Salty2FA kit,” the researchers said. “It started to look as if someone had flipped a switch and taken a significant part of the framework’s infrastructure offline.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But rather than a total shut down, samples soon began throwing detections for both Salty2FA and Tycoon2FA. Eventually, the hybrid payloads started with familiar Salty elements including code obfuscation, “trampoline” JavaScript, and domain patterns, and then shifted into Tycoon2FA’s execution chain including DGA-based domains and Adversary-in-the-Middle (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3604557/how-to-defend-microsoft-networks-from-adversary-in-the-middle-attacks.html"&gt;AiTM&lt;/a&gt;) behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the overlap will complicate signature-based detection, and rules tuned to Salty or Tycoon alone may now miss the hybrid entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Defending against the two-pronged attack&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For defenders, this means attribution becomes murkier, hunting hypotheses weaker, and earlier detection far harder. Any.Run warned that reliance on static indicators of compromise such as domains and URLs is no longer sufficient; they now need to watch behavior patterns, fallback routines, and hybrid execution flows for signs of campaign activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If Salty infrastructure becomes unavailable, the same campaign may pivot into Tycoon2FA without leaving a clear break,” the researchers noted. “Threat hunting should look for those transitions to avoid missing supporting evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rise of hybrid 2FA phishing kits should prepare defenders for campaigns that operate more flexibly, more modularly, and with a higher tolerance for infrastructure failure, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the Salty2FA campagn had been in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053744/phishing-kit-salty2fa-washes-away-confidence-in-mfa.html"&gt;full swing&lt;/a&gt;, breaching MFA protections with a mix of advanced tactics, including cloaking within trusted platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4003056/new-phishing-campaign-hijacks-clipboard-via-fake-captcha-for-malware-delivery.html#:~:text=Cloudflare%20Turnstile%20interface"&gt;Cloudflare Turnstile&lt;/a&gt;. Its merging with Tycoon2FA is a serious threat, considering how the latter is already &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3850783/11-ways-cybercriminals-are-making-phishing-more-potent-than-ever.html?utm=hybrid_search#:~:text=89%%20of%20observed%20PhaaS"&gt;blamed&lt;/a&gt; for almost 90% of recent PhaaS incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coach or mentor: What you need depends on where you are as a cyber leader</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099036/coach-or-mentor-what-you-need-depends-on-where-you-are-as-a-cyber-leader.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/renee-guttmann/"&gt;Renee Guttmann&lt;/a&gt;, a Fortune 50 CISO who has served at Time Warner, Coca-Cola, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and other global organizations, gives back by helping others advance along their CISO career paths. Early in her own career, there were no seasoned CISOs to guide her. That motivates her to mentor professionals both within cybersecurity and those looking to enter the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had mentors early in my career, especially as my teams grew and my interactions with senior executives increased,” she says. “The key message is that it’s okay to ask for help. It’s not a sign of weakness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a September ISSA LA meeting, Guttmann and one of her mentees presented to a full room about mentoring and coaching, sharing personal experiences. “Attendees could have gone to other sessions, but they chose ours. Why? Because the need in our industry is so great,” she explains. “Executive coaching and mentoring are common in other fields — so why not in cybersecurity?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the session, she outlined the distinction between mentoring and coaching and why professionals may need both at different stages of their careers. Mentoring, she says, is typically a one-on-one relationship focused on sharing real-world experience. During COVID-19, for example, she helped a mentee address an employee secretly working two jobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With another mentee, she recognized the need for improved executive presence and recommended working with a coach. Guttmann faced a similar challenge early in her own career, and her CIO arranged for her to receive executive coaching. Her coach recommended books, facilitated role-playing sessions, and even encouraged her to take a two-day acting class to build confidence in delivering difficult news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-to-find-coaches-and-mentors"&gt;Where to find coaches and mentors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many potential mentees connect with Guttmann through networking events or professional platforms like LinkedIn. She also participates in formal mentoring programs, including one that involved twenty mentees and ten prominent cybersecurity executives. It has monthly 90-minute training sessions and additional one-on-one meetings. These conversations often focus on career advancement and navigating sensitive workplace situations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some mentees find mentors within their own organizations. Others connect through industry-specific IT groups in sectors such as healthcare, energy, or government. Professional organizations including IANS and Deloitte also offer mentoring and coaching programs designed to help CISOs build the business acumen necessary for board-level engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the growing demand, Guttmann expects executive recruiters to also begin partnering with experts to develop formal mentoring and coaching services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a mentor, she evaluates whether her experience aligns with a mentee’s needs and ensures the relationship is built on trust, respect, and confidentiality. Mentors and mentees typically meet monthly via videoconference, creating a safe environment to discuss peers, employees, HR issues, and leadership challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once mentees meet their goals, formal meetings conclude — ideally with the mentee eventually “paying it forward.” For example, one of Guttmann’s former mentees is already establishing a mentoring program within their own organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-good-technical-base-can-last-decades"&gt;A good technical base can last decades&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While mentees need the most help with aligning to the business, some argue that a technical baseline is equally as important to the role for managing technical staff and enabling business operations, particularly through innovative technologies like cloud and AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of those is &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-madden-841121161/"&gt;Cynthia Madden&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Artemis Enterprise. “The well-rounded CISO needs an equal balance of technical and business acumen,” she explains. “For example, if a new technology brings specific business risks with it, the CISO needs to understand how to meet the business objective within the business’s approved risk tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, Madden found most of her mentors in the workplace. Her first mentor (a “brilliant” technologist from MIT) helped her understand the basics of neural networks and how to interact with them programmatically. She used her core programming skills in Visual Basic with ODBC to connect to his neural network to predict inventory for a pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under this apprenticeship, she learned how to bridge the needs of the business, inventory expirations, and manage costs — in that case using an early form of artificial intelligence. That mentorship proved to be valuable thirty years later for assessing AI adoption capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She found more technical mentors when she pivoted to government, where she applied her masters in cybersecurity to conduct cyber exercises and testing against missile defense facilities. There, too, she felt more technically mentored. But she also learned about mission, responsibility, chain of command, ethics, and more business-related knowledge that serves her today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those government mentors were enduring. For me, mentoring people in cyber space is about an extended relationship over time. It’s a trust position to do that, both in the government and private sector. So those become many years-long relationships,” Madden explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of all the things she found mentors for, she needed the most direction around balancing her strong sense of ethics with her employers’ ethics, especially when employers put profits over people. For that, she’s currently in a coaching program learning to balance these nuances in a healthy, informed way by building paths where both people and profit thrive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And she pays it forward through her classroom mentoring program, “Girls in Cyber,” on Oahu in her home state of Hawaii, where she helps girls in grades four through twelve build technical skillsets that may someday serve as a baseline for their own leadership roles in cyber.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="becoming-a-business-leader"&gt;Becoming a business leader&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For mentees from technical backgrounds to grow they ultimately need to step away from their hands-on technical roles and learn executive leadership. But letting go of control is often the most difficult step for would-be CISO’s to make, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgegerchow/"&gt;George Gerchow&lt;/a&gt;, CSO at Bedrock Data. As a long-time faculty member at IANS, he’s seen this often while working one-on-one with CISO’s (as well as through classroom instruction) under the IANS CISO &lt;a href="https://www.iansresearch.com/what-we-do/professional-development/ciso-executive-coaching"&gt;executive coaching program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At some point, they’ve got to let go of that technical role in order to step into different business roles and grow,” Gerchow notes. “The reason why so many CISOs don’t get board seats is because they lack understanding of the way a business works, including its strategic positioning and the business longevity plan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his own CISO roles at Sumo Logic and MongoDB, Gerchow had direct access to the board, which gives him valuable experience to share in his trainings. To that end, Gerchow feels more like a mentor than a coach. “I love working with people who are up and coming, looking to brand themselves and get into different positions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also mentored many people in his former workplaces. As he prepared to leave Sumo Logic, he mentored his deputy CISO by putting his “feet in the fire.” He worked with the deputy CISO to create documentation for the board, hold staff meetings, and co-present to the board. “Automating myself out of a job – to me that’s mentoring. Coaching, on the other hand, is more about goal setting and planning a career path. Both are equally needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mentoring-is-about-the-what-while-coaching-is-about-the-how"&gt;Mentoring is about the ‘what’ while coaching is about the ‘how’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like others, Upen Sachdev, principal partner at Deloitte, rose from the technical ranks to direct security, compliance and risk management for a large global brand, after which he was a CISO for seven years at another large global brand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sachdev found help with mentors as he ascended in his career. But while working with clients at Deloitte, he saw a gap in business leadership skills among what he calls the “next generation of CISOs.” So he helped create Deloitte’s &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/programs/chief-information-officer/services/ciso-program-offerings-resources.html"&gt;CISO program&lt;/a&gt; with his peers, which Deloitte offers at no cost to selected candidates from the Deloitte client base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mentors will show you the light because they have walked the path before. They will tell you what to do, which mountain to climb,” he says. “Our job as coaches is to help them understand the how. How do you improve your storytelling skills? How can you have a better executive presence? How do you lead your leaders? And how do you enable the business?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the program’s nearly 100 alumni, most of them now rock their executive-level roles. They’re expanding their networks and paying it back, he says. “Our community wants to give back, invest time, connect with, listen to, and support people in advancing in their careers,” Sachdev says. “In some ways, they’ve also coached me back. They’ve made me a better listener, a better teammate, and hopefully a better human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
