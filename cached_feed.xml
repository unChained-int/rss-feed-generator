      <title>Extortion gang opens data leak site to squeeze victims of its Salesforce attacks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067846/extortion-gang-opens-data-leak-site-to-squeeze-victims-of-its-salesforce-attacks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters gang, which says it has stolen data from the Salesforce instances of dozens of international companies in recent months, upped its extortion game today by listing their names on a new data leak site. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of alleged victims includes Salesforce itself, from which the gang claims it has captured about 1 billion records. Others included Toyota Motor Corp., FedEx, Disney/Hulu, UPS, Home Depot, hotel chain owner Marriott, car manufacturer Stellantis, US retailer Walgreens, McDonalds, Cisco Systems, Google Adsense and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of the named victims have been given until October 10 to pay up, or the copied data will be released.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of Salesforce, the gang is threatening to do more: “Complying” with law firms that are pursuing civil and commercial litigation for alleged irresponsibility against the customer relationship management platform for the alleged data thefts, about which Salesforce and its customers had been warned by the gang for months before the data leak site was unveiled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example,” the gang’s notice to Salesforce says, “we e-mail taunted you … in July 2025 and you never took any further preventative action to stop us. This especially proves our point, it would be bad if we went public with this and showed proof.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gang even says its documents will be provided to the “United States District of Northern District of California” [presumably meaning the United States District Court for the Northern District of California] to possibly prosecute Salesforce. As part of that action, the gang promises we will engage in open dialogue with our press contacts, civil/commercial litigation lawyers, and answering any questions asked.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As you know, all of this can be avoided,” the gang’s message to Salesforce reads. “Very easily and swiftly. To reiterate, we have full access to your systems; should the ransom demand not be met, your data will be released in full. Should you comply, we will withdraw from any active or pending negotiation individually from your customers. Your customers will not be attacked again nor will they face a ransom from us again, should you pay. We are able to thoroughly elaborate more on this if you engage with us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="who-is-this-group"&gt;Who is this group?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some background: According to&lt;a href="https://www.emsisoft.com/en/blog/author/luke/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Luke Connolly&lt;/a&gt;, a threat researcher at Emsisoft, this extortion group is an apparent loose affiliation between a number of relatively unstructured cybercriminal groups including ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$ and The Com, and sometimes works under one name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unveiling of the Salesforce victims data leak site wasn’t unexpected. Last month, Connolly said the group launched a new Telegram channel pre-announcing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="salesforce-statement"&gt;Salesforce statement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an online statement yesterday — the day before the data leak site was launched – &lt;a href="https://status.salesforce.com/generalmessages/20000224?locale=en-US." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Salesforce said&lt;/a&gt;,  “we are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vishing-attack"&gt;Vishing attack&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Salesforce spokesperson referred to a June warning from the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) about activity from a group it calls UNC6040 that had attacked one of its corporate Salesforce instances. This group has consistently claimed to be ShinyHunters, which specializes in impersonating IT staff in voice phishing (vishing) calls to trick employees into giving away access to Salesforce databases, the GTIG report says, by getting victims to authorize the connection of a malicious app to their organization’s Salesforce portal. This application is often a modified version of Salesforce’s Data Loader, not one authorized by Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the vishing call, the hacker guides the victim to Salesforce’s connected app setup page to approve a malicious version of the Data Loader app, with a name or branding that differs from the legitimate version. This gives hacker the ability to access, query, and exfiltrate sensitive information directly from the compromised Salesforce customer environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some instances, the GTIG report adds, extortion activities haven’t been observed until several months after the initial UNC6040 intrusion activity, which could suggest that UNC6040 has partnered with a second threat actor that monetizes access to the stolen data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the report, Google also says that one of its Salesforce instances, used to store contact information and related notes for small and medium businesses, was compromised with a similar tactic by this gang. Data was retrieved by the threat actor “during a small window of time” before access was cut off, Google says. “The data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="linked-to-salesloft-drift-attacks"&gt;Linked to Salesloft Drift attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250912.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the FBI issued a Flash alert&lt;/a&gt; about the compromises of Salesforce instances by UNC6040 and UNC6395. Both groups have recently been targeting organizations’ Salesforce platforms via various initial access mechanisms. However, the FBI alert says, UNC6395 has been using a tactic other than vishing. It is leveraging compromised OAuth tokens for Salesloft Drift, an AI chatbot that integrates not only with the Salesloft sales engagement platform, but also with Salesforce. That’s how UNC6395 was able to get Salesforce customers’ data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On August 20, Salesloft, in collaboration with Salesforce, revoked all Drift active access and refresh tokens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kelacyber.com/blog/token-hijack-the-drift-salesforce-breach-that-shook-saas/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a September analysis&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Israel-based Kela called the Salesloft Drift campaign “one of the most significant SaaS supply chain compromises to date.” The stolen OAuth and refresh tokens from Drift were designed to synchronize data between Drift and Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tokens can bypass primary authentication methods, including multi-factor authentication, Kela notes. In this campaign, the attackers could maintain persistent access, and generated new session tokens over 10 days. From there, UNC6395 pivoted into Salesforce environments. Using Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL), the Kela report says, the attackers searched for high-value secrets, such as AWS access keys, Snowflake tokens, and passwords, that are often embedded in support cases and customer records. Stolen data was then routed through TOR and cloud VPS infrastructure (including AWS and DigitalOcean) to obscure the exfiltration. The attackers also attempted to clean up logs by deleting query jobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This approach highlights a growing trend,” said Kela. “Attackers are not stealing entire CRM datasets but targeting the crown jewels hidden in SaaS platforms: credentials that open the door to broader cloud and enterprise systems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kela says victim firms in this campaign included Akamai, Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Bugcrowd, Proofpoint, Zscaler, Tanium, and Workiva. Data stolen included contact information, support ticket data, and compromised API tokens, depending on the victim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesloft said in September that an &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/data-theft-salesforce-instances-via-salesloft-drift" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;investigation by Google’s Mandiant incident response unit&lt;/a&gt; showed this campaign started with UNC6395 accessing Salesloft’s GitHub account between March and June. That allowed the download of content from multiple repositories. In addition, the threat actor added a guest user to the account.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights-a-broader-issue"&gt;Highlights a broader issue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/briansoby/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brian Soby&lt;/a&gt;, chief technology officer and co-founder of AppOmni, called the threat by the hackers to assist in legal action against Salesforce “unusual. To our knowledge, it is the first time an attacker has threatened to participate in or leverage existing litigation against the vendor of a compromised platform and its native security tools as part of an extortion campaign. While attackers often pressure customers of a breached product, using lawsuits to increase leverage on the vendor represents a novel escalation.,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he said, “at the same time, it’s important to note that ShinyHunters gained access through phishing and stolen customer user credentials, enabling compromise of customer Salesforce instances. Under the &lt;a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2024/01/25/what-is-the-shared-responsibility-model-in-the-cloud" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shared Responsibility model&lt;/a&gt;, preventing and detecting such activity falls squarely within the customer’s domain. This makes the legal theories driving these lawsuits questionable at best.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that these incidents highlight a broader issue, noting, “many SaaS customers have yet to adopt the tools and practices necessary to effectively meet their Shared Responsibility obligations. What is novel here is the attempt to frame alleged negligence not just against customers, but against the vendor and its native, first-party security tools.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="with-salesloft-they-got-lucky"&gt;‘With Salesloft they got lucky’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sans.edu/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Johannes Ullrich,&lt;/a&gt; dean of research at the SANS Institute, told &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt; that Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is “more of a conglomerate/collective of members of various other groups like Scattered Spider and Lapsus$. The techniques they employ are heavy on social engineering, but with Salesloft, they got lucky in the sense that they were able to leverage their access into Salesloft’s systems to gain access to various companies’ Salesforce data.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salesloft’s sales chatbot, to be effective, must interface with Salesforce and other systems using credentials created by the customer. “The attackers stole those credentials from Salesloft and used them to access Salesforce instances of affected companies,” he said. “Any company running the Salesloft agent is potentially at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bigger picture, he added, is that this was a software supply chain attack. Modern distributed software uses web services APIs just as traditional software used libraries, Ullrich noted. But, he said, APIs are more difficult to protect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Users of these APIs are usually not able to effectively test them, so they place a lot of trust in the companies operating them,” he explained. “The best strategy is to limit your exposure by carefully weighing the risk of an API against the potential benefit it will provide. Any access provided to these remote systems should be carefully tailored to the problem they are trying to solve. However, for example, in the case of Salesloft, its chatbot tool required quite far-reaching access to be useful, and the attackers took advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ever-changing cybersecurity landscape has long kept CISOs on their toes and now AI is bringing new challenges in how security teams operate and innovate. In some cases, the technology is even changing how they are perceived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI capabilities are increasingly being used in cybersecurity programs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/articles/future-of-cyber-survey-2024.html"&gt;Deloitte’s Future of Cyber Survey&lt;/a&gt; of US cyber decision-makers, with 43% of respondents using AI in their cybersecurity programs to a large extent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is helping CISOs gain more influence among an increasingly cyber-savvy C-suite: Almost one-third of respondents noted CISO involvement in strategic conversations about tech investment, the Deloitte survey says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the change is gradual, stresses &lt;a href="https://www.plantemoran.com/get-to-know/people/joe-oleksak"&gt;Joe Oleksak&lt;/a&gt;, a partner at Plante Moran, an accounting and wealth management consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“After almost 30 years of cybersecurity consulting, I can say with confidence that AI hasn’t revolutionized security organizations — but it is gradually reshaping how they operate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest change Oleksak has seen is the growing realization that speed has become the defining factor. Security teams cannot take their foot off the pedal though and think that AI is a magic bullet, he contends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI accelerates everything, both attacks and defenses, which means the fundamentals matter more than ever,” Oleksak says. “Provisioning, permissions, network segmentation, even what information is stored in shared folders must be closely managed, because AI magnifies every mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where discipline comes in. “Organizations that have invested in security over time are seeing efficiencies by layering AI-driven tools into their workflows,” Oleksak says. “But those who haven’t taken security seriously are still stuck with the same exposures they’ve always had. AI doesn’t magically catch them up.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, because attackers are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4014238/cybercriminals-take-malicious-ai-to-the-next-level.html"&gt;using AI to make phishing, scanning, and deepfakes cheaper and faster&lt;/a&gt;, Oleksak adds, the gap between mature and unprepared organizations is widening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at how CISOs are re-examining their security organizations to keep up with the pace and potential of AI as the technology becomes a more frequent part of their strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="shifting-c-suite-dynamics"&gt;Shifting C-suite dynamics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deneendefiore/"&gt;Deneen DeFiore&lt;/a&gt;, vice president and CISO at United Airlines, says that unequivocally AI has changed the nature of her relationship with the rest of the C-suite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI has elevated cybersecurity into a strategic business conversation. I’m working more closely with other executives to ensure security is built into AI initiatives from the start,” she says. “It’s no longer just about protecting infrastructure — it’s about enabling innovation safely, building trust, and helping the business move faster with confidence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shift has also occurred, she says, because of the airline’s commitment to responsible AI. “We’re focused on deploying AI ethically and transparently, with cybersecurity playing a central role in ensuring accountability, fairness, and resilience. This shared responsibility across the C-suite is reshaping how we lead and how we innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deneen DeFiore stylized" class="wp-image-507651" src="https://legacy-us-images.foundryco.app/images/idge/imported/imageapi/2023/05/25/10/deneen-defiore-stylized_1600x900px-100941429-orig.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;United Airlines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of this shift has to do with organizations having already seen what happens when security is treated as an afterthought, Oleksak notes. This occurred across the industry during the rollout of the internet in the 1990s, and Oleksak believes AI can follow the same pattern if C-suite dynamics don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We cannot afford to repeat those mistakes,” he says. “For AI to be deployed responsibly, the CISO must be at the center of strategy and execution. A security-first approach, led by the CISO, and sponsored by executive management, is the only way to ensure AI strengthens rather than undermines the enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reshaping-cyber-it-collaboration"&gt;Reshaping cyber-IT collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advent of AI has also changed how IT works with the security organization, shifting the focus from reactive security to proactive, strategic collaboration, DeFiore says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re now embedding cybersecurity into AI initiatives from the start, working closely across teams to ensure innovation is both safe and ethical,” she stresses. “Our commitment to responsible AI means every solution is designed with transparency, fairness, and accountability in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonlander/"&gt;Jason Lander&lt;/a&gt;, senior vice president of product management at Aya Healthcare, who manages security for the organization, is also seeing a change in the dynamics between cybersecurity and IT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI is noticeably reshaping how security and IT departments collaborate, streamline workflows, blend responsibilities, make decisions and redefine trust dynamics,” he says. “Our IT operations have become more intelligent and proactive. Our security team is gaining operational support and better visibility.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Plante Moran’s Oleksak doesn’t believe AI has significantly changed how most security organizations work with IT, the technology has begun to shift expectations incrementally, he’s seen. “IT teams increasingly assume security can move faster because AI accelerates analysis and detection, and boards are starting to see the CISO as a more strategic role,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Oleksak doesn’t think there is enough recognition that the CISO brings a fundamentally different perspective than IT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“IT’s focus is on speed, efficiency, and enabling the business, while the CISO’s focus is on protecting the business. That distinction is often misunderstood,” he maintains. “As AI introduces powerful new risks, from deepfakes and AI-driven phishing to employees unintentionally exposing sensitive IP through AI queries, only the CISO is positioned to anticipate and mitigate these threats.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillknesek/"&gt;Jill Knesek&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of BlackLine, reports to the financial software company’s CIO. As she sees it the teams have always worked closely, but AI has taken that relationship to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now, we have to be aligned on everything we do,” says Knesek, who was previously an FBI agent in the Cyber Crimes Squad and CISO of Mattel. This is because AI tools add risk and allow for opportunities, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="transforming-the-nature-of-work"&gt;Transforming the nature of work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is enabling various improvements at Aya Healthcare, including the ability to streamline and automate repetitive tasks, Lander says, thereby evolving how security work gets done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI tools help retrieve data faster and expedite decision-making, which frees up team members’ time to focus on more strategic challenges,” he says. “We continue to upskill and train employees on new AI processes and tools, streamline systems integrations, identify immediate threat detection quicker, improve processes, and ensure a greater focus on overall security, and data governance and access.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;United Airline’s DeFiore echoes that, saying AI now handles the noise by triaging alerts, surfacing anomalies, and automating repetitive tasks. This enables her security team to focus on strategic analysis, threat modeling, and resilience planning. “It’s made our operations faster, more focused, and more impactful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lander says AI has even reshaped his daily work by placing an emphasis on process automation, prompting him to reassess past organizational choices and enhance strategic priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It requires a deeper knowledge in governance and risk, aligning AI capabilities with business objectives and balancing innovation with risk management,” he explains. “All of the investments we’re making at Aya are 100% mission-driven. Our innovative technologies ensure hospitals and healthcare facilities have the very best clinician when and where they’re needed most, while giving them time to focus on what’s most-important: patient care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BlackLine’s Knesek is zeroing in on her security operations team as the biggest use case for AI because it requires a lot of overhead. Blackline has its own 24/7 security operations, and Knesek plans to put some security operations engineers in the company’s India office to get better coverage overnight and on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s one area where we’re going to leverage the AI capability so we don’t have to hire as many people to provide that level of coverage across the globe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The adoption of AI tools at Plante Moran “reflects a simple reality: The best way to combat AI-enabled threats is often with AI-enabled defenses,” Oleksak says. But as with all cybersecurity initiatives, technology is only one part of the solution, he points out. A sound defense begins with training and culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve made a deliberate effort to educate all employees on both the capabilities and the risks of AI, so they understand why our security protocols and policies matter,” Oleksak says. “We don’t want employees to fear AI — it’s software, and like all software it has vulnerabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like United Airline’s DeFiore, Oleksak says that what matters is how responsibly AI is used. AI tools can help employees move faster, but people need to remember the basics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, with deepfake voice farming now able to mimic executives, simple ‘old-school’ security practices like confirming instructions by phone are more important than ever,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though AI hasn’t changed the size or structure of security teams at the consultancy, it has changed the focus of their work: less on repetitive triage, more on judgment, communication, and reinforcing a culture of security, Oleksak says. “It’s made training, culture, and old-fashioned good judgment more important than ever.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-cybersecurity-a-more-expansive-effort"&gt;Making cybersecurity a more expansive effort&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the complexities AI has introduced is the need to validate the technology and service providers’ own cybersecurity preparedness and processes — which has become a more expansive effort due to AI, Oleksak says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Deepfakes present enterprises with very real dangers, and they will only grow more prevalent,” he explains. “We are no exception and implemented redundant, often manual protocols to address these risks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Aya Healthcare’s Lander, AI has introduced a host of new opportunities his teams are looking at. “We’re rethinking and redefining sensitive data. We’re also adopting better detection models and practices for distinguishing between human- and bot-generated behavior,” he says, adding that security professionals are also monitoring and planning for increased risk of security leaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At United Airlines, teams are being reorganized “to bring together threat analysts, engineers, and data scientists in more agile, collaborative pods,” DeFiore says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re hiring selectively for AI and machine learning expertise, but we’re also investing in our existing talent — training them to understand how AI works, how to validate models, and how to use these tools responsibly,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="feeling-the-pressure-to-work-fast"&gt;Feeling the pressure to work fast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knesek remains concerned about AI’s unknowns, yet she says companies are pushing security teams to quickly build out new capabilities so they can say they have AI embedded in their products. Security and IT are “kind of the transportation team to lay the roads and guardrails so things don’t spin out of control,” she says. “We’re working at breakneck speed in some areas and the reality is, we don’t know exactly what the threats are. So, we’re trying to make sure that we’ve got the strongest rules in place.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Jill Knesek, CISO, BlackLine" class="wp-image-4066740" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/jill-knesek-stylized-1600x900px.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Knesek, CISO, BlackLine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;BlackLine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Echoing Oleksak, Knesek says she feels strongly about utilizing traditional security and having the right controls in place. Getting foundational security right will get you a long way, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘Then, as you learn about more sophisticated attacks … we’ll have to pivot our tooling and capabilities to those risks.” For now, “the most important thing for us is just to stay aligned with where the business is driving us very quickly [and] make sure today [security] is doing what it needs to do from a foundational standpoint,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="questioning-the-output"&gt;Questioning the output&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As organizations rethink their approach to security, Oleksak advises CISOs to not get “dazzled by the hype,” and remember that AI is not a strategy but a tool. “Treat it like any other technology investment,” he says. “Start with your risk priorities, then decide where AI can realistically help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means remembering AI magnifies strengths and weaknesses. “If your asset inventory is incomplete, if your IAM controls are loose, or if your patching cadence is poor, AI will not fix those problems; it will accelerate the mess,” Oleksak says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to take a cautious approach to deployment. He advises piloting AI tools in narrow use cases — such as for alert triage, log analysis, and phishing detection — and measuring outcomes. “Focus on augmenting human judgment, not replacing it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams will also build trust through transparency. “Train your teams to question AI output and educate your executives and employees on both the benefits and risks,” Oleksak says. “The CISO’s job is not just to deploy AI tools, but to ensure the organization understands how they fit into the bigger security picture.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-coalitions"&gt;Building coalitions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI should be used where it helps reduce risk, improve speed, or strengthen resilience, says DeFiore. “Build partnerships early — especially with legal, data, and operations teams,” she says. “Invest in education across the organization and stay grounded in ethics. AI decisions have real-world consequences, so organizations should use AI with care and consider potential accountability implications related to how it’s used.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI is a powerful tool, DeFiore says it’s people who make it meaningful. “At United, safety is our foundation. AI helps us deliver on that promise with more precision and agility — but it’s the human judgment behind it that drives trust, impact and long-term value,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is not something to be feared, but its singular impact on security must be respected, says Oleksak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lander emphasizes the need to recognize that AI isn’t just a new tool but also “a new domain that requires careful governance, thoughtful integration, strategic thinking, and continuous learning. By embedding security from day one, engaging cross-functional stakeholders, anticipating unique AI risks, and investing in people and adaptive frameworks, CISOs can guide their organizations to responsibly and confidently harness AI’s potential.” He recommends that CISOs should plan and prepare for the AI era by building coalitions, ensuring AI is not managed as a silo, but as a shared responsibility. “The next few years will require an open mind and a view that AI is like a new member of the team who makes everyone better,” Lander says. “The CISO of the future is not just securing systems, they’re securing AI-enabled business success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
