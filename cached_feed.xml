      <title>Meet ConsentFix, a new twist on the ClickFix phishing attack</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105230/meet-consentfix-a-new-twist-on-the-clickfix-phishing-attack.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new variation of the ClickFix scam tries to get around phishing defenses by capturing an employee’s OAuth authentication token for Microsoft logins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pushsecurity.com/blog/consentfix/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at Push Security this week outlined the tactic&lt;/a&gt;, which they call ConsentFix, in a blog, calling it “a dangerous evolution of ClickFix and consent phishing that is incredibly hard for traditional security tools to detect and block.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4096241/new-clickfix-attacks-use-fake-windows-update-screens-to-fool-employees.html" target="_blank"&gt;ClickFix&lt;/a&gt; attacks display a fake error or counterfeit CAPTCHA verification to a user to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4016208/sixfold-surge-of-clickfix-attacks-threatens-corporate-defenses.html" target="_blank"&gt;get them to copy, paste and execute malicious commands&lt;/a&gt; on their devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s new in a ConsentFix attack is that the attack happens entirely inside a browser, say the researchers, which removes one of the key detection opportunities because the attack doesn’t touch an endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack starts with a victim coming across a legitimate but compromised website they are looking for in a Google search, which completely circumvents email-based anti-phishing controls. Going to the site triggers a fake Cloudflare CAPTCHA-like verification page asking the victim to enter their business email address to prove they’re human. Doing so makes a Microsoft login page pop up which includes a legitimate URL, based on the victim’s email address, that would contain an OAuth token. The victim is asked to copy and paste that URL into a field, again, to verify they are human. The URL is captured by the threat actor, at which point the victim has granted the attacker access to their Microsoft account via Azure’s command line interface, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At this point, the attacker has effective control of the victim’s Microsoft account, but without ever needing to phish a password, or pass an MFA (multifactor authentication) check,” says Push Security. “In fact, if the user was already logged in to their Microsoft account (i.e. they had an active session) no login is required at all.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cybercrimeanalytics.com/about/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christopher Kayser&lt;/a&gt;, social engineering expert and president of Canadian-based firm Cybercrime Analytics, says the attack plays on two tactics favored by threat actors: obedience (cut and paste this URL) and trust (this looks like a Microsoft login page). “People think because they are on a trusted [Microsoft] platform that this is OK,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this attack also shows the failures of security awareness training that many organizations perform. If training is effective, employees should suspect there’s something wrong when an app asks for a business email address to confirm they are human, he said, and know that it’s suspicious when they’re asked to cut and paste anything online as a way of proving they are human.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an incredibly new, innovative attack method,” commented Roger Grimes, data-driven defense CISO advisor at KnowBe4. “It’s almost unfair to classify it as a Clickfix subvariant, even though it is.” However, the odds an employee will copy a long URL string as a test of their humanity has to be very, very low, he added. “It screams different and scammy even to the most unknowledgeable user. Can you see your grandparents doing this? Not me. But I’m sure some people do do it, or else the scammers would not try it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My guess is that its rate of success is so, so low that it doesn’t become a popular scam method that most of us need to worry about,” he said. “What we do need to communicate to users is how often Cloudflare’s brand is being used in social engineering scams, and what the correct Cloudflare authentication/validation looks like. The Cloudflare CAPTCHA check has become the fake antivirus screen of today’s world.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations must recognize that the ConsentFix attack highlights the dangers of implicit trust in first-party applications, and in the continued use of legacy OAuth scopes, said &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/b9cb00be7b" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Avivah Litan&lt;/a&gt;, lead analyst for AI trust, risk and security management at Gartner. These include older permission sets within Microsoft Entra ID that grant broad access and are not subject to modern security controls or monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Attackers exploit these legacy scopes to enumerate directory data, meaning they can systematically retrieve and map out user accounts, groups, and other directory objects within the organization,” she said. “This reconnaissance enables attackers to identify high-value targets and plan further attacks, all without triggering alerts that would be associated with newer, more tightly controlled permissions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The most effective mitigation strategy to this kind of attack is a combination of robust monitoring, strengthened consent governance and real-time user protection, Litan noted. “By addressing these foundational issues — specifically, by limiting the use of legacy OAuth scopes, tightening consent processes for all applications, and deploying browser-based security — enterprises can substantially reduce the risk of unauthorized access resulting from OAuth consent abuse and enhance their overall identity security posture.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Push Security notes that the attack could be successful because targeting a first-party app like Azure CLI means that many of the mitigating controls available for third-party app integrations don’t apply. Because there’s no login required, phishing-resistant authentication controls like passkeys have no impact on this attack, the researchers add. And the use of advanced detection evasion techniques makes this attack difficult to investigate, meaning these attacks are going undetected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the problems is that most security awareness training isn’t doing enough to lower the odds of employees falling for phishing scams, said Kayser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He cited a study of phishing messages sent to employees at a California hospital over a period of eight months. Those who had taken a cybersecurity awareness course were just as likely to have fallen for a phishing message as those who didn’t, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Training often fails because instructors talk too much in technical terms, he said. Instead they should explain attacks, how they work and how to recognize them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you can explain to people what’s going on, that sticks,” he maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>OpenAI expands ‘defense in depth’ security to stop hackers using its AI models to launch cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105279/openai-expands-defense-in-depth-security-to-stop-hackers-using-its-ai-models-to-launch-cyberattacks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI is preparing for the possibility that threat groups will try to abuse its increasingly powerful AI frontier models to carry out sophisticated cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a blog, the &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/strengthening-cyber-resilience/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company describes&lt;/a&gt; how the evolving capabilities of its models could be used to “develop working zero-day remote exploits against well-defended systems, or meaningfully assist with complex, stealthy enterprise or industrial intrusion operations aimed at real-world effects.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to OpenAI, the underlying problem is that offensive and defensive uses of AI rely on the same knowledge and techniques. This makes it challenging to enable one without making possible the other. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are investing in safeguards to help ensure these powerful capabilities primarily benefit defensive uses and limit uplift for malicious purposes,” the company said, adding, “we see this work not as a one-time effort, but as a sustained, long-term investment in giving defenders an advantage and continually strengthening the security posture of the critical infrastructure across the broader ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One new initiative is the Frontier Risk Council. The company offered few details of how this will operate, but said it was part of an expanding “defense in depth” strategy designed to contain the widely-speculated potential of AI as an adversarial tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Members will advise on the boundary between useful, responsible capability and potential misuse, and these learnings will directly inform our evaluations and safeguards. We will share more on the council soon” OpenAI said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other initiatives mentioned in the blog include expanding guardrails against misuse, external Red Team testing to assess model security, and a trusted access program designed to give qualifying customers access to enhanced models to explore defensive use cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also plans to expand its use of its recently announced &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aardvark Agentic Security Researcher scanning tool&lt;/a&gt; beta to identify vulnerabilities in its codebase and suggest patches or mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="red-teaming-ai"&gt;Red Teaming AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI companies find themselves under increasing pressure to explain how they will block model misuse. The anxiety is not hypothetical; last month, OpenAI rival &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4092571/ai-controlled-cyber-attack-causes-a-stir.html" target="_blank"&gt;Anthropic admitted&lt;/a&gt; that its AI programming tool, Claude Code, had been used as part of a cyberattack targeting 30 organizations, the first time malicious AI exploitation has been discovered on this scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, university researchers in the US reported this week that the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09882" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Artemis AI research platform outperformed nine out of ten penetration testers&lt;/a&gt; at finding security vulnerabilities. As the team pointed out, it did this at a fraction of the cost of a human researcher, potentially expanding access to such capabilities beyond well-resourced criminals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Balancing this is the possibility that defenders could use AI to find the same vulnerabilities. OpenAI’s blog alludes to this capability when it mentions testing its models against the &lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/red-teaming-network/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Red Teaming Network&lt;/a&gt; it announced two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reaction of industry experts to OpenAI’s latest announcement has been mixed. A recurring worry is the inherent difficulty of stopping malicious use of leading models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“OpenAI is asking models to constrain their own capabilities through refusal training, which can be compared to asking a lock to decide when it should open,” commented &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessewilliams1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Williams&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and COO of AI agent DevOps company, Jozu. In effect, the model, not its human authors, defines what is harmful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The distinction is intent and authorization, which models cannot infer from prompts. Jailbreaks consistently defeat refusal training, and sophisticated adversaries will probe detection boundaries and route around them. Safeguards reduce casual misuse, but won’t stop determined threats,” said Williams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“OpenAI’s ‘trusted access program’ sounds reasonable until you examine implementation. Who qualifies as trusted? University researchers? Defense contractors? Foreign SOC analysts?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with guardrails, AI safety can’t be guaranteed, &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/rob-lee" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rob Lee&lt;/a&gt;, chief AI officer at the SANS Institute, observed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Last month, Anthropic disclosed that attackers used Claude Code, a public model with guardrails, to execute 80-90% of a state-sponsored cyberattack autonomously. They bypassed the safety controls by breaking tasks into innocent-looking requests and claiming to be a legitimate security firm. The AI wrote exploit code, harvested credentials, and exfiltrated data while humans basically supervised from the couch,” he pointed out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s the model with guardrails. But if you’re [a villain] and you want your AI Minions to be as evil as possible, you just spin up your own unguardrailed model,” he said. “[There are] plenty of open-weight options out there with no ethics training, no safety controls, and nobody watching. Evil will use evil. … OpenAI’s safety frameworks only constrain the people who weren’t going to attack you anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all experts are this pessimistic. According to &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/allan-liska" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Allan Liska&lt;/a&gt;, threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, it is important not to exaggerate the threat posed by AI. “While we have reported an uptick in interest and capabilities of both nation-state and cybercriminal threat actors when it comes to AI usage, these threats do not exceed the ability of organizations following best security practices,” said Liska.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That may change in the future, however, at this moment it is more important than ever to understand the difference between hype and reality when it comes to AI and other threats.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this story contained comments incorrectly attributed to Rob Lee, which have been replaced with the correct remarks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>How to simplify enterprise cybersecurity through effective identity management</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4104438/how-to-simplify-enterprise-cybersecurity-through-effective-identity-management.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identifying and securing ownership of assets can be a challenging task. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563753/two-factor-authentication-2fa-explained.html"&gt;multifactor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, conditional and privileged access can help organizations to batten down the hatches. But introducing AI technologies often adds a nightmare of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It [using AI technologies] has been a huge challenge for organizations because policy management, compliance management and security touch on every single application and every single system,” Naresh Persaud, US cyber digital identity and cyber AI blueprint leader for Deloitte says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deloittes-industrial-and-financial-customers-save-time-with-the-consultancys-identity-product"&gt;Deloitte’s industrial and financial customers save time with the consultancy’s identity product&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, Deloitte worked with a large industrial customer after identifying that account ownership was sometimes unclear in their existing system. When an endpoint event was identified, it was difficult to trace who owned the targeted account and whether it existed under multiple names.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With identity management systems, we can link the named user of that account and at the same time we can identify whether the account was vaulted in an identity in the privileged access management system,” Persaud explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system also identifies any other accounts associated with a user so they too can be examined for any evidence of intrusion. Persaud refers to this as the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I compromise a privileged account, I might be able to use that account to reset the password for other accounts,” he says. “Immediately identifying the blast radius, determining an appropriate response and putting that information into the alert — that gives the analyst in the security operation center much better telemetry than they had before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system helped connect pieces of the puzzle that might otherwise have to be done manually. The security analyst who flagged the issue would have needed to contact an identity system administrator — an inefficient process in even the most well-oiled operation. Identifying those points of contact and automating the communication process made for a much more efficient response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time is often consumed by attempting to map the data related to an incident to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework, for example. Industry analysis suggests this can take up to 30 minutes. “With AI enablement an analyst can drastically reduce this time up to 70-80%,” Persaud says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Persaud claims that the Deloitte solution was able to simplify the documentation. It created a dashboard that identified related accounts that were not vaulted and allowed for closer review of privileged accounts. Unvaulted accounts could be vaulted in short order and any vulnerabilities in privileged accounts could be pinpointed and addressed. This provided a higher level of precision to the way the customer does security now compared to before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deloitte also worked with a financial services client that had a similar visibility issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is challenging for a lot of organizations to get a complete picture of what their assets are and what controls apply to those assets,” Persaud says. He explains that Deloitte’s identity solution assisted the customer in connecting users with the assets they utilized. As they discovered these assets, they were able to fine-tune the security controls that were applied to each in a more refined fashion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the system is going to [process] financial data and other private information, we need to put the right controls in place on the identity side,” he says. “We’ve been able to bring those two pieces together by correlating discovery of assets with discovery of identity and lining that up with controls from the IT asset management system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the users were able to more quickly integrate applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-apexanalytix-uses-microsoft-azure-to-manage-identity-security"&gt;How apexanalytix uses Microsoft Azure to manage identity security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identity protection is one of the critical controls for any organization in terms of protecting digital assets,” Vishal Grover, CIO of supply chain management platform provider apexanalytix says. “But it is important to maintain the balance between restriction and business requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apexanalytics has used Microsoft products, such as Defender, for more than a decade. “Initially, we were primarily using it for antivirus. Then advanced threat protection came into the picture. Then identity protection. We kept adding more controls and more validations to strengthen the entire security posture,” he tells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has been particularly concerned about the increased &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/518296/what-is-iam-identity-and-access-management-explained.html"&gt;identity risk&lt;/a&gt; as it expands its international footprint — notably opening offices in Hong Kong in 2016 and Saudi Arabia in 2024. As the offices interact and employees travel to other locations, it is crucial that any access to its systems is verified as legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their security team has deployed Azure Active Directory (AAD) to verify geographical boundaries — the locations from which employees might reasonably be expected to access their systems from. For example, if an employee based in the US who rarely travels attempts to log in from a remote location where they are unlikely to be, a red flag is immediately raised. Unless the user’s physical presence in that location can be verified, their credentials have likely been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From a user perspective, anytime someone is traveling outside of their base location, they need to reach out to the IT and security teams to list their specific location,” Grover notes. The adoption of these policies requires reasonable adjustments to user behavior and company policy. But the rewards are substantial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you think from a broader risk management perspective, this has been fundamental to our security model,” he says. The ability to simply track the locations of employees and assign risk accordingly is a significant advancement in risk monitoring for a company growing its international presence. The company looks out for instances of impossible travel, such as if an employee has entered the system in one location and then in another at a distant location that they could not have possibly reached during a specified period, an alert is raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security analysts also use the software to scan for risky sign-ins. If a user logs in from an IP that has been blacklisted, an alert is raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have increasingly relied on conditional access policies that rely on monitoring user behavior. If a user typically spends an average amount of time on certain applications and then radically changes their behavior the activity is flagged and investigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company continues to evaluate its policies at least quarterly in order to ensure that they accord with its evolving business strategies. Grover feels confident that Azure’s capabilities are up to the task but remains vigilant to new potential vulnerabilities that will need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Microsoft flips security script: ‘In scope by default’ makes all vulnerabilities fair game for bug bounties</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105950/microsoft-flips-security-script-in-scope-by-default-makes-all-vulnerabilities-fair-game-for-bug-bounties.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s AI-enabled attackers are agnostic: They’re not limiting themselves to specific companies, products, or services — they’re going where the vulnerabilities are. To meet them on this ground, Microsoft is pivoting its cybersecurity strategy to what it calls ‘In Scope by Default.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, any “critical vulnerability” with a “demonstrable impact” on Microsoft’s online services is eligible for a bounty award. This applies to code owned and managed by Microsoft, as well as to anything delivered by a third party or via open-source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors “don’t care who owns the code they try to exploit,” Tom Gallagher, VP of engineering at the Microsoft Security Response Center, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/12/in-scope-by-default" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the new security policy. “The same approach should apply to the security community who continue to partner with us to provide critical insights that help protect our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="goal-to-incentivize-research"&gt;Goal to ‘incentivize research’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘In Scope by Default’ was announced at Black Hat Europe on Friday, with Gallagher saying that Microsoft “will do whatever it takes” to remediate surfaced issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This strategic shift comes as attackers continuously up their game, aided by AI tools. Microsoft was recently impacted by a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025691/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-breach-hits-on-prem-servers.html" target="_blank"&gt;zero-day vulnerability in SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; that trickled down to businesses and government agencies alike, and in October, the company’s own security update triggered &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076016/security-patch-or-self-inflicted-ddos-microsoft-update-knocks-out-key-enterprise-functions-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;a range of failures&lt;/a&gt;. And just today, to plug the gap until Microsoft can develop its own fix, &lt;a href="https://blog.0patch.com/2025/12/free-micropatches-for-windows-remote.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free unofficial patches&lt;/a&gt; were made available by a third party for a newly-discovered Windows zero-day vulnerability that gives attackers the ability to crash the Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has employed a range of tactics to combat these threats. Gallagher pointed out that, in 2024, the company awarded more than $17 million through its bug bounty program and live hacking events, and its strategy pivot will expand award eligibility. Rather than only being offered for bugs in defined scopes, issues with all online services will be included by default, and as soon as the services are released.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to incentivize research on the highest risk areas, especially the areas that threat actors are most likely to exploit,” said Gallagher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eligibility will now include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft-owned domains and cloud services. Security researchers without Microsoft insider perspective will be encouraged to target its infrastructures via agreed upon rules of engagement.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Third-party code, including open source. In cases where no bug bounty exists in this area, Microsoft will now offer one. Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party code can help raise the bar for “everyone who relies on this code,” Gallagher noted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift is “quite significant,” particularly for a company of Microsoft’s size, noted &lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/erik-avakian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group. The new default inclusion policy is backed by process and governance, and is being applied across the tech giant’s “massive, heterogeneous ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft is explicitly pulling third-party and open-source dependencies into scope when they impact Microsoft services, which reflects how real attacks actually traverse shared infrastructure rather than clean product boundaries,” said Avakian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are welcome to &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;submit their findings&lt;/a&gt; for assessment and for coordinated disclosure, the practice of privately reporting vulnerabilities to vendors so that they can diagnose and fix issues before they are announced publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and its partners follow the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rules of Engagement for Responsible Security Research&lt;/a&gt;, Gallagher noted, which encourages a variety of red teaming activities, such as performing vulnerability assessments on Azure virtual machines (VMs), testing surge capacity, attempting to break out of system boundaries and shared service containers, testing security monitoring and detection systems, and evaluating conditional access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these rules of engagement prohibit red teamers from using or accessing credentials that aren’t their own, launching phishing attacks against Microsoft employees, performing denial-of-service testing or other testing that generates excessive traffic, or interacting with storage accounts not included in a user’s own subscription.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-and-cons-to-the-approach"&gt;Pros and cons to the approach&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This widening of scope isn’t necessarily new, noted Info-Tech’s Avakian, though cloud service providers (CSPs), financial institutions, and SaaS companies publish narrower scope language and handle many cases through back-channel negotiation. But much of this still relies heavily on researcher goodwill and internal judgment calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s wider scope is a bit different, and could result in fewer gray-area arguments and the “is this in scope?” back-and-forth questioning that can expend time and create friction with researchers, said Avakian. It also provides better signaling: If people don’t fear disqualification, they’re more likely to submit early-stage findings. This is great for defenders and can foster stronger trust in the research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It helps send a clear message: ‘We want to hear about problems,’ and internally, it forces ownership,” said Avakian. “Once something’s in scope by default, it helps to force maturity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this could get difficult when it comes to volume, potentially leading to more low-quality reports and speculative or “nebulous” findings, he said. Engineering teams can burn out quickly if everything is treated as urgent, or if severity isn’t well-communicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But this model can work if severity discipline is rock solid,” said Avakian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, attackers could benefit indirectly if defender teams become overloaded, where potential noise could drown out real signals, and fix velocity could slow due to triage backlogs. “In other words, operational drag could very well become the attacker’s friend,” said Avakian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers, for their part, might go down unconventional attack path rabbit holes, and less ethical hackers may spray “low-effort findings” at scale and use ambiguity to pressure for bounty money or even publicly frame rejections as Microsoft ignoring security, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, “scope is really a governance decision,” said Avakian, pointing out that enterprises fall behind when vulnerability programs are still written primarily to reduce payouts, minimize exposure, and protect brand optics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft is signaling that operational clarity beats defensive ambiguity,” said Avakian. However, “in scope by default” only works with maturity behind it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t already have strong governance, triage processes, consistent severity models, and engineering accountability, it becomes problematic,” he said. “Automation, enrichment, and experienced human judgment matter more than ever here, and Microsoft appears to be clearly investing in that long game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
