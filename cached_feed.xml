      <title>Vaillant CISO: NIS2 complexity and lack of clarity endanger its mission</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101952/vaillant-ciso-start-instead-of-waiting.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSO Germany: The energy sector is increasingly becoming a target for cybercriminals. Experts and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) believe that protection in this area must be significantly increased. How do you assess the current situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; The geopolitical tensions we are currently witnessing are leading to an increased threat level. This naturally also affects the heating industry, in which Vaillant operates and which fulfills everyone’s basic need for warmth and hot water at home. Such sectors absolutely must be better protected. The problem is that the attacks are becoming increasingly targeted and complex. These days, we’re no longer dealing with less experienced script kiddies working in their basements, but rather with well-organized and professional cybercriminals. Their goal is to harm the company or the economy of the respective country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence within companies has lowered the barrier to entry for attacks on businesses and supply chains than ever before. This makes it easier, for example, to create targeted phishing emails or develop malware, which previously required significantly more effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you reacting to the changed situation? How are you currently protecting your company from cyberattacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; We pursue a holistic approach to information security. This means we examine every aspect from top to bottom and rely on a multilayered security concept. This includes both preventative and reactive security measures to enable us to react quickly and effectively in an emergency. We are aware, however, that no company can guarantee absolute security. Therefore, everyone should plan with the assumption that a successful attack is always possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We prioritize the security of not only our internal IT infrastructure, but also our global production and products for our customers. Protecting our end customers and adhering to high security standards are our top priorities — especially given the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Our focus is on proactively minimizing risks and ensuring long-term trust in our solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the employees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; Cybersecurity begins with people. Thanks to Vaillant’s global network, we clearly focus on this when it comes to security. Through our holistic four-pillar approach, we rely on comprehensive awareness training for our entire workforce, from gamification approaches to practical compliance training. We also address topics from the private sphere, such as phishing examples from some telecommunications companies or parcel delivery services, to increase relevance and promote sustainable learning processes&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges are currently causing the most problems for CISOs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; First of all, the role of the CISO has fundamentally changed in recent years. Previously, the focus was primarily on technical aspects and operational security. Today, strategic alignment and leadership skills are key qualifications. A modern CISO must not only manage technological risks but also act as a sparring partner for management, assess business risks, and embed information security as an integral part of the corporate strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the biggest challenges currently lie in implementing new legal requirements such as NIS2, DORA, and the Cyber ​​Resilience Act. I describe the whole thing as a regulatory jungle that first needs to be understood. We are operating in a complex regulatory environment that must be interpreted pragmatically and implemented with the right resources. Ultimately, it’s not just about ensuring compliance, but about increasing the security level throughout the entire company to create greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we have too many safety rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; In the heating industry, the regulatory requirements are manageable, even though NIS2 and others are relevant. I generally welcome uniform standards, as they increase safety in Germany and Europe. The challenge lies in national implementation: Each country interprets the regulations differently, which creates considerable complexity for internationally operating companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislators behind NIS2 have failed to develop uniform and pragmatic security rules for implementation across Europe. While NIS2 was adopted at the EU level, it must be transposed into the local legislation of each country. This means that each country contributes its own interpretation. Organizations operating across Europe must therefore consider all relevant legislation in their respective regions. Ensuring a standardized procedure in this context adds further complexity and requires significant coordination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are so many companies still struggling with implementation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; Often, the interpretation of the regulations lacks clarity. Many companies — especially SMEs — don’t know if they even fall within their scope. Added to this are questions about resource allocation: Should implementation be done internally or with external partners? Who assumes responsibility — IT, the compliance department, or a dedicated security team? Furthermore, there is often a lack of maturity and awareness regarding where and how cybersecurity needs to be strategically embedded so that such topics can be implemented appropriately. These factors hamper progress and cost companies crucial time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to regulations. I recommend that companies analyze their current situation, define initial steps, and get started. My motto is: Start, don’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Offensive security takes center stage in the AI era</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101929/offensive-security-takes-center-stage-in-the-ai-era.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-madden-344a665/"&gt;Sara Madden&lt;/a&gt; is looking to take a more offensive approach to safeguarding her company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Convera CISO wants to add a red team to stress test the financial services company’s systems and identify where defenses should be bolstered. She also wants to incorporate &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/652476/4-steps-for-purple-team-success.html"&gt;purple teaming&lt;/a&gt;, where red and blue teams collaborate to improve overall security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think offensive security is a place we need to get to, because [we] can use the information obtained from it to fine-tune the security program and controls,” Madden says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madden is not alone in her desire to add an offensive program to advance her cybersecurity strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise security’s remit is defensive in nature: to protect and defend the company’s systems, data, reputation, customers, and employees. But CISOs like Madden have been increasingly adding offensive components to their strategies, seeing attack simulations as a way to gain valuable information about their technology environments, defense postures, and the weaknesses hackers would find if they attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a growing percentage of CISOs see offensive security as a must-have and, as such, are building up offensive capabilities and integrating them into their security processes to ensure the information revealed during offensive exercises leads to improvements in their overall security posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s super important to have time and resources dedicated to [using] threat intelligence and conducting tabletop exercises and getting to the point where you have purple teaming,” Madden says, “because you don’t want to always be on your heels.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="components-of-offensive-security"&gt;Components of offensive security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offensive security, or OffSec for short, is the practice of using attacker-style tactics to find and fix vulnerabilities in an organization’s own IT environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/dan-mellen"&gt;Dan Mellen&lt;/a&gt;, global and US cyber CTO at professional services firm EY, defines it as the organization’s “identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities before adversaries do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mellen sees several buckets of activities involved in offensive security, starting with vulnerability management at the bottom end of the maturity scale, and then moving up to attack service management and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571697/penetration-testing-explained-how-ethical-hackers-simulate-attacks.html"&gt;penetration testing&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/569703/threat-hunting-explained-taking-an-active-approach-to-defense.html"&gt;threat hunting&lt;/a&gt; and adversarial simulations, such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s the concept of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4083612/the-soc-parachute-needs-more-than-packing-it-needs-practice.html"&gt;purple teaming&lt;/a&gt; where the organization looks at an attack scenario and what were the defenses that should have alerted but didn’t and how to rectify those,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other offensive security components include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red teaming&lt;/strong&gt;, where ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks to test detection and response capabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618336/top-tips-for-cisos-running-red-teams.html"&gt;Red teams aim to emulate threat actors&lt;/a&gt; by using stealthy tactics to bypass controls and achieve objectives such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversary emulation&lt;/strong&gt;, where security pros re-create known threat actor &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3497597/5-best-practices-for-running-a-successful-threat-informed-defense-in-cybersecurity.html"&gt;tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)&lt;/a&gt; based on threat intelligence to validate defensive tools and train incident response teams under real-world conditions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social engineering assessments&lt;/strong&gt;, which test humans and processes through phishing, pretexting, and other manipulation techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It’s similar to the way pen testing tests technology systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security tool evasion testing&lt;/strong&gt;, which tests how well an organization’s security technologies detect and block evasive techniques such as obfuscation, encryption, or living-off-the-land tactics, and tests whether those security technologies can be bypassed via malicious techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these offensive security components — namely vulnerability management, pen testing, and phishing — have been longstanding elements of most enterprise security programs. For example, 88% of security leaders consider pen testing to be a “vital component of their organization’s overall security efforts,” according to the &lt;a href="https://resource.cobalt.io/ciso-perspectives-report"&gt;2025 CISO Perspectives Report&lt;/a&gt; from cybersecurity software maker Cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many CISOs also have had team members with specific offensive security skills for many years. In fact, the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), the Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP), and the Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) certifications from &lt;a href="https://www.offsec.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OffSec&lt;/a&gt; are all credentials that have been in demand for years. Of late, the field of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3957786/top-16-offsec-pen-testing-and-ethical-hacking-certifications.html"&gt;OffSec, pen testing, and ethical hacking certifications&lt;/a&gt; has grown considerably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offensive security technologies are not new, either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, experts say advancements in vendor products thanks to the addition of automation, analytics, and artificial intelligence have increased the effectiveness of offensive security programs while also lowering the barrier of entry for security teams to add OffSec to their operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot of tech providers bring capabilities to market to support this proactive, or offensive, approach,” Mellen says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-to-offsec-operations"&gt;Challenges to OffSec operations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, many security departments have yet to adopt a comprehensive offensive security program — with small and midsize companies being the most likely to have little to no OffSec elements, Mellen says, adding that limited resources — budget, staff, skills — create a common barrier to implementing or maturing offensive security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another factor that keeps CISOs from incorporating more offensive security into their strategies is concern about exposing vulnerabilities they don’t have the ability to address, Mellen adds. “They can’t unknow that they have those vulnerabilities if they’re not able to do something about them, although the hackers are going to find them whether or not you identify them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, Mellen and others contend that it’s critical for CISOs to implement and expand OffSec measures now as hackers increasingly leverage AI to launch more targeted and more sophisticated attacks at a faster clip. To counteract hackers’ growing capabilities, experts say CISOs must become faster in identifying and closing security gaps — which is exactly what OffSec enables CISOs to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Offensive security is more important than it was before, because threat actors are using AI-enabled tools to develop attacks we haven’t experienced before. Back when hackers were using script kiddies, attacks were fairly predictable,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/acardwell/"&gt;Aimee Cardwell&lt;/a&gt;, CISO in residence at tech company Transcend and former CISO of UnitedHealth Group. “Now hacks are so esoteric, they’re almost hard to understand. And if you’re only relying on scanning, you’re not catching potential vulnerabilities early enough or at all. You need to continuously be looking for them through offensive security.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-business-case-for-offsec"&gt;The business case for OffSec&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mellen says CISOs can use the information gleaned from their offensive security programs to create business cases for additional investments in the security program. “That data-driven evidence can go a long way to quantifying risk and quantifying the effort and cost to remediation,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billdunnion/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Bill Dunnion&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of telecommunications company Mitel, sees a strong case for adopting more offensive security measures in his own organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, offensive security is to think like the bad guys. I have to think, ‘What would I do? How would I get in? Can I find those back doors and windows that have been left open?’ so I can find them and fix them,” he says. “What you don’t know in the world of security can kill you, so what offensive security does for me is that it helps me identify the unknowns. And once I know something is there, I can mitigate it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dunnion already has some OffSec components in his cyber strategy, including vulnerability management, pen testing, and threat hunting, but wants to expand such capabilities. For example, he wants to create a formal threat hunting program rather than doing threat hunting on an ad hoc basis — as his team does now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkarsh121/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Utkarsh Choudhary&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of IT security at Deloitte Canada, is another proponent of adopting more OffSec elements, seeing it as “sending out scouts and testing out walls and fences to see if those controls really work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is more systematic and a continuous approach of validating,” he adds, noting that offensive security has become an essential element because of the increasing complexity of today’s enterprise IT environment and the typical organization’s ever-expanding attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choudhary also points out that many OffSec components, such as pen testing, are required by business partners and clients, and by certain regulations and frameworks such as ISO 270001.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like others, Choudhary says OffSec practices help organizations better understand their risks. “It provides you an empirical assessment and forces honesty in the organization,” he says. “It validates what you’re doing well and what you’re not doing well. It proves to the organization if something isn’t sufficient. It gives you a true proof of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To maximize the value, however, Choudhary and others say organizations must move beyond &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; OffSec components to &lt;em&gt;integrating&lt;/em&gt; their offensive program with their defensive one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Offense doesn’t displace defense; it strengthens what defense has been missing. Offense enhances the defense posture,” Choudhary says. “Offensive security adds a security layer to defense, so it’s not either, or even both, but that they have to work in concert. And that makes the organization more proactive rather than reactive, because it lessens the opportunities for hackers to get in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/166-million-packages-of-fake-and-harmful-toys-taken-eu-markets</link>
      <description>Fake toys are poisoning, deafening and injuring children across Europe, while causing major losses to the EU economy. 26 countries, coordinated by Europol, co-led by France, Spain and Romania, and supported by the EUIPO and OLAF, have once again led initiatives to take down the producers and importers of counterfeit toys. With the global toy market valued at up to EUR 300 billion annually, it also remains the second-most counterfeited industry globally.</description>

      <title>KI schafft neue Sicherheitsrisiken für OT-Netzwerke</title>

					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="AI" class="wp-image-4102420" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2471192567.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sicherheitsbehörden sehen in der vermehrten Nutzung von KI eine Gefahr für die Sicherheit von OT-Systemen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Durch bigjom jom – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495110/ot-sicherheit-im-hinblick-auf-nis2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sicherheit der Betriebstechnik (Operational Technology – OT)&lt;/a&gt; in kritischen Infrastrukturen ist seit Jahren ein immer wiederkehrendes Thema. Nach Ansicht von Sicherheitsorganisationen könnte die vermehrte Nutzung von KI in der OT die Lage noch verschlimmern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die US-Cybersicherheitsbehörde CISA hat deshalb vor kurzem gemeinsam mit internationalen Partnerbehörden Handlungsempfehlungen zur sicheren Integration künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in Operational Technology(OT) kritischer Infrastrukturen (&lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/03/2003834257/-1/-1/0/JOINT_GUIDANCE_PRINCIPLES_FOR_THE_SECURE_INTEGRATION_OF_AI_IN_OT.PDF" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) herausgegeben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Da der Einsatz von KI in kritischen OT-Infrastrukturen noch in den Kinderschuhen steckt, lesen sich die Leitlinien wie ein Versuch, Missbrauch und Fehlanwendungen zuvorzukommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im OT-Bereich wird KI derzeit primär in den Sektoren Energie, Wasseraufbereitung, Gesundheitswesen und Fertigung eingesetzt. Der Grund ist der gleiche wie an anderen Stellen: Um Prozesse zu optimieren sowie automatisieren und damit Effizienz und Verfügbarkeit zu verbessern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicherheitsbehörden befürchten, dass Unternehmen sich auf eine neue und noch nicht ausgereifte Technologie einlassen, ohne deren Grenzen zu bewerten, ähnlich wie es in der IT geschehen ist. Unter Berücksichtigung der Risiken für industrielle Steuerungssysteme (Industrial Control Systems – ICS) gemäß der &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Enterprise_Reference_Architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Purdue-Modellhierarchie&lt;/a&gt; werden in den Leitlinien Bedenken wie Prompt Injektion, Datenvergiftung und Datenerfassung aufgezählt. Zudem wird auf „KI-Drift” hingewiesen, bei dem Modelle weniger genau werden, wenn neue Daten von den Trainingsdaten abweichen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Autoren befürchten zudem, dass KI möglicherweise nicht die erforderlichen Hinweise liefert, um Fehler zu diagnostizieren. Darüber hinaus sei es schwierig, die Compliance-Anforderungen zu erfüllen, da sich KI rasch weiterentwickelt, so die Behörden. Zusätzlich weist das Paper darauf hin, dass es zu einem De-Skilling-Effekt beim Menschen kommt, verursacht durch eine schleichende Überabhängigkeit von KI. Ebenso könnten KI-Warnmeldungen zu Ablenkung und kognitiver Überlastung bei den Mitarbeitern führen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schließlich lässt die Tendenz von KI-Technologien wie Chatbots und LLMs zu Halluzinationen Zweifel daran aufkommen, ob die Technologie robust genug ist, um in Umgebungen eingesetzt zu werden, in denen Sicherheit oberste Priorität hat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„KI ist möglicherweise nicht zuverlässig genug, um in industriellen Umgebungen eigenständig kritische Entscheidungen zu treffen. Daher sollte KI wie LLM mit ziemlicher Sicherheit nicht für Security-Entscheidungen in OT-Umgebungen verwendet werden“, so die Autoren der Leitlinien.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dies unterstreicht einen wichtigen Unterschied zwischen der Verwendung von KI in einer OT- und einer IT-Umgebung: OT-Netzwerke sind von Natur aus sicherheitskritisch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="schwierigkeiten-bei-der-entflechtung"&gt;Schwierigkeiten bei der Entflechtung&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Die Leitlinien werfen die richtigen Fragen auf: Welche Risiken gehen wir ein, welchen Wert bringt KI wirklich, wer ist für die Aufsicht verantwortlich und wie reagieren wir, wenn die Technologie versagt?“, kommentiert Sam Maesschalck, OT-Ingenieur bei der Cybersicherheits-Schulungsplattform Immersive Labs. „Wir haben bereits gesehen, was passiert, wenn operative Anforderungen das sichere Design übersteigen. Die IT/OT-Konvergenz brachte Effizienz, aber sie legte auch OT-Netzwerke in einer Weise offen, mit der die Branche immer noch zu kämpfen hat.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Maesschalck würde die Einbindung von KI-Systemen in die OT-Infrastruktur scheitern, wenn nicht zuerst bereits bestehende Probleme gelöst werden. Dazu gehören die Unfähigkeit einiger OT-Geräte, die erforderlichen Datenmengen an KI-Plattformen zu liefern, und das Fehlen von Bestandsaufnahmen, die die Vorhersage von Probleminteraktionen erschweren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zu den Empfehlungen der Leitlinien gehört, dass Organisationen die &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide"&gt;Sicherheitsdesign-Grundsätze&lt;/a&gt; der CISA übernehmen und prüfen sollten, ob die interne Entwicklung eines KI-OT-Projekts ihnen langfristig mehr Kontrolle über das KI-Design und die KI-Implementierung verschaffen würde.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Diese Art von Leitlinien ist einflussreich, weil Betreiber nach Klarheit suchen. Durch staatlich unterstützte Grundsätze, auf die sie sich beziehen können, haben Eigentümer und Ingenieure etwas Konkretes, worauf sie sich berufen können, wenn sie sich gegen eine unsichere oder übereilte Einführung wehren. Außerdem wird dadurch die Bedeutung von Aufklärung unterstrichen“, so Maesschalck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Leitlinien folgen auf den &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3545051/make-ot-networks-a-priority-say-nine-national-security-agencies.html" target="_blank"&gt;Bericht der NSA und des ACSC&lt;/a&gt; aus dem letzten Jahr, in dem die Schritte aufgeführt sind, die Unternehmen zur Sicherung der OT in kritischen Infrastrukturen durchführen sollten. In keinem der beiden Dokumente wird jedoch auf die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3856334/zu-wenig-budget-fur-ot-security.html" target="_blank"&gt;anhaltenden Bedenken eingegangen, dass die OT-Sicherheit immer noch nicht das Budget erhält, das sie verdient&lt;/a&gt;. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>When it comes to security resilience, cheaper isn’t always better</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101863/when-it-comes-to-security-resilience-cheaper-isnt-always-better.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A procurement team throws a small party. They’ve shaved millions off the supplier budget. The CFO beams. The board applauds. Six months later, a cyber incident or supply disruption wipes out those savings in days. The champagne glow fades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not fiction. It happens every year in boardrooms that treat procurement as a hunting ground for savings instead of a safeguard for resilience. When cost reduction becomes the primary focus, resilience pays the price, especially in the case of cyber resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You see it everywhere. Organizations optimize procurement to look good on quarterly slides. They negotiate the lowest price, consolidate suppliers and chase global sourcing arbitrage. It works until the unexpected hits. A ransomware attack cripples a vendor. A third-party breach compromises customer data. A geopolitical shock disrupts digital supply chains. Suddenly, losses from a fragile, unprepared ecosystem dwarf the money saved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a board leading finance, risk, procurement or security, the message is blunt: procurement strategies built on short-term savings erode resilience. And in an era where cyberattacks exploit every weakness, that fragility is a bet against your survival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the arc of the problem and what you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-procurement-prioritizes-cost-above-all"&gt;Why procurement prioritizes cost above all&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Procurement follows the incentives you give it. And most incentives point in one direction: cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boards demand quick wins. Shareholders watch quarterly margins. Procurement KPIs focus on negotiated savings, supplier discounts and contract efficiency. It’s a one-dimensional scoreboard. Nobody hands out trophies for resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber resilience rarely appears on procurement dashboards. A vendor offering cheaper cloud storage will beat a competitor with stronger cyber safeguards, simply because the first is cheaper on paper. The boardroom reinforces this blind spot. Quarterly reporting cycles reward immediate savings, not the unseen cost of risk reduction. Shareholders don’t ask if your supplier encrypts backups or patches vulnerabilities. They ask how much you shaved off the IT contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Global sourcing makes it worse. Firms outsource development or data processing to low-cost regions with weaker privacy laws and fragile security oversight. On spreadsheets, it looks brilliant. In practice, it’s like building your house on sand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Procurement also operates with blind spots. A buyer can compare unit costs of servers, but rarely the supplier’s incident response maturity. Without cyber expertise at the table, decisions default to the cheapest bidder. Cost wins. Security loses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is how organizations become penny-wise. And as attacks multiply, it’s also how they become pound-foolish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-hidden-trade-offs-with-resilience"&gt;The hidden trade-offs with resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Savings don’t erase risk. They shift it. What looks efficient today becomes exposed tomorrow. Cyber resilience is often the first casualty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain fragility:&lt;/strong&gt; Cyber threats thrive on concentration. When procurement consolidates digital services into a single provider to save money, a single breach can have a ripple effect across your operations. Consider the numerous businesses tied to a single compromised cloud vendor, which can be cheap until an outage or ransomware campaign brings them all down.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity weakness:&lt;/strong&gt; Vendors are often chosen for cost, not defense-in-depth. The “affordable” software supplier may lack basic monitoring or encryption. When attackers compromise them, your systems become collateral damage. Procurement saved a dollar but opened a door for hackers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational rigidity:&lt;/strong&gt; Cheap IT providers rarely build resilience into contracts. They don’t maintain redundant data centers. They don’t run breach simulations. They don’t guarantee recovery in hours, only in days. When ransomware strikes, you’re paying in downtime what you once saved in cost.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural risks:&lt;/strong&gt; A transactional relationship kills transparency. Vendors under constant price pressure often fail to promptly disclose near-misses. They fear contract termination. That delay costs you valuable hours in containment. Collaboration in crisis requires trust, not just a signed contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Procurement thinks it saved money. What it really bought was fragility disguised as efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="real-world-costs-of-cheap-procurement"&gt;Real-world costs of cheap procurement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The myth of cheap procurement collapses under stress. Recent history offers brutal lessons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SolarWinds breach.&lt;/a&gt; Thousands of organizations relied on a cost-efficient IT supplier. Attackers slipped malicious code into its updates. Hackers compromised governments and corporations worldwide. The procurement team might have saved millions. The damage bill reached billions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/kaseya-ransomware-attack-guidance-affected-msps-and-their-customers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kaseya ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt;. Many mid-sized businesses relied on Kaseya’s remote management tool because it was an affordable option. Attackers hijacked it, spreading ransomware across hundreds of clients. The procurement logic of a single, inexpensive tool became the weapon that attackers scaled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/attack-colonial-pipeline-what-weve-learned-what-weve-done-over-past-two-years" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Colonial Pipeline hack&lt;/a&gt;. A single compromised VPN account, lacking multifactor authentication, triggered the shutdown of critical infrastructure. Procurement had outsourced key systems with minimal cyber scrutiny. The real cost wasn’t the ransom. It was the systemic disruption and reputational fallout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-099a" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 and digital fragility&lt;/a&gt;. Hospitals and governments scrambled to scale remote work with IT services. Many picked low-cost providers. Within months, attackers exploited weak VPNs, unpatched systems and unsecured collaboration tools. The savings turned into a wave of cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/02/semiconductor-chip-shortage-supply-chain/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Automotive chip shortages meet cyber&lt;/a&gt;. As chip suppliers consolidated, ransomware attacks on a single manufacturer cascaded across global production. Procurement’s lean sourcing magnified the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are not outliers. They are the predictable outcome of ignoring cyber resilience in procurement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each case reveals the same truth: the resilience premium far exceeds the savings illusion. Revenue loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage, customer churn; the real bill is always larger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-balance-cost-and-resilience"&gt;How to balance cost and resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not a call to abandon savings. It’s a call to recognize that cost efficiency without cyber resilience is a false economy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your challenge is to redesign procurement so that cost efficiency and cyber resilience reinforce each other, rather than cancelling each other out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="risk-based-procurement"&gt;Risk-based procurement&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treat procurement like risk management, not bargain hunting. Every supplier is a potential doorway into your systems. Locks, alarms and cameras are used to reinforce some doors. Others are left ajar. If you let procurement chase the lowest price without scoring those risks, you’ve just invited attackers to stroll in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Practical steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require cybersecurity due diligence in every RFP. Ask about patching frequency, incident response protocols, SOC 2/ISO 27001 certifications and zero-trust adoption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Classify vendors by risk tier. A stationery supplier doesn’t need the same scrutiny as a cloud services provider.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Apply a minimum cyber baseline. If a vendor cannot meet basic security controls, such as MFA, encryption and vulnerability management, they should not even qualify, regardless of price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is not cost inflation. It’s cost prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-metrics"&gt;Resilience metrics&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you only measure savings, procurement will only deliver savings. Expand the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resilience KPIs could include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean time to detect (MTTD):&lt;/strong&gt; How quickly does a supplier detect incidents?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean time to respond (MTTR):&lt;/strong&gt; How fast do they contain breaches?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recovery time objectives (RTOs):&lt;/strong&gt; How quickly can systems or services be restored?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch management cadence:&lt;/strong&gt; Average time to remediate critical vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure speed:&lt;/strong&gt; How fast does a vendor reports breaches or exposures?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine reporting these alongside contract savings in quarterly board updates. Suddenly, procurement leaders see resilience as part of their job, not a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cross-functional-governance"&gt;Cross-functional governance&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Procurement cannot navigate cyber risk alone. You need CFOs, CROs, CIOs and CISOs at the table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CFO ensures the business case is sound, balancing savings against potential loss exposure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The CRO frames supplier decisions within the context of the enterprise’s risk appetite.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The CIO and CISO ensure digital suppliers meet the organization’s cyber and operational resilience standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without this alignment, procurement decisions drift into cost myopia. With it, they anchor in strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strategic-supplier-partnerships"&gt;Strategic supplier partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relationships, not transactions, build resilience. If you treat suppliers like commodities, they will act like commodities. In a crisis, they’ll give you the bare minimum required by the contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An article in Procurement Magazine argues that &lt;a href="https://procurementmag.com/news/supplier-partnerships-driving-procurement-innovation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;procurement is shifting from transactional interactions toward deep supplier partnerships&lt;/a&gt; that emphasize trust, shared value and resilience. It demonstrates how these relationships enable procurement functions to drive innovation, manage risk and deliver lasting business impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you cultivate long-term partnerships, they’ll invest in joint resilience. They’ll disclose incidents quickly. They’ll share threat intelligence. They’ll prioritize your recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concrete actions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign resilience-focused SLAs covering uptime, response times and breach notification.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Hold quarterly joint security reviews.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Run joint red-team or tabletop exercises.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Establish escalation channels beyond account managers, allowing CISOs and CTOs to communicate directly during crises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Partnerships cost more upfront. But they pay dividends when disruption strikes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="scenario-testing"&gt;Scenario testing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Procurement decisions must survive stress tests. Don’t assume contracts will hold under pressure. Test them. Run simulations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when ransomware hits your cloud provider?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How fast does your SaaS partner notify you of an exposure?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If your outsourced developer leaks data, how quickly can you shut access down?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Can a logistics partner reroute around a cyber disruption at a port?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tests reveal weaknesses early, when you can fix them without incurring significant consequences. They also signal to suppliers that resilience is non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="embedding-cyber-resilience-into-procurement-culture"&gt;Embedding cyber resilience into procurement culture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Changing the mindset is the hard part. Procurement has long treated cost as the hero metric. You need to reset the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrate resilience wins in the same breath as cost savings.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Highlight how a supplier’s strong security posture avoided disruption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Train procurement professionals to understand cyber basics; what MFA, patch cadence or zero trust mean in practice.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Make resilience part of career progression. Reward procurement leaders who achieve sustainable value, not just savings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cultural shift transforms procurement from bargain hunters into resilience builders. And that is how you make resilience sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-payoff"&gt;The payoff&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When procurement weaves in cyber resilience, you don’t just avoid losses; you create an advantage. You recover faster than rivals. You protect customer trust. You maintain operations when others stumble. That is not an extra cost. That is an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resilience is not an extra cost. It’s strategic insurance. It is the reason your savings last instead of evaporating in the next breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Short-term procurement savings look good in board reports. But when cyber incidents strike, those savings often collapse into losses. You don’t want to be the leader explaining how millions saved turned into billions lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is clear: Cost efficiency and resilience are not enemies. They are allies when appropriately governed. Procurement must evolve from cheapest supplier wins to most sustainable partner wins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a leader, your call is clear. Redefine procurement’s mandate. Add cyber resilience to the scoreboard. Demand metrics beyond cost. Stress-test decisions. Elevate procurement from bargain hunter to resilience builder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being penny-wise but pound-foolish is not just careless. It’s existential.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GenAI-Security als Checkliste</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493126/genai-security-als-checkliste.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Das Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) gibt Unternehmen eine Checkliste für (mehr) GenAI-Sicherheit an die Hand." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3376704/1200x.jpg" title="Das Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) gibt Unternehmen eine Checkliste für (mehr) GenAI-Sicherheit an die Hand." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Das Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) gibt Unternehmen eine Checkliste für (mehr) GenAI-Sicherheit an die Hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: Gannvector | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Während Unternehmen wie OpenAI, Anthropic, Google oder Microsoft aber auch Open-Source-Alternativen bei ihren &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492643/generative-aieine-neue-herausforderung-fur-den-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="Generative-AI"&gt;Generative-AI&lt;/a&gt;– und &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2823883/was-sind-llms.html" target="_blank" title="Large-Language-Model"&gt;Large-Language-Model&lt;/a&gt;-Angeboten exponentielle User-Zuwächse verzeichnen, sind IT-Sicherheitsentscheider bemüht, mit der rasanten KI-Entwicklung in ihren Unternehmen Schritt zu halten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Non-Profit-Organisation OWASP trägt dieser Entwicklung mit einer neuen Veröffentlichung Rechnung: der “&lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/llm-applications-cybersecurity-and-governance-checklist-english/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LLM AI Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Governance Checklist&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="llm-bedrohungskategorien"&gt;LLM-Bedrohungskategorien&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Thema KI ist ziemlich umfangreich, weswegen die OWASP-Checkliste vor allem darauf abzielt, Führungskräfte dabei zu unterstützen, die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494359/der-grose-ki-risiko-guide.html" target="_blank" title="wesentlichen Risiken"&gt;wesentlichen Risiken&lt;/a&gt; im Zusammenhang mit generativer KI und großen Sprachmodellen möglichst schnell zu identifizieren und entsprechende Abhilfemaßnahmen einzuleiten. Das soll gewährleisten, dass Unternehmen über die nötigen, grundlegenden Sicherheitskontrollen verfügen, um generative KI und LLM-Tools, -Services und Produkte sicher einzusetzen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dabei betont OWASP, dass die Checkliste keinen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit erhebt und sich mit &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495153/threat-intelligence-mit-gen-ai-5-wege-zur-besseren-bedrohungsabwehr.html" target="_blank" title="zunehmender Reife"&gt;zunehmender Reife&lt;/a&gt; der Technologie und Tools ebenfalls weiterentwickeln wird. Die Sicherheitsexperten ordnen LLM-Bedrohungen in verschiedene Kategorien ein, wie die nachfolgende Abbildung veranschaulicht:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Die OWASP KI-Bedrohungs-Map." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3376705/1200x.jpg" title="Die OWASP KI-Bedrohungs-Map." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Die OWASP KI-Bedrohungs-Map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: OWASP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geht es darum, eine &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491793/genai-und-cloud-risiken-ist-ihre-cloud-security-strategie-bereit-fur-llms.html" target="_blank" title="LLM-Strategie"&gt;LLM-Strategie&lt;/a&gt; festzulegen, müssen Unternehmen vor allem mit den einzigartigen Risiken umgehen, die generative KI und LLMs aufwerfen. Diese müssen durch organisatorische Governance und entsprechende Security-Kontrollen minimiert werden. Im Rahmen ihrer Veröffentlichung empfehlen die OWASP-Experten Unternehmen einen sechsstufigen Ansatz, um eine wirksame LLM-Strategie zu entwickeln:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mit OWASP in sechs Schritten zum LLM-Deployment." src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3376706/1200x.jpg" title="Mit OWASP in sechs Schritten zum LLM-Deployment." width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Mit OWASP in sechs Schritten zum LLM-Deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: OWASP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auch hinsichtlich der Deployment-Typen in Sachen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494507/large-language-models-absichern-die-10-haufigsten-llm-schwachstellen.html" target="_blank" title="LLM"&gt;LLM&lt;/a&gt; empfiehlt OWASP, ganz genau hinzusehen und entsprechende Überlegungen anzustellen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Welche Art von KI-Modell ist für Sie die richtige?" src="https://images.computerwoche.de/bdb/3376707/1200x.jpg" title="Welche Art von KI-Modell ist für Sie die richtige?" width="1200" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="foundryImageCaption"&gt;Welche Art von KI-Modell ist für Sie die richtige?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt; Foto: OWASP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="die-owasp-ki-checkliste"&gt;Die OWASP-KI-Checkliste&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden haben wir die von OWASP veröffentlichte Checkliste etwas “aufgedröselt”. Folgende Bereiche sollten Sie im Rahmen Ihrer Generative-AI- respektive LLM-Initiativen unbedingt prüfen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversarial Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dieser Bereich umfasst sowohl Wettbewerber als auch Angreifer und konzentriert sich nicht nur auf die Angriffs-, sondern auch auf die Unternehmenslandschaft. In diesen Bereich fällt beispielsweise, zu verstehen, wie die Konkurrenz KI einsetzt, um bessere Geschäftsergebnisse zu erzielen und die internen Prozesse und Richtlinien (beispielsweise &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492511/extended-detection-and-response-losungendie-11-besten-xdr-tools.html" target="_blank" title="Incident-Response-Pläne"&gt;Incident-Response-Pläne&lt;/a&gt;) zu aktualisieren, um für Cyberangriffe und Sicherheitsvorfälle im Zusammenhang mit generativer KI gewappnet zu sein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat Modeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Bedrohungsmodellierung gewinnt im Zuge des von zahlreichen Security-Institutionen propagierten “Secure-by-Design”-Ansatzes zunehmend an Bedeutung. In diesen Bereich fallen etwa die Überlegungen, wie Angreifer LLMs und generative KI &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495991/google-prognose-2024-genai-verstarkt-phishing-kampagnen.html" target="_blank" title="für schnellere Exploits nutzen können"&gt;für schnellere Exploits nutzen können&lt;/a&gt;, wie Unternehmen schadhafte KI-Nutzung erkennen können und wie sich die Technologie über interne Systeme und Umgebungen absichern lässt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KI-Bestandsaufnahme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Man kann nichts schützen, von dessen Existenz man nichts weiß” greift auch in der Generative-AI-Welt. Im Bereich der KI-Bestandsaufnahme geht es darum, Assets für intern entwickelte Lösungen und externe Tools und Plattformen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496117/exploit-gefahr-gehackt-wegen-geloschter-cloud-assets.html" target="_blank" title="zu erfassen"&gt;zu erfassen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dabei ist nicht nur wichtig, die Tools und Services zu kennen, die genutzt werden, sondern auch über die Verantwortlichkeiten Bescheid zu wissen. OWASP empfiehlt zudem, KI-Komponenten in &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492152/software-bill-of-material-umsetzen-die-8-besten-sbom-tools.html" target="_blank" title="SBOMs"&gt;SBOMs&lt;/a&gt; zu erfassen und Datenquellen nach Sensibilität zu katalogisieren. Darüber hinaus sollte es auch einen Prozess geben, der gewährleistet, dass zukünftige Tools und Services aus dem unternehmerischen Inventar sicher ein- und ausgegliedert werden können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KI-Security- und -Datenschutz-Schulungen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Mensch ist das schwächste Glied in der Sicherheitskette – heißt es oft. Das muss allerdings nicht so sein – vorausgesetzt, Unternehmen integrieren &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492034/security-awareness-trainings-schulungen-richtig-managen.html" target="_blank" title="KI-Sicherheits- und Datenschutztrainings"&gt;KI-Sicherheits- und Datenschutztrainings&lt;/a&gt; in ihre GenAI-Journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das beinhaltet beispielsweise, der Belegschaft ein Verständnis über aktuelle AI- und LLM-Initiativen zu vermitteln – genauso wie zur Technologie an sich und den wesentlichen Problemen im Bereich Security. Darüber hinaus ist in diesem Bereich eine Kultur unabdingbar, die von Trust und Transparenz geprägt ist. Das ist auch ein ganz wesentlicher Punkt, um “&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2832096/so-schuetzen-sie-sich-vor-schatten-ki.html" target="_blank" title="Schatten-KI"&gt;Schatten-KI&lt;/a&gt;” zu verhindern. Anderenfalls werden Plattformen heimlich genutzt und die Security untergraben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Cases für KI etablieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ganz ähnlich wie zuvor bei der Cloud erstellen die meisten Unternehmen keine kohärenten, strategischen Geschäftsmodelle für den Einsatz neuer Technologien – auch nicht, wenn es um generative KI und LLMs geht. Sich von &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2815709/die-6-groessten-it-hypes.html" target="_blank" title="Hype und FOMO"&gt;Hype und FOMO&lt;/a&gt; anstecken zu lassen, ist relativ schnell geschehen – ohne soliden Business Case riskieren Unternehmen aber nicht nur, schlechte Ergebnisse zu erzielen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ohne &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2833069/wie-governance-im-ki-zeitalter-geht.html" target="_blank" title="Governance"&gt;Governance&lt;/a&gt; ist es nahezu unmöglich, Rechenschaftspflicht und klare Zielsetzungen zu realisieren. In diesen Bereich der OWASP-Checkliste fällt beispielsweise, ein &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACI" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="RACI"&gt;RACI&lt;/a&gt;-Diagramm zu erstellen, dass die KI-Initiativen eines Unternehmens dokumentiert, Verantwortlichkeiten zuweist und unternehmensweite Richtlinien und Prozesse etabliert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rechtliches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die rechtlichen Auswirkungen von KI sollten keinesfalls unterschätzt werden – sie entwickeln sich rasant weiter und können Reputation und finanziellem Gefüge potenziell beträchtliche Schäden zufügen. In diesen Bereich können diverse Aspekte fallen – zum Beispiel:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produktgarantien im Zusammenhang mit KI,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KI-EULAs oder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intellectual-Property-Risiken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kurzum: Ziehen Sie Ihr Legal-Team oder entsprechende Experten hinzu, um die verschiedenen rechtsbezogenen Aktivitäten zu identifizieren, die für Ihr Unternehmen relevant sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatorisches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aufbauend auf den juristischen Diskussionen entwickeln sich auch die regulatorischen Vorschriften schnell weiter – ein Beispiel ist der &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491652/ai-act-wie-europas-ki-gesetz-cisos-fordert.html" target="_blank" title="AI Act der EU"&gt;AI Act der EU&lt;/a&gt;. Unternehmen sollten deshalb die für sie geltenden KI-Compliance-Anforderungen ermitteln.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLM-Lösungen nutzen oder implementieren&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Einsatz von LLM-Lösungen erfordert spezifische Risiko- und Kontrollüberlegungen. Die OWASP-Checkliste nennt in diesem Bereich unter anderem die Aspekte:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access Control &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493543/was-ist-privileged-access-management.html" target="_blank" title="umsetzen"&gt;umsetzen&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KI-Trainings-Pipelines absichern,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daten-Workflows mappen und&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;bestehende oder potenzielle Schwachstellen in LLMs und Lieferketten identifizieren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus sind kontinuierliche Audits durch Dritte, Penetrationstests und auch Code-Reviews für Zulieferer empfehlenswert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing, Evaluierung, Verifizierung, Validierung (TEVV)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der TEVV-Prozess wird vom NIST in seinem &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Framework"&gt;AI Framework&lt;/a&gt; ausdrücklich empfohlen. Dieser beinhaltet:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493611/dynamic-static-application-security-testing-die-besten-dast-sast-tools.html" target="_blank" title="Continuous Testing"&gt;Continuous Testing&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluierungen,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verifizierungen und&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validierungen sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennzahlen zu Funktionalität, Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit von KI-Modellen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Und zwar über den gesamten Lebenszyklus von KI-Modellen hinweg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modell- und Risikokarten&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für den ethischen Einsatz von großen Sprachmodellen sieht die OWASP-Checkliste Modell- und Risiko-“Karten” vor. Diese können den Nutzern Verständnis über KI-Systeme vermitteln und so das Vertrauen in die Systeme stärken. Zudem ermöglichen sie, potenziell negative Begleiterscheinungen wie Bias oder Datenschutzprobleme offen zu thematisieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Karten können Details zu KI-Modellen, Architektur, Trainingsmethoden und Performance-Metriken beinhalten. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2832860/die-wichtigsten-fragen-und-antworten-2.html" target="_blank" title="Responsible AI"&gt;Responsible AI&lt;/a&gt; und allen Fragen in Zusammenhang mit Fairness und Transparenz.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrieval Augmented Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2832846/was-ist-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag.html" target="_blank" title="Retrieval Augmented Generation"&gt;Retrieval Augmented Generation&lt;/a&gt; (RAG) ist eine Möglichkeit, die Fähigkeiten von LLMs zu optimieren, wenn es darum geht, relevante Daten aus bestimmten Quellen abzurufen. Dazu gehört, vortrainierte Modelle zu optimieren und bestehende auf neuen Datensätzen erneut zu trainieren, um ihre Leistung zu optimieren. OWASP empfiehlt, RAG zu implementieren, um den Mehrwert und die Effektivität großer Sprachmodelle im Unternehmenseinsatz zu maximieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KI-Red-Teaming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least empfehlen die OWASP-Experten auch, KI-&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495010/red-vs-blue-vs-purple-teams-so-trainieren-sie-effektiv-den-ernstfall.html" target="_blank" title="Red-Teaming-Sessions"&gt;Red-Teaming-Sessions&lt;/a&gt; abzuhalten. Dabei werden Angriffe auf KI-Systeme simuliert, um Schwachstellen zu identifizieren und existierende Kontroll- und Abwehrmaßnahmen zu validieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OWASP betont dabei, dass Red Teaming für sich alleine keine umfassende Lösung respektive Methode darstellt, um Generative AI und LLMs abzusichern. Vielmehr sollte KI-Red-Teaming in einen umfassenderen Ansatz eingebettet werden. Essenziell ist dabei jedoch laut den Experten insbesondere, dass im Unternehmen Klarheit darüber herrscht, wie die Anforderungen für Red Teaming aussehen sollten. Ansonsten sind Verstöße gegen Richtlinien oder gar juristischer Ärger vorprogrammiert. (fm)&lt;/p&gt;

Dezember 2025 in Kraft getreten. Dieser Beitrag zeigt, wie sich mit DevSecOps ein Großteil der Pflichtarbeit automatisieren lässt.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Vadi Fuoco – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4090107/bundestag-beschliest-nis2-umsetzung.html"&gt;NIS2&lt;/a&gt; ist symbolisch für das Kernproblem europäischer Richtlinien und Verordnungen: Sie erzeugen unnötigen Papierkrieg und entfalten ihre Wirkung zu selten. Sei es das Lieferkettengesetz, die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4088083/eu-kommission-will-dsgvo-fur-ki-und-cookie-tracking-lockern.html"&gt;DSGVO&lt;/a&gt;‑Folgenabschätzungen oder das IT‑Sicherheitsgesetz – sie haben gemeinsam, dass Unternehmen gigantische Dokumentationsberge produzieren müssen. Diese erhöhen weder die tatsächliche Sicherheit, noch sind sie realistisch prüfbar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compliant ist in der Regel derjenige, der eine umfangreiche Dokumentation aller Prozesse und regelmäßigen Prüfungen vorlegen kann. Diese sind zumeist so ausführlich, dass ihre Erstellung bereits nahezu unzumutbare Aufwände verursacht und ihre manuelle Prüfung praktisch unmöglich wird. Selbst wenn man sie prüfen würde, wären die Informationen nicht präzise genug, um echte Sicherheit zu belegen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sicherheit-gehort-in-die-planung"&gt;Sicherheit gehört in die Planung&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In vielen Unternehmen entsteht dadurch eine absurde Praxis: Das technische Team baut funktionierende Infrastruktur und losgelöst davon schreibt ein Compliance‑Beauftragter im Nachhinein eine seitenlange Rechtfertigung, warum die Lösung angeblich sicher sei.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist ungefähr so, als würde Volkswagen ein Auto bauen und erst danach verfasst jemand 40 Seiten darüber, warum dieses Auto den Sicherheitsstandards entsprechen sollte. In der realen Industrie läuft es natürlich anders: Sicherheitsanforderungen fließen bereits in die Planung ein, technologische Mindeststandards sind definiert, und Qualitätsprozesse überwachen die Umsetzung automatisch. Compliance ergibt sich aus Technik – nicht aus Leitz‑Ordnern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In anderen Bereichen, wie der Steuerprüfung, hat man dieses Problem längst erkannt und die Automatisierung relevanter Prozesse gesetzlich vorgeschrieben (Stichwort: elektronische Registrierkasse, revisionssichere Buchhaltungssoftware). Das erspart ehrlichen Unternehmern nicht nur enorme manuelle Arbeit, sondern reduziert vor allem das Missbrauchsrisiko.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leider werden in Deutschland nur wenige Dinge so konsequent umgesetzt wie das Eintreiben unserer Steuern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anders als beim Thema Steuerlast sollten Unternehmen jedoch ein intrinsisches Interesse daran haben, ihre IT‑Sicherheit korrekt zu implementieren. Das Bußgeld für einen NIS2‑Verstoß kann bis zu zehn Millionen Euro oder zwei Prozent des weltweiten Jahresumsatzes betragen. Die wirtschaftlichen Schäden erfolgreicher Cyberangriffe sind oft existenzbedrohend und summieren sich bereits heute auf dreistellige Milliardenbeträge pro Jahr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch wenn es nicht ausdrücklich gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist, gibt es mittlerweile – nicht zuletzt durch AI‑gestützte Werkzeuge – die Möglichkeit, Sicherheitsprozesse und ihre vollständige Dokumentation so weit zu automatisieren, dass sich Security, Compliance und Auditierbarkeit in einem einzigen technischen Prozess vereinen lassen. Das spart nicht nur Ressourcen, sondern erhöht auch die tatsächliche Sicherheit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie dies im Detail aussehen kann, zeigt ein Beispiel einer SaaS‑Applikation in der Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id=""&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-im-wandel-von-textdokumenten-zu-deklarativer-technik"&gt;IT im Wandel: von Textdokumenten zu deklarativer Technik&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 verlangt im Kern drei Dinge: konkrete Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, Prozesse und Richtlinien zur Steuerung dieser Maßnahmen sowie belastbare Nachweise, dass sie im Alltag funktionieren. Die Prozessdokumentation – also Policies, Zuständigkeiten und Abläufe – ist für die meisten größeren Unternehmen nichts grundsätzlich Neues. &lt;a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/Standards-und-Zertifizierung/Zertifizierung-und-Anerkennung/Zertifizierung-von-Managementsystemen/ISO-27001-Basis-IT-Grundschutz/iso-27001-basis-it-grundschutz_node.html"&gt;ISO‑27001&lt;/a&gt;‑basierte Informationssicherheits-Managementsysteme (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495826/iso-und-isms-darum-gehen-security-zertifizierungen-schief.html"&gt;ISMS&lt;/a&gt;), HR‑Prozesse und Management‑Handbücher existieren oft seit Jahren. Entscheidend für NIS2 sind deshalb vor allem zwei Ebenen: die technischen Maßnahmen und die Evidenz, dass sie wirksam sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genau hier zeigt sich der Umbruch der letzten Jahre. Früher wurden Konzepte, Maßnahmen und Spezifikationen von Software‑ und IT‑Infrastrukturen überwiegend in Textform dokumentiert. Programmcode war zu komplex, Konfigurationen lagen verstreut in Dateien, Ticketsystemen oder im Kopf einzelner Administratoren. Im Nachgang hat man Dokumente geschrieben – häufig durch fachfremde Kollegen. Dieses Vorgehen war vor allem aus zwei Gründen problematisch: Es skaliert nicht in wachsenden, verteilten Umgebungen, und es passt nicht zu dem Ziel, technische Prozesse konsequent zu automatisieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In modernen Systemen setzt man deshalb auf Verfahren wie Test‑ oder Behaviour‑driven Development und Infrastructure as Code (IaC), die – konsequent angewendet – textuelle Dokumentation weitgehend ersetzen. Die von NIS2 geforderten technischen Spezifikationen können direkt auf diese Artefakte referenzieren: IaC‑Definitionen legen Verschlüsselung, Netzsegmente oder Backup‑Szenarien fest, und CI/CD‑Pipelines spielen sie revisionssicher in die Produktion aus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Änderungen sind damit nicht nur technisch exakt beschrieben, sondern über Commits und Deployments auch zeitlich nachvollziehbar. Die Evidenz für Aspekte, die sich nicht vollständig deklarativ fassen lassen – etwa die Sicherheit der Software‑Supply‑Chain oder des Anwendungscodes – kann über Security‑Checks in der CI/CD‑Pipeline und eine laufende Bewertung durch SIEM‑ und CNAPP‑Systeme abgebildet werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie das konkret aussehen kann, zeigt sich besonders deutlich in folgenden Bereichen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity &amp;amp; Access Management,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Schwachstellenmanagement in der Software‑Supply‑Chain sowie im Monitoring,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Incident Handling&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;und Meldepflichten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id=""&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identity-access-management-policies-as-code-statt-rollen%e2%80%91excel"&gt;Identity &amp;amp; Access Management: Policies as Code statt Rollen‑Excel&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identity &amp;amp; Access Management ist eine der zentralen Säulen von NIS2. Gefordert sind nicht nur „irgendwelche“ Rollen, sondern ein Zugriffskonzept nach Need‑to‑know, Least Privilege und Separation of Duties. In der Praxis lässt sich das gut in drei Ebenen denken: bewusste Vergabe von Rechten, ein realistischer Lebenszyklus dieser Rechte – und eine Architektur, die Lateral Movement so weit wie möglich verhindert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statt Berechtigungen in Excel, Admin‑UIs und verstreuten Wikis zu pflegen, werden Rollen und Zugriffsrechte als Policies as Code, beziehungsweise Infrastructure as Code definiert – etwa als Terraform‑Module oder JSON/YAML‑Policies in einem Git‑Repository. Alle Änderungen laufen ausschließlich über Merge Requests und werden über eine CI/CD‑Pipeline ausgerollt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Damit ist klar nachvollziehbar, wer welche Rechte geändert hat, wer das freigegeben hat und wann die Änderung produktiv gegangen ist. Die Dokumentations‑ und Nachweispflichten von NIS2 ergeben sich so direkt aus Git‑History und Pipeline‑Logs, ohne dass jemand zusätzliche Word‑Konzepte schreiben muss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Rollenmodell allein ist noch kein Least Privilege. NIS2 verlangt, dass Rechte regelmäßig überprüft und überflüssige Berechtigungen entfernt werden. In Cloud‑Umgebungen mit hunderten Accounts, Services, Pods und Functions ist das manuell kaum noch handhabbar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hier setzen Cloud‑Identity‑Entitlement‑Management‑Systeme (CIEM) an. Sie lesen alle effektiven Berechtigungen aus der Umgebung aus, korrelieren sie mit Audit‑Logs und zeigen, welche Rechte tatsächlich genutzt werden und wo Überprivilegierung besteht. Besonders bei Non‑Human Identities (Service‑Accounts, Workloads) ist das entscheidend, weil genau hier oft sehr breite Rechte vergeben werden, die Angreifern später als Sprungbrett dienen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einige Start-Ups bieten mittlerweile sogar CIEM-Systeme, welche mit Hilfe von AI automatisch IAM-Policies für die entsprechenden Rollen generieren können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id=""&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="schwachstellenmanagement-software%e2%80%91supply%e2%80%91chain-sbom-statt-scanner%e2%80%91pdf"&gt;Schwachstellenmanagement &amp;amp; Software‑Supply‑Chain: SBOM statt Scanner‑PDF&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der zweite Block, den NIS2 und die neue Durchführungsverordnung 2024/2690 für digitale Dienste scharf stellen, ist das Schwachstellenmanagement im eigenen Code und in der Lieferkette. Gefordert sind regelmäßige Vulnerability‑Scans, Verfahren zur Bewertung und Priorisierung, fristgerechte Behandlung kritischer Schwachstellen sowie ein geregeltes Vulnerability‑Handling und – wo nötig – Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure. Für Cloud‑ und SaaS‑Provider kommen Supply‑Chain‑Pflichten hinzu, etwa gegenüber Cloud‑, CI/CD‑ und Registry‑Dienstleistern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im klassischen Schwachstellenmanagement werden SCA‑, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493611/dynamic-static-application-security-testing-die-besten-dast-sast-tools.html"&gt;SAST‑ und DAST&lt;/a&gt;‑Scanner einfach „über alles drüber geworfen“. Das Ergebnis sind endlose Listen an Findings, von denen ein Großteil Fehlalarme oder für das konkrete System nicht relevant ist. Diese Daten landen dann in Excel‑Tabellen oder einer Schwachstellendatenbank, in der Teams versuchen, Prioritäten zu vergeben. Gerade bei Zero‑Day‑Lücken führt das zu hektischen Ad‑hoc‑Analysen: Welche unserer Komponenten sind betroffen? Ist die Schwachstelle in unserer Architektur überhaupt ausnutzbar? Was tun wir, solange es noch keinen Patch gibt?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der moderne Ansatz ist, alle &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493657/security-by-design-devsecops-so-gelingt-sichere-softwareentwicklung.html"&gt;DevSecOps&lt;/a&gt;‑Findings in einem zentralen System zu konsolidieren. Dort fließen Ergebnisse aus SCA, SAST und DAST zusammen, werden mit Kontext aus Software Bill of Materials (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491814/sbom-erklart-was-ist-eine-software-bill-of-materials.html"&gt;SBOMs&lt;/a&gt;), Architektur und Exponiertheit angereichert und mit Hilfe von AI vorgefiltert. False Positives lassen sich so drastisch reduzieren, und übrig bleibt eine deutlich kleinere Menge an tatsächlich relevanten Schwachstellen, inklusive einer Einschätzung, wie kritisch sie im konkreten Setup sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese verdichteten Findings können direkt in Ticketsysteme und ins &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495240/security-operations-services-das-mussen-soc-analysten-uber-ihr-unternehmen-wissen.html"&gt;SOC&lt;/a&gt; weitergegeben werden, wo sie wie Incidents behandelt, nachverfolgt und für NIS2‑Reports ausgewertet werden. Aus einem wuchernden Scanner‑Output wird so ein steuerbarer Prozess, der sowohl die gesetzlichen Anforderungen als auch die Realität im Betrieb abbildet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id=""&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="monitoring-incident%e2%80%91handling-und-meldestelle"&gt;Monitoring, Incident‑Handling und Meldestelle&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der dritte Bereich, in dem NIS2 schnell zum Papiertiger wird, ist die Kombination aus Monitoring, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3842982/6-wichtige-punkte-fur-ihren-incident-response-plan.html"&gt;Incident Response&lt;/a&gt; und den neuen Meldepflichten. Die Richtlinie gibt klare Deadlines vor: Frühwarnung innerhalb von 24 Stunden, eine strukturierte Meldung nach 72 Stunden, ein Abschlussbericht nach spätestens einem Monat. Viele Organisationen reagieren darauf, indem sie neue Templates, Excel‑Listen und Meldehandbücher bauen – oft weitgehend losgelöst vom bestehenden SOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Ernstfall bedeutet das: Das SOC bekämpft den Vorfall, während parallel eine „NIS2‑Taskforce“ versucht, Informationen aus Tickets, Mails und Ad‑hoc‑Chats so aufzubereiten, dass sie in ein Formular passen. Die Folge sind doppelte Arbeit, Informationsverluste und Berichte, die zwar Seiten füllen, aber wenig darüber sagen, wie gut Detection und Response tatsächlich funktionieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In einer Cloud‑SaaS‑Umgebung bietet sich ein anderer Weg an: Statt NIS2‑Reporting als eigenes Dokumentenprojekt zu verstehen, wird ein modernes DevSecOps‑basiertes SOC aufgebaut, so dass alle sicherheitsrelevanten Signale von vornherein an einem Ort zusammenlaufen: Cloud‑Infrastruktur, CI/CD‑Pipelines, Anwendungen, IdP und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495114/identity-access-managementdie-9-besten-iam-tools.html"&gt;IAM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Regeln, nach denen diese Daten korreliert, angereichert und in Incidents überführt werden, sind als Code definiert und versioniert. T Detection‑Logik (Threat Detection and Response), Schwellenwerte und Playbooks liegen im Repository und werden wie Anwendungscode über Pipelines ausgerollt. Große Teile der klassischen SOC‑Arbeit lassen sich damit automatisieren: Aus Roh‑Logs werden konsistente Incidents mit Kontext, ohne dass jemand manuell Textbausteine zusammenkopieren muss. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/de-at/security/business/security-101/what-is-cnapp"&gt;CNAPP&lt;/a&gt; (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform ) und ähnliche Plattformen übernehmen gleichzeitig Speicherung und Archivierung der Daten, sodass der Nachweis der Überwachungstätigkeit im System mitläuft, statt in gesonderten Doku‑Schleifen erzeugt zu werden. Machine‑Learning‑ und AI‑Komponenten helfen zusätzlich, False Positives zu reduzieren, ähnliche Ereignisse zu clustern und auffällige Muster hervorzuheben – das SOC konzentriert sich auf die wenigen Vorfälle, die wirklich Aufmerksamkeit brauchen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auf Prozessebene bleiben Playbooks und Meldewege wichtig – aber schlank. Ein IR‑Playbook definiert Incident‑Klassen, Eskalationspfade und Kommunikationsregeln, inklusive der Kriterien, ab wann ein Vorfall als „NIS2‑signifikant“ gilt. Ein Meldeprozess regelt, wer die Informationen aus SOC und Fachbereichen konsolidiert und über die BSI‑Meldestelle einreicht.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die eigentliche Dokumentation entsteht auch hier im Wesentlichen automatisch: Incident‑Tickets enthalten Timeline, betroffene Services, Impact, Ursache und Maßnahmen; ein Kennzeichen „NIS2‑relevant“ und ein Meldestatus verknüpfen sie mit den externen Berichten. Aus &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492608/was-ist-siem.html"&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt;‑ und IR‑Daten lassen sich Kennzahlen wie MTTD, MTTR oder die Zeit zwischen Detection und Erstmeldung direkt berechnen – genau die Größen, an denen sich ablesen lässt, ob NIS2 gelebter Prozess ist oder nur eine neue Schublade im Dokumentenschrank.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nis2-als-architektur%e2%80%91test-nicht-nur-als-doku%e2%80%91ubung"&gt;NIS2 als Architektur‑Test, nicht nur als Doku‑Übung&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIS2 zwingt Unternehmen, ihre Sicherheitsmaßnahmen, Prozesse und Nachweise explizit zu machen. Das ist unbequem – gerade für Organisationen, die bisher stark ad hoc gearbeitet haben. Ob daraus ein Papiertiger oder ein echter Sicherheitsgewinn wird, entscheidet sich aber nicht im Gesetzestext, sondern in der Architektur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wer versucht, die Richtlinie vor allem mit Word, PowerPoint und Excel „wegzudokumentieren“, wird viel Aufwand und wenig Resilienz produzieren. Werden hingegen IdP und IAM, CI/CD‑Pipelines, SBOM‑ und Vulnerability‑Tools, SIEM und IR‑Plattform so aufgesetzt, dass sie die geforderten Controls und Nachweise quasi nebenbei liefern, bekommt man NIS2‑Compliance als Nebeneffekt einer modernen Security‑Landschaft. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Racks, sprawl and the myth of redundancy: Why your failover isn’t as safe as you think</title>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-physical-roots-of-resilience"&gt;The physical roots of resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, at 2 a.m., I stood in a data center aisle watching a core switch lose a power supply. The room was cold, the fans loud and the alert light blinked amber. Within four seconds, the backup unit took over. Not a single packet dropped. That seamless, silent shift captured the essence of networking redundancy at its best: automatic, invisible and flawless. It was the kind of moment engineers live for — a quiet victory in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, that same principle faces relentless pressure. Networks have outgrown physical racks and now span hybrid clouds, edge nodes, SD-WAN overlays, API gateways and micro-segmented virtual fabrics. Redundancy no longer means just extra hardware or twin fiber links. It demands survival against misconfigured routing policies, regional DNS outages, zero-day exploits in router firmware and cascading failures triggered by human error or supply chain compromise. The landscape has evolved dramatically, but the core lessons — built on discipline, foresight and trust — endure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My journey began with physical infrastructure, back when reliability was measured in cables and chassis. Every server connected through dual paths, with link aggregation bundles split across two top-of-rack switches, each uplinked to separate core routers over distinct fiber routes. I once spent an entire weekend labeling cables with color-coded heat shrink: red for primary, blue for backup. It was meticulous, almost meditative work. When a technician accidentally kicked a patch cord loose during a floor tile replacement, traffic shifted in under 200 milliseconds. No alarms triggered. No user complaints. The monitoring dashboard stayed green. That reliability felt like muscle memory: predictable, testable and deeply tangible. It was redundancy you could touch, trace and trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cloud-complexity-and-policy-traps"&gt;Cloud complexity and policy traps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Networks, however, no longer stay confined to racks. They live in routing tables, BGP sessions, cloud control planes and software-defined overlays. Many organizations rush to multi-region cloud setups, believing geographic distance alone guarantees resilience. It does not. Last year, I oversaw a global e-commerce platform with active-passive failover across two regions. Health checks withdrew prefixes from the primary if latency crossed 80 ms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a routine maintenance window, a junior engineer mistyped a BGP community tag. Instead of marking one subnet, the change blocked the entire backup path with a no-export rule. Traffic surged onto an already saturated primary link, pushing packet loss to 11 percent. The backup route was healthy, advertising correctly and fully reachable — yet policy prevented its use. We corrected the error in six minutes, but customers felt the impact for nearly 40. The takeaway was stark: redundancy without aligned policies is mere decoration, expensive and useless when it matters most. This mirrors the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-1111-incident-on-june-27-2024/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 hijack incident&lt;/a&gt; caused by a leaked border gateway (BGP) route.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As cloud environments grow, consistency becomes harder to maintain. A small template tweak in one availability zone can cascade across regions if copied unchecked, turning intended protection into widespread failure. Teams now manage configurations like code, with versioning, peer reviews, staged testing and automation to enforce uniformity. Tools like infrastructure-as-code pipelines, policy engines and drift detection systems are no longer optional — they are the new standard for scalable resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SD-WAN extends these challenges to branch locations, linking multiple internet paths for fluid failover and intelligent, application-aware routing. It promises simplicity and agility. Yet a single carrier firmware update can degrade performance everywhere, even when links remain active. I’ve seen MTU mismatches, encryption mismatches and path preference bugs ripple through hundreds of sites in minutes. Phased rollouts, strict change policies and gradual deployment rings prevent blanket disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same discipline applies at the edge, where devices in retail stores, warehouses or remote clinics depend on local backups for speed and continuity. A rushed firmware push can erase that safety net across all units, forcing field teams to restore from USB drives or mobile hotspots. Careful staging, rollback plans and on-site recovery kits are now part of every deployment checklist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Routing mistakes and DNS breakdowns lurk as quiet, persistent risks. One errant rule can dead-end traffic and even solid backups stay idle if policies block them. Robust prefix filters, route validation and RPKI enforcement keep paths safe. Likewise, DNS backups must operate independently — free of shared anycast IPs, providers or control planes — to avoid joint collapse. Security checks, DNSSEC and diverse resolver strategies strengthen failover. These are not add-ons; they are foundational to modern network hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="anticipating-the-inevitable-pre-mortem-and-defense-in-depth"&gt;Anticipating the inevitable: Pre-mortem and defense in depth&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next outage is already taking shape, hidden until the first alert. It might hide in a supply chain flaw inside a trusted IOS-XR patch, quietly altering routes worldwide. Or it could stem from a single flawed intent policy in an ACI fabric, isolating entire application layers with surgical precision. External forces like wildfires, floods or geopolitical events can force data center evacuations, knocking out power grids and delaying generators for hours. The &lt;a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/summary-of-june-8-outage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Fastly global outage&lt;/a&gt; — triggered by one valid config change exposing a hidden bug — shows how fast a CDN can collapse. These scenarios are not speculation; they are probabilities waiting to strike, each with its own failure signature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experience reframes the question. Failure is inevitable in infrastructure work. What matters is how it unfolds, how precisely and whether the design anticipates that exact failure mode. Resilience now means shaping failure’s impact, not stopping it. This mindset demands a new ritual: the pre-mortem. In every design review, we assume total failure at peak load. We trace dependencies — transit providers, certificate authorities, undersea cables, even physical access roads. We hunt for shared fate: two “diverse” carriers in the same conduit, a single control plane for multi-region DNS or a vendor update applied globally without validation. Each discovery triggers action: a new peer, a policy rewrite, a satellite link or a dark fiber lease. &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AWS recommends pre-mortems in its Reliability Pillar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I sat in a dim network operations center at 3 a.m., cold coffee forgotten, as one BGP update spread chaos via a global transit provider. A peer leaked a default route with lower preference, sucking outbound traffic into oblivion. The backup path was fully functional, yet our policy still favored the tainted route. For 17 minutes, half the internet vanished for users. Customers raged. Executives demanded answers. A swift prefix filter fixed it, but the lesson lingered: redundancy requires not just a second path, but intelligence to choose it wisely and reject the wrong one. That night, I rewrote our change process: no routing policy touches production without simulation, peer review and automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observability unifies the picture. A consolidated view of logs, traffic flows, performance metrics and control plane health spots weakening paths before collapse, enabling fixes before users notice. Cost tensions persist. Leaders crave full redundancy yet settle for cheaper, correlated links that fail together. Genuine resilience needs true separation, geographic distance and sometimes higher budgets, all justified by the disruptions avoided. A $50,000 cross-connect can prevent a $2 million outage. The math is simple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Automation now manages routine failovers, sensing issues and shifting traffic instantly so engineers tackle root causes, not manual switches. The next disruption looms from software bugs, policy slips, physical cuts or zero-day attacks. Effective planning means expecting breakdown, mapping vulnerabilities and scripting clear recovery. In a recent breach, an attacker tried hijacking core routing via a compromised jump host. Layered defenses — RPKI, prefix filters and automated session resets — contained it. Users saw only a 40 ms blip. Redundancy had matured from spare cables into a dynamic blend of security, automation and vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The foundational principles hold: remove single points of failure, secure real separation, automate responses and monitor relentlessly. The scale has ballooned — from patch panels to cloud regions, from local switches to global routes — but the mission stays constant: keep data moving regardless of obstacles. Outages will come. They always do. But with redundancy woven into a tested, trusted and adaptable network, their sting will fade and the packets will keep flowing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
