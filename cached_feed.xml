      <title>November Patch Tuesday: Zero day Windows kernel flaw in servers, controllers, and PCs</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4088341/november-patch-tuesday-zero-day-windows-kernel-flaw-in-servers-controllers-and-pcs.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A zero day elevation of privilege Windows kernel flaw in servers, controllers, and desktops is being actively exploited and needs to be patched immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the advice of &lt;a href="https://www.tenable.com/profile/satnam-narang" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Satnam Narang&lt;/a&gt;, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, on one of the two biggest vulnerabilities that needs to be addressed from among the 63 holes identified by Microsoft in today’s November Patch Tuesday releases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Separately, SAP today released four HotNews Notes and two HighPriority Notes among its 26 new and updated security patches. One patch deletes the SQL Anywhere Monitor because of hard-coded credentials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also today, Adobe released eight updates, while Mozilla released three.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="windows-kernel-flaw"&gt;Windows kernel flaw&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most urgent of the Microsoft holes to be addressed is &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62215" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-62215&lt;/a&gt; (the Windows kernel vulnerability),” Narang told &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “While there is a substantial prerequisite to exploit the bug, Microsoft confirmed active exploitation is underway. The consequences cannot be ignored, as elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are the keys to opening other doors within the organization. This is how attackers go from initial foothold to full-blown breach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, &lt;a href="https://www.action1.com/team/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mike Walters&lt;/a&gt;, president of Action1, points out, this vulnerability impacts servers and domain controllers as much as desktops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ivanti.com/blog/authors/chris-goettl" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Goettl&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of product management at Ivanti, notes that this vulnerability affects all currently supported Windows OS editions plus the Windows 10 machines covered by the ESU (Extended Security Updates) program, “which means running Windows 10 past the end-of life (EOL) is not a hypothetical risk.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/author/ben-mccarthy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ben McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, lead cyber security engineer at Immersive, explained how this hole can be exploited. An attacker with low-privilege local access can run a specially crafted application that repeatedly attempts to trigger a race condition. The goal is to get multiple threads to interact with a shared kernel resource in an unsynchronized way, confusing the kernel’s memory management and causing it to free the same memory block twice. This successful “double free” corrupts the kernel heap, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory and hijack the system’s execution flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says while the attack complexity to exploit this hole is high — successful exploitation requires an attacker to win a race condition — the privileges required are low. And the prize is great: An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain SYSTEM privileges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those in the Windows ESU program should note that, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasacarroll/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Carroll&lt;/a&gt;, cyber incident response manager at Nightwing, some users have been reporting issues enrolling in the Extended Security Update program. Microsoft has recently released an out-of-band update to address issues when users try to enroll in the Windows 10 Consumer Extended Security Update program, he said. Admins planning to participate in the program should make sure to update and install &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/november-11-2025-kb5071959-windows-10-version-22h2-os-build-19045-6466-out-of-band-565c78a7-5b5f-4cbd-8ca8-2a73a48f4e2b" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;KB5071959&lt;/a&gt; to address the enrollment issues. After that is installed, users should be able to install other updates such as today’s KB5068781, which is the latest update to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="flaw-in-visual-studio-copilot-extension"&gt;Flaw in Visual Studio Copilot Extension&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second major vulnerability is &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62222" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-62222&lt;/a&gt;, a remote code execution flaw in Microsoft Visual Studio Code Copilot Chat Extension. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it is rated as less likely to be exploited, Narang said, it “underscores a growing interest in finding bugs in generative AI or agentic AI, which encompasses large language models, whether foundational models or open source models, and the AI-assisted code editing tools.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2025/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Researchers at Cisco Systems said&lt;/a&gt; exploitation is not trivial for this vulnerability, as it requires multiple steps: prompt injection, Copilot Agent interaction, and triggering a build. Cisco notes that Microsoft assessed that the attack complexity is “high”, and that exploitation is “less likely”.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs should already be addressing emerging AI risks with governance and policy enforcement, added Narang. “If Shadow AI and unchecked sanctioned AI usage run rampant through their organization, CSOs must modify their strategy to govern this emerging, complex attack surface before it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kerberos-vulnerability"&gt;Kerberos vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the fixes released is one for &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60704" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-60704&lt;/a&gt;, a Kerboros delegation vulnerability in Active Directory dubbed CheckSum by researchers at Silverfort, who discovered it. If exploited, an attacker could impersonate an authenticated user, escalate privileges and stay hidden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because Kerberos is a way to enable applications to authenticate securely on behalf of users, abuse of it can  be dangerous, Silverfort says in an explanation of this vulnerability. Using a man-in-the-middle technique, the flaw allows researchers to impersonate arbitrary users and ultimately gain control over the entire domain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any organization using Active Directory with the Kerberos delegation capability turned on is impacted,” says Silverfort. “This means thousands of companies around the world are affected by this vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-graphics-component-flaw"&gt;Microsoft Graphics Component flaw&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tyler Reguly, associate director of R&amp;amp;D at Fortra, was drawn to &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60724" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-60724&lt;/a&gt;, one of several vulnerabilities rated critical in severity. It’s a heap-based buffer overflow in Microsoft Graphics Component that could allow an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He notes that Microsoft says, “in the worst-case scenario, an attacker could trigger this vulnerability on web services by uploading documents containing a specially crafted metafile without user interaction.”   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I’m a CISO, then CVE-2025-60724 has me worried this month,” he told &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt;. “We have a vulnerability that Microsoft and CVSS agree is critical and an attack vector that requires no user interaction and no privileges, just the ability to upload a file. We know nothing about the file type, the technologies that are impacted (other than GDI+ in the title), or the services impacted. Do I need to worry about my SharePoint infrastructure? What about third-party software – my wiki or my bug tracker? This is definitely one that feels a little spooky without a lot of extra details being provided.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco explains the vulnerability can be triggered by convincing a victim open a document that contains a specially crafted metafile.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the worst-case scenario,” its researchers write, “an attacker could trigger this vulnerability on web services by uploading documents containing a specially crafted metafile without user interaction. An attacker doesn’t require any privileges on the systems hosting the web services. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause RCE or information disclosure on web services that are parsing documents that contain a specially crafted metafile, without the involvement of a victim user.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="sap-patches"&gt;SAP patches&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patches released by SAP today include some Notes that are updates to previously related fixes. That includes two HotNews patches. But there are new two patches, rated high priority by Onapsis, dealing with SAP Commerce Cloud (with a CVSS score of 7.5) and SAP CommonCryptoLib (also with a score of 7.5).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the notes, &lt;a href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3666261" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;#3666261&lt;/a&gt;, has a CVSS score of 10. It deals with an insecure key and secret management vulnerability in SQL Anywhere Monitor with hard-coded credentials. SQL Anywhere Monitor is a browser-based administration tool that gives admins information about the health and availability of SQL Anywhere databases, MobiLink servers, and MobiLink server farms. It can also provide information about the availability of web servers, proxy servers, and host computers;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patch removes SQL Anywhere Monitor completely, &lt;a href="https://onapsis.com/blog/sap-security-patch-day-november-2025/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;say researchers at Onapsis&lt;/a&gt;. As a temporary workaround, SAP recommends that admins stop using this tool and delete any instances of SQL Anywhere Monitor database.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another note to pay attention to, &lt;a href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3668705" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;#3668705&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-42887" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-42887&lt;/a&gt;) patches a code injection vulnerability in SAP Solution Manager. Due to missing input sanitization in a remote-enabled function module, authenticated attackers are able to inject malicious code into the system. Rated with a CVSS score of 9.9, this vulnerability is patched by adding an input check that rejects most of the non-alphanumeric characters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CVE-2025-42887 is particularly dangerous because it allows an attacker to inject code from a low-privileged user, which leads to a full SAP compromise and all data contained in the SAP system,” notes  Joris van de Vis, director of security research at SecurityBridge. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Onapsis CTO Juan Pablo Perez-Etchegoyen also says admins need to deal quickly with Note #&lt;a href="https://me.sap.com/notes/3633049" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3633049&lt;/a&gt;. “Despite this being a CVSS 7.5,” he said in an email to &lt;em&gt;CSO&lt;/em&gt;, “it is a memory corruption potentially exploitable remotely pre-authentication, and these types of vulnerability tend to be very critical because of their nature and potential for denial of service and system compromise.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, with many of these vulnerabilities, patching alone is not enough: architecture, exposure, segmentation, and monitoring still matter, advises Mike Walters of Action1. “CSOs need to involve not just patching teams, but also service owners (print, scan, document sharing, remote access), network/security teams (for segmentation and exposure control), and logging/monitoring teams (for post-patch verification),” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Europol is calling for a coordinated European response to tackle caller ID spoofing, an in increasingly common tool, used for online fraud and social engineering scams. Caller ID spoofing occurs when criminals falsify the information displayed on phones, making numbers appear legitimate to deceive victims. This practice is driving substantial financial and societal harm, with an estimated EUR 850 million lost worldwide each year.</description>

      <title>Beyond the checklist: Shifting from compliance frameworks to real-time risk assessments</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4088198/beyond-the-checklist-shifting-from-compliance-frameworks-to-real-time-risk-assessments.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To keep up with a quickly changing threat environment, organizations are reassessing how they assess risk. They no longer view them only as a once-a-year exercise. They recognize their value as important tools for making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many still confuse gap analysis with risk assessment, the difference is important. A &lt;a href="https://www.knbbs.com/why-conduct-information-security-gap-analysis-and-how-to-do-it-effectively/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gap analysis&lt;/a&gt; measures how well a company follows a specific set of controls, often linked to frameworks like &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/iso-iec-27000-family" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NIST&lt;/a&gt;. A risk assessment, on the other hand, can be customized to look at any threat. This allows security leaders to focus their assessments where they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I had just started a new role as a CISO and quickly realized that access control was a big issue. Every user in every system seemed to have admin privileges. I decided to assess every critical system for the threat of unauthorized access and tailored the assessment by focusing on that threat. We asked questions like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What types of data does your system store?” (for impact calculation)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“How many users have administrative permissions?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Can granular user access be assigned based on need?” (RBAC)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“What authentication methods are used?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Are there audit logs?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combine the access control assessment results with a well-written report that assigns the risk to the business owner, and I had an effective tool for bringing awareness and change to the organization around managing access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="beyond-frameworks-why-static-models-fall-short"&gt;Beyond frameworks: Why static models fall short&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity frameworks provide necessary structure, but they are largely static and cannot substitute for real-time risk processes. Most compliance frameworks require an annual risk assessment because they often lag behind in covering rapidly evolving threats. Relying only on framework-based assessments risks overlooking important issues. This includes matters that go beyond static controls, such as AI adoption, cloud service updates and third-party dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These gaps highlight the importance of combining a solid compliance stance while regularly tailoring assessments to current realities. Frameworks are updated on multi-year cycles, while threats evolve daily. Organizations must focus on what really matters: key business assets, changing technologies and real-world operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="focused-risk-assessments-less-is-more"&gt;Focused risk assessments: Less is more&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional framework reviews can involve hundreds of controls and questions, which may be appropriate for large compliance engagements but are often impractical for smaller teams or fast-moving environments. A focused risk assessment, by contrast, can be built around 20–40 targeted questions. These assessments concentrate on high-probability, high-impact threats and the few controls that materially reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one real-world example, I designed a 26-question assessment that helped a mid-sized organization zero in on its most pressing vulnerabilities. The result was a clear, actionable roadmap that delivered immediate value without the overhead of a full framework review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This method is particularly beneficial when resources are scarce for organizations. By narrowing the scope, teams are able to rapidly identify and solve the highest priority risks, providing a good foundation for further action like targeted remediation or complete framework alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="frequency-over-formality"&gt;Frequency over formality&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked aspects of risk assessments is cadence. While gap analyses are sometimes done yearly or to prepare for large-scale audits, risk assessments need to be continuous or performed on a regular schedule. Threats do not respect calendar cycles. Major changes, including new technologies, mergers, regulatory changes or implementing AI, need to trigger reassessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integrating risk assessments into regular governance practices, such as quarterly reviews of high-risk assets, evaluations after significant changes and annual assessments, helps organizations stay ahead of evolving threats. Moving to a dynamic approach to risk management from a static one is essential for developing long-term strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="designing-an-effective-risk-assessment"&gt;Designing an effective risk assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A modern risk assessment begins with business context. What are the critical assets, processes and outcomes that must be protected? From there, organizations can identify the most likely threat paths and the controls that reduce those risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than cataloging every control in a framework, the focus should be on threat-and-control alignment. For example, if ransomware is a major concern, the assessment should focus on controls related to backups, restores, authentication and user awareness. Many organizations regularly back up their data, but they often neglect to test their restoration process. This leaves them at risk when it really counts. In this context, relying solely on backups provides a false sense of security; the real value lies in the ability to restore. A good assessment can uncover these issues and put focus on their priority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging vectors such as AI, cloud misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities should be explicitly included. These areas often fall outside traditional frameworks but represent significant risk. To assess AI risk for example, ask these questions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“How do you use AI?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“What data does your AI have access to?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Do you make business decisions using AI?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Is AI used for automation?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these simple questions, you can uncover hidden exposures, which are especially critical when sensitive data is involved or decision-making is automated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A simple, repeatable scoring model that rates likelihood and impact helps turn findings into remediation priorities. Consistency across assessments enables trend analysis and supports executive decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="executive-grade-outputs"&gt;Executive-grade outputs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Risk assessments should culminate in outputs that business leaders can act on. This includes a concise risk heat map, a prioritized remediation roadmap and clear asks, such as budget, ownership and timelines. These deliverables convert technical findings into strategic decisions. They also help build trust with stakeholders, especially in organizations that may be new to formal risk management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="target-for-smaller-teams"&gt;Target for smaller teams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Targeted risk assessments can be viewed as a low-cost, fundamental option. They are best suited to companies that have limited budget or are not prepared for a full review of the framework. With reduced scope, shorter turnaround and transparent business value, such assessments enable rapid establishment of trust, delivering prioritized outcomes. They help to create a roadmap for deeper engagement and make cybersecurity accessible to smaller teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By starting small, organizations can build credibility and expand into broader programs, such as continuous monitoring, remediation or full framework alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-pragmatic-mindset"&gt;A pragmatic mindset&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Risk assessments are not just checkboxes. They are tools for making decisions. The best programs are aligned with the business, focused, consistent and made to change over time. For many organizations, a short, focused assessment gives executives the evidence they need to justify budgets and demonstrate due diligence. It delivers immediate value and creates a pathway to sustained risk management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Malicious npm package sneaks into GitHub Actions builds</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4088529/malicious-npm-package-sneaks-into-github-actions-builds.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A malicious npm package named “@acitons/artifact” was found impersonating the legitimate “@actions/artifact” module, directly targeting the CI/CD pipelines within GitHub Actions workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Veracode findings, the package was uploaded on November 7 and was designed to trigger during the build process of GitHub-owned repositories. Once executed inside a CI/CD runner, the payload captures any tokens available to that build environment and then uses those credentials to publish malicious artifacts–effectively impersonating GitHub itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This incident isn’t just about a malicious npm package, it is about the blind trust many organizations place in the modern supply chain,” said Randolph Barr, CISO at Cequence Security. “Most organizations focus their controls on runtime environments, yet the CI/CD pipeline often runs with higher privilege than any developer. A single typosquatted dependency can silently execute code during a build, access repository tokens, and impersonate an organization, just as this attack attempted to do with GitHub’s own repositories.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malicious package picked up over 260k downloads before detection, and a total of six versions were uploaded–none detectable by “any popular anti-virus” products, Veracode researchers noted in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GitHub says that the packages were uploaded internally as part of its red teaming efforts. “The packages referenced in Veracode’s blog were part of a tightly controlled exercise conducted by GitHub’s Red Team,” a GitHub spokesperson told CSO. “GitHub takes security seriously and regularly tests its security posture through rigorous, realistic Red Team exercises to ensure resilience against current threat actor techniques. At no point were GitHub systems or data at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hijacking the GitHub Actions build process&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the surface, @acitons/artifact package looked normal with its metadata describing it as “actions artifact lib,” and its homepage and repository URLs closely mirroring those of the legitimate GitHub project. But embedded inside was a post-install hook that downloaded and executed an obfuscated shell script named “harness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Veracode’s &lt;a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/malicious-npm-package-targeting-github-actions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that this script, compiled with a shell-script compiler tool, contained a time-based kill switch set to deactivate after November 6, 2025–likely to evade detection after a brief active window. Once invoked, the harness would fetch a JavaScript file (“verify.js” meant to check whether the build environment belonged to GitHub and, if so, exfiltrate &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4052826/ghostaction-campaign-steals-3325-secrets-in-github-supply-chain-attack.html"&gt;GitHub Action&lt;/a&gt; tokens. These tokens could then be misused to impersonate GitHub and publish malicious releases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Typosquatting is a well-known and growing threat vector in software supply chains whereby attackers publish packages with similar names as legitimate ones and then wait for a mistake to happen, bringing the victim to their repository to install malicious code by mistake,” explained Boris Cipot, Senior Security Engineer at Black Duck. “This attack strategy is designed to exploit typos and to leverage the automated nature of CI/CD pipelines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cipot added that the use of a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4081790/typo-hackers-sneak-cross-platform-credential-stealer-into-10-npm-packages.html?utm=hybrid_search#:~:text=npm%20postinstall%20script"&gt;post-install hook&lt;/a&gt; and a short-lived obfuscated payload shows a deliberate attempt to blend in with normal build activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lessons-in-defense"&gt;Lessons in defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barr pointed out that higher privileges in CI/CD pipelines make them an ideal target. Attackers who compromise a build runner can inject code at the source, sign releases with legitimate credentials, or push authentic-looking artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mitigations, Cipot recommended, would include short-lived, scoped tokens with regular secret rotations. Automated scanning for suspicious packages using tools like Socket.dev or Phylum might also help stay ahead of the threat. Other ways to verify package authenticity include checksum validation and emerging standards like &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/572893/sigstore-explained-how-it-helps-secure-the-software-supply-chain.html"&gt;Sigstore&lt;/a&gt;, he added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Soroko, senior fellow at Sectigo, advises an immediate response for teams potentially affected. “Search source code, lockfiles, caches, and registries for @acitons and 8jfiesaf83 then quarantine any runners that fetched them,” he said. “Rotate all tokens and review artifacts and package publish history for the period from October 29 to November 6, 2025.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>End of the game for cybercrime infrastructure: 1025 servers taken down</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down</link>
      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

      <title>Google asks US court to shut down Lighthouse phishing-as-a-service operation</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4088993/google-asks-us-court-to-shut-down-lighthouse-phishing-as-a-service-operation.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google is asking to a US court for help in dismantling the infrastructure behind the Lighthouse phishing-as-a-service operation, the latest effort by a technology company to use the legal system to put a dent in cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether it will do more than that is an open question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a blog Monday, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/legal-action-and-legislation-fight-scammers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado said&lt;/a&gt; the court action is needed because the gang behind this scam exploits Google and other brands by illegally displaying their trademarks and services on fraudulent websites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found at least 107 website templates featuring Google’s branding on sign-in screens specifically designed to trick people into believing the sites are legitimate,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors who buy access to the Lighthouse service send text messages to people, including employees of organizations, with branding appearing to come from a legitimate provider. They hope the branding is convincing enough to induce an unwary person to click a link and share information such as email credentials, banking information and more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="many-court-orders-sought"&gt;Many court orders sought&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google’s action follows that of other technology companies, most notably Microsoft, as well as some countries, to dampen the efforts of threat actors through the courts. For example, &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/16/microsoft-seizes-338-websites-to-disrupt-rapidly-growing-raccoono365-phishing-service/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in September, Microsoft got a court order allowing it to seize 338 websites &lt;/a&gt;associated with the distribution of RacoonO365, a phishing kit used to steal Microsoft 365 credentials. Since July 2024, RaccoonO365’s kits have been used to steal at least 5,000 Microsoft credentials from people in 94 countries, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/10/taking-legal-action-to-protect-the-public-from-abusive-ai-generated-content/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;got a US court order allowing it to seize a website&lt;/a&gt; behind a foreign-based threat actor distributing tools for bypassing safety guardrails of generative AI services of several tech companies, including its own. The threat actor’s software exploited exposed customer credentials scraped from public websites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in August, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-coordinated-disruption-actions-against-blacksuit-royal" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the US Justice Department announced coordinated actions&lt;/a&gt; against the BlackSuit (Royal) Ransomware group which included the takedown of four servers and nine domains, with the help of the FBI and international law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, France, Canada, Ukraine, and Lithuania. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, threat actors can be resilient. For example, in 2020 Microsoft, Symantec, ESET, communications provider NTT, and Lumen Technologies combined with others to&lt;a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/trickbot-botnet-ransomware-disruption" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; get a US court order&lt;/a&gt; directing web hosting providers to take down the IT infrastructure distributing the Trickbot botnet. But a&lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-trickbot" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ccording to researchers at Huntress&lt;/a&gt;, TrickBot is still being used by threat actors for remote access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Google blog also said the company is urging the US Congress to adopt the Guarding Unprotected Aging Retirees from Deception (GUARD) Act, which would enable state and local law enforcement to utilize federal grant funding to investigate financial fraud and scams specifically targeting retirees; the Foreign Robocall Elimination Act, which would establish a taskforce focused on how to best block foreign-originated illegal robocalls before they ever reach American consumers; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61864" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Scam Compound Accountability and Mobilization&lt;/a&gt; (SCAM) Act, which would develop a national strategy to counter scam compounds, enhance sanctions, and support survivors of human trafficking within these compounds. Scam compounds are physical installations where significant transnational criminal organizations carry out cyber-enabled fraud operations, frequently using the forced labor of victims of human trafficking&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google refused a request for an interview to get more details about its announcement, explaining it had nothing more to say beyond DeLaine Prado’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="will-have-minimal-impact"&gt;Will have ‘minimal impact’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cypfer.com/team-member/ed-dubrovsky/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ed Dubrovsky&lt;/a&gt;, chief operating officer of incident response firm Cypher, is skeptical of the effectiveness of court action. Phishing-as-a-service operations don’t have to be on American soil, he explained, so court orders and legislation will likely have minimal impact on smishing or phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However,” he added, “I can understand that even small steps can lead to broader impact, and that might be why Google is taking these steps.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this and similar court actions won’t change threat actor behavior or the need for IT departments to have controls to face cyber risks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellman/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kellman Meghu,&lt;/a&gt; principal security architect at Canadian incident response firm DeepCove Cybersecurity, believes Google and other tech firms around the world are looking to the courts and legislatures in part to stop scams, but also to protect themselves from being sued if they can shut down a criminal online service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The reality now is that there is very little to no risk to running scams,” he told CSO in an email, “since the chance of suffering any ramifications is barely a reality. [Running a malicious online operation] gives attackers the chance to just keep trying things until eventually something works. Driving real legislation and legal impacts that can span borders would be very valuable to reduce this threat, if in fact they can build legislation that is effective, and could go a long way in reducing the risk of constant attempts to compromise users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But global efforts to fight cybercrime can only be effective if tech companies around the world work with governments to share information on cyber crime, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he doubts many competitive technology suppliers would join an effort because they have a vested interest in saying that they are safer, better, faster than the competition, so they can sell more services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="any-reduction-in-scams-would-help-it-departments"&gt;‘Any reduction in scams would help IT departments’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich,&lt;/a&gt; dean of research at the SANS Institute, said Google has a huge problem with scammers paying for ads that direct victims to fraudulent websites and malware. “Any reduction in these scams would be a significant help to IT departments,” he said, “making it easier to defend networks against these scams.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposed US legislation doesn’t necessarily add any substantial new barriers for scammers, he added, but it would provide more funding for state and local law enforcement agencies that are often overwhelmed by complaints from victims of cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, he argued that robocalls could be fought more effectively by telecommunication providers, without new legislation, and they have taken some steps to do so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue of scam compounds is likely not going to be significantly affected by any legislation, as they are too ephemeral and agile and would easily evade sanctions, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Among the issues mentioned, the paid-for Google ads advertising malicious resources is by far the most significant problem for security teams,” Ullrich said. “Google must step up its game in blocking them, and finding legal ways to eradicate the origin may be more effective than the current ‘whack the mole’ tactic, which is not working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>On 4 November 2025, an international coordinated action day targeted three major fraud and money laundering networks as part of Operation “Chargeback.” Led by the Cybercrime Department (Landeszentralstelle Cybercrime) of the General Prosecutor's Office (Generalstaatsanwaltschaft) in Koblenz, Germany, and the German Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt), the operation has been investigating these networks since December 2020. More than 60 house searches were conducted and a total of 18 arrest warrants executed. The criminal networks are suspected of misusing credit card data from over 4.3 million cardholders across 193 countries. In total, the estimated damage from the fraud scheme exceeds EUR 300 million, with attempted damages amounting to over EUR 750 million.</description>

      <title>54 individuals arrested in action against labour exploitation</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/54-individuals-arrested-in-action-against-labour-exploitation</link>
      <description>Over the last weeks, law enforcement, border guards and labour and tax authorities across Europe joined forces to identify and tackle labour exploitation. This recent edition of the EMPACT Joint Action Days targeted trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation purposes, with a special emphasis on the agricultural sector, gastronomy, and temporary work agencies. In particular, the involved authorities also took measures against the exploitation of non-EU nationals and refugees. Led by France and the Netherlands, and carried out by authorities from 32 countries with support from Europol and the European Labour Authority (ELA), the action days resulted in the arrest of 54 individuals and identification of 404 potential victims of human trafficking.</description>

      <title>What CISOs need to know about new tools for securing MCP servers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4087656/what-cisos-need-to-know-about-new-tools-for-securing-mcp-servers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model Context Protocol allows AI agents to connect to data sources but the first iteration of this standard &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015222/mcp-uses-and-risks.html"&gt;lacked serious security&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few months, a multitude of vendors appeared to help solve the problem. Is the technology now ready for prime-time, or is it still too early to put into production?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some progress has been made on the core protocol side. In March, support was added for OAuth authentication, and in June, the protocol added support for third-party authentication servers such as Auth0, Okta, or a company’s own identity management system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MCP standards body also launched an official &lt;a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.info/tools/registry/"&gt;MCP registry&lt;/a&gt; in September, in order to address the problem of malicious MCP servers masquerading as legitimate ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But significant security gaps remain. For example, authentication is optional, and the systems are vulnerable to prompt injections, tool poisoning, token theft, cross-server attacks, message tampering and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies looking to get ahead of the competition when it comes to building agentic AI systems have to do a lot of security heavy lifting to keep these tools from exposing all their corporate secrets and sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, over the past few months, vendors have been stepping up. Today, the major AI platforms have added security infrastructure, as have core technology providers, existing cybersecurity vendors, and a fleet of emerging players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-of-different-uses-of-mcp-servers"&gt;Challenges of different uses of MCP servers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of MCP server deployments, and each one has their own security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a company sets up an internal MCP server, on infrastructure they control, to access internal data or tools, to be used by AI agents that they also control. First, a low-risk use of this might be to allow employees to use AI agents to search through non-sensitive documents or databases, such as product descriptions. A higher-risk use case might be to allow access to customer data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, a company might allow their AI agents to access external data sources or tools via MCP servers. Here, one concern might be that the information the AI agents get back might include malicious instructions because either the server or the data source is compromised by an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third deployment type is that of an internal MCP server exposing a company’s data or tools to the outside world. Again, this could be a low-risk use case if the MCP server provides access to product descriptions or user manuals. But it could also be extremely risky if MCP servers that allow external partners to connect in and place orders, submit invoices, and change their payment addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are ways to ease into MCP deployments, says Anh Hatzopoulos, co-founder and CEO at PepperMill, a no-code AI platform. For example, an MCP server that goes and gets public LinkedIn information is going to be safer than one that handles financial transactions, she says. “With moving money, I’m surprised that people are going hard at it right now, given the security problems with MCPs. But someone has to do it — and someone will discover those security problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, for many tech companies, especially SaaS vendors, MCP servers are already a must-have. “They can’t wait,” says Peter Nebel, chief strategy officer at cloud consultancy AllCloud. “If they wait, their competition will be there before them and have the MCP advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies that have already released official MCP servers for public use include PayPal, Notion, HubSpot, CloudFlare, Atlassian, Slack, and GitHub. There are also third-party providers building MCP servers. Zapier, for example, currently offers MCP connections to 8,000 different apps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a vendor doesn’t offer their own, official MCP server, someone else might set up unofficial ones that use the vendor’s APIs. For example, there are already MCP servers out there for LinkedIn, Spotify, eBay, YouTube, AWS, Zillow, and many other platforms, some more trustworthy than others. Developers and power users are downloading them and using them to give their AI agents access to those platforms, but it’s not always obvious where some of these less-than-official MCP servers are coming from, who’s maintaining them, and what else they do under the covers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pulse MCP &lt;a href="https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; over 6,000 servers. MCP marketplace MCP.so currently &lt;a href="https://mcp.so/"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; more than 16,000. And a GitHub search for “MCP server” produces more than 45,000 results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-an-mcp-security-platform"&gt;What to look for in an MCP security platform&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether a company connects their own agents to third-party MCP servers, their own MCP servers to third-party agents, or their own servers to their own agents, there’s going to be the potential for data leakage, prompt injections and other security threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means companies will need to check for authorizations and permissions, implement fine-grained access controls, and log everything, says AllCloud’s Nevel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are some other MCP security tools that vendors are offering today:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCP server detection&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s easy for company employees to download and run their own MCP servers. These servers could boost their productivity or they could be a new attack vector. Some MCP security vendors are offering scanning services to help companies find all instances of shadow MCP servers in their environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime protection&lt;/strong&gt;: AI agents communicate with MCP servers in plain English. That creates the potential for prompt injections, data leaks and other security issues. Many MCP security vendors offer tools to monitor all communications for these and similar problems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authentication and access controls&lt;/strong&gt;: The core MCP protocol now supports OAuth, but that’s just the start. For additional security, vendors offer zero trust and least privilege control frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging and observability&lt;/strong&gt;: Vendors can provide platforms to collect MCP logs, alert security teams about security events or policy violations, collect compliance data, or feed logs into existing security infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vedors-offering-mcp-security-tools"&gt;Vedors offering MCP security tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below, we divide in three sections the list of vendors offering MCP security tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="hyperscalers"&gt;Hyperscalers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For companies all-in on a particular cloud platform, going with the MCP tools provided by that particular hyperscaler can be an easy way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AWS launched its own agentic AI platform in July. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore includes a gateway that supports multiple protocols, including MCP, an identity management system and observability. In October, AWS followed this up with a set of guidelines for securing MCP servers with &lt;a href="https://builder.aws.com/content/33oERPjcEutnPmaud1BvlPRP9zR/security-guidelines-for-model-context-protocol-in-aws"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt; best practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced a basic Azure MCP server in April, added support for the Azure Key Vault in May, announced MCP support in the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service in June, and announced Azure API Management support in August. Azure API Management means that MCP servers can have secure and governed access to resources, with observability and control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, Microsoft announced the Microsoft Agent Framework, which includes support for both MCP and the Agent2Agent protocol, protection against prompt injection, PII detection, and multi-agent observability to ensure that the systems are doing what they’re supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud announced its MCP Toolbox for Databases in April with authentication and observability built in. In September, it released a reference architecture for securing MCP servers on the Google Cloud Platform, based around a centralized MCP proxy architecture. It uses the Google Identity Platform to validate identities and issue OAuth tokens, uses Model Armor to check messages for prompt injections, jailbreaks, or sensitive data, and a Secret Manager to store API keys, credentials, and sensitive configuration values. Its Artifact Registry can store MCP server images and scan them for vulnerabilities before they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google also recommends using network-level security controls to isolate MCP servers and reduce the risk of lateral movement. Finally, Google’s Security Command Center can identify unauthorized access and data exfiltration attempts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="major-technology-providers"&gt;Major technology providers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare: Cloudflare announced &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/zero-trust-mcp-server-portals/"&gt;MCP Server Portals&lt;/a&gt;, which enable enterprises to centralize, secure, and observe every MCP connection. This feature is part of Cloudflare One, the company’s secure access service edge (SASE) platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto Networks: The company launched the &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2025/06/securing-ai-agent-innovation-prisma-airs-mcp-server/"&gt;Prisma AIRS MCP Server&lt;/a&gt; in June. It sits between the AI agent and the MCP server and detects malicious content in data, helping protect against prompt injection attacks, as well as web and DNS attacks. Another tool, MCP Security in Cortex Cloud WAAS, sits at the network boundary, and inspects MCP communications for malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SentinelOne: &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/avoiding-mcp-mania-how-to-secure-the-next-frontier-of-ai/"&gt;SentinelOne Singularity Platform&lt;/a&gt; offers visibility into the MCP interaction chain, as well as alerts and automated incident response, for both local and remote MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VMware: In August, parent company Broadcom &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/4045708/vmware-explore-2025-broadcom-tackles-agentic-ai-security-challenges.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that VMware Cloud Foundation will offer more security for agentic workflows, including MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="startups"&gt;Startups&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acuvity: &lt;a href="https://acuvity.ai/"&gt;Acuvity&lt;/a&gt; secures MCP servers by hardening them with least-privilege execution, immutable runtimes, continuous vulnerability scanning, authentication, and threat detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akto: API security company Akto launched an &lt;a href="https://www.akto.io/mcp-security"&gt;MCP security&lt;/a&gt; solution in June, claiming to be the first dedicated security solution specifically built to protect MCP servers. It includes a discovery tool for finding the MCP servers deployed in corporate environments, security testing tools, and monitoring and threat detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Invariant Labs: Their &lt;a href="https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan"&gt;MCP-Scan&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source scanner that performs static analysis of MCP servers and does real-time monitoring to detect tool poisoning attacks, rug pulls, and prompt injection attacks. A commercial product, Invariant Guardrails, is a proxy that sits between AI agents and MCP servers and protects against project injections and other MCP security threats, and allows companies to impose rules such as prohibiting PII from going to external email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Javelin: The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.getjavelin.com/ai-security"&gt;AI Security Fabric platform&lt;/a&gt; includes MCP security, such as functionality to scan for risky servers, or to block or require review of agent tools or data requests. In addition, MCP guardrails stop unsafe calls and poisoned inputs in real-time and prevent prompt injections and data leakage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lasso Security: Open source &lt;a href="https://github.com/lasso-security/mcp-gateway"&gt;MCP gateway&lt;/a&gt; that allows configuration and lifecycle management of MCP servers and sanitizes sensitive information in MCP messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.mcptotal.io/"&gt;MCPTotal&lt;/a&gt;: Offers a hub to manage, run and monitor MCP servers in a secure, sandboxed environment, as well as a gateway to protect AI workflows interacting with both internal and external MCP servers, and a governance tool to monitor and enforce AI tool use policies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noma: Recently launched &lt;a href="https://noma.security/solutions/ai-agent-security/"&gt;AI Agent Security&lt;/a&gt; solution offers support for discovery of MCP connections, vulnerability scanning, access policy enforcement, real-time prompt guardrails, and audit trails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obot: The &lt;a href="https://obot.ai/"&gt;Obot MCP gateway&lt;/a&gt; is an open-source platform to manage MCP servers, define security access policies, and track usage and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Operant: Operant &lt;a href="https://www.operant.ai/solutions/mcp-gateway"&gt;MCP Gateway&lt;/a&gt; automatically catalogs MCP tools, discovers AI agents, and tracks traffic between agents and servers to eliminate MCP blind spots. It can also identify threat vectors such as tool poisoning, jailbreaks and unauthorized access, prevent data leaks, and establish a centralized governance framework for agents and tools across the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Solo: The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.solo.io/products/agentgateway-enterprise"&gt;Agent Gateway&lt;/a&gt; was overhauled in August to support MCP and A2A protocols and protects against malicious prompts and data leaks, enforces strong authentication, and centralizes logging and tracing for every interaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teleport: Its &lt;a href="https://goteleport.com/use-cases/secure-model-context-protocol/"&gt;Secure MCP&lt;/a&gt; tool for its Infrastructure Identity Platform allows companies to unify how they govern human, machine, workload, device, and AI identities. MCP Security provides identity, access control, governance, and audit tools in a zero trust and least privilege environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Rogue MCP servers can take over Cursor’s built-in browser</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089046/rogue-mcp-servers-can-take-over-cursors-built-in-browser.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI agents and coding copilots are shaking up how — and what — developers code. But they’re also rapidly expanding the attack surface of developer machines&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest example: Security researchers have shown how a rogue Model Context Protocol (MCP) server can inject malicious code into the built-in browser feature of Cursor, a popular AI-powered code editor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrate how a single malicious MCP server can replace login pages inside Cursor’s internal browser with an attacker-controlled page that harvests credentials and sends them to a remote attacker,” researchers from AI cybersecurity firm Knostic.ai wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.knostic.ai/blog/mcp-hijacked-cursor-browser"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; shared with CSO. “We also show how that same capability allows an attacker to fully compromise the victim’s workstation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally developed by Anthropic to facilitate communication between large language models (LLMs) and external data sources or applications to improve workflow context, MCP has become a key component for developing AI agents that automate tasks by leveraging external tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The protocol uses a client-server architecture, in which applications expose functionality to LLMs through an MCP server and AI agents or applications connect to those services through an MCP client. Integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code — and those based on it, like Cursor and Windsurf — natively support integration with MCP servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enhance security, most IDE vendors maintain repositories with vetted MCP servers, but IDE users can also deploy custom servers manually. Such servers can be found all over the internet, including GitHub. Earlier this year, researchers found hundreds of MCP servers in public GitHub repositories that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4012712/misconfigured-mcp-servers-expose-ai-agent-systems-to-compromise.html"&gt;had dangerous misconfigurations&lt;/a&gt;, including default exposure to untrusted networks and OS command injection paths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attacking-cursor-and-other-vs-code-based-ides"&gt;Attacking Cursor and other VS Code-based IDEs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cursor is essentially a fork of VS Code with code added to turn it into an AI-assisted coding tool, whereas VS Code gets its AI capabilities through extensions. Knostic researcher Dor Munis, who developed the MCP attack against Cursor, told CSO that unlike VS Code, which performs integrity checks of its own files, Cursor does not. As a result, any modification of its own code will not present the user with a warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VS Code, and by extension Cursor and other VS Code forks, is built on Electron, a framework used to develop cross-platform applications with Node.js and the Blink browser engine from Chrome. Because of this, these applications employ a JavaScript interpreter. As IDEs, they also have file system access and elevated permissions to perform tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knostic researchers recently published &lt;a href="https://www.knostic.ai/blog/demonstrating-code-injection-vscode-cursor"&gt;a proof-of-concept attack against Cursor implemented through a malicious extension&lt;/a&gt; that injected malicious JavaScript into the running IDE to execute actions and manipulate its user interface. Malicious extensions have also been found &lt;a href="http://csoonline.com/article/4072829/tigerjacks-malicious-vscode-extensions-mine-steal-and-stay-hidden.html"&gt;in the VSCode Marketplace and the OpenVSX registry&lt;/a&gt;, which Cursor also uses, including &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076718/self-propagating-worm-found-in-marketplaces-for-visual-studio-code-extensions-2.html"&gt;a self-propagating worm that harvests credentials&lt;/a&gt; from developer machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knostic’s newly unveiled attack is similar in concept, but delivered via a malicious MCP server, it expands the attack surface beyond extensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An MCP server should be treated exactly like VS Code extensions in terms of security,” Munis said. That’s because MCP servers are essentially downloaded to run on your computer, and inherit the permissions of the IDE you use, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his proof-of-concept attack, Munis shows that an MCP server can inject JavaScript code into &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/docs/agent/browser"&gt;the built-in browser&lt;/a&gt; that Cursor recently added to allow developers to visually test changes to their application code and to allow Cursor’s AI agent to automatically perform tasks that require browsing. Using this technique, Munis replaced the browser’s actively displayed page with a log-in prompt, like in a phishing scenario, but without the URL ever changing — in other words, injected code’s changes happen on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, the impact of such an attack would depend on what the victim is doing in the browser. Developers might be displaying sensitive data from the web app they’re working on, or they might be logged into a service. It’s worth noting that the internal browser saves authentication cookies for the session and those could also be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack was developed to prove successful JavaScript code injection via an MCP server, but just like with the extension attack, it could be expanded to perform other malicious actions inside the Cursor IDE itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defenses"&gt;Defenses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations must review and control, both through policy and access controls, the IDE extensions and MCP servers their developers use. They should do this just like they should be vetting application dependencies from package registries such as npm or PyPI to prevent the compromise of developer machines or inheriting vulnerabilities in their code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers are increasingly using VS Code extensions as an attack vector to target developers and it’s only a matter of time before they’ll start abusing MCP servers more widely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Try to find the project’s GitHub repo and review the code,” the Knostic team advised. “This is a program you install on your computer that can do anything. If there’s doubt about its credibility, DO NOT USE IT.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using auto-run modes, in which agents are allowed to perform tasks automatically inside the IDE without a human approving the steps, also known as YOLO mode, should also be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Never blindly enable anything, especially MCP functionality,” the team warned. “Don’t assume that everything your AI agent generated is as you expected. Read through the code before you perform actions in the embedded browser.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp#security-considerations"&gt;In its MCP documentation&lt;/a&gt;, Cursor itself warns developers to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify an MCP server’s source and only install from trusted developers and repositories&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check what data and APIs the server is supposed to access&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use API keys with restricted permissions&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Audit the server’s code for critical integrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>UK cybersecurity bill brings tougher rules for critical infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4088549/uk-cybersecurity-bill-brings-tougher-rules-for-critical-infrastructure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK government has introduced a new legislation to harden national cyber defenses across critical infrastructure, imposing turnover-based penalties and granting ministers emergency powers to intervene during major cyber incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, unveiled Tuesday, would require organizations in healthcare, energy, water, transport, and digital services to meet mandatory security standards and report significant cyber incidents within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Companies that fail to comply could face daily fines of up to $132,000 (£100,000) or penalties tied to annual turnover, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tough-new-laws-to-strengthen-the-uks-defences-against-cyber-attacks-on-nhs-transport-and-energy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bill, expected to receive Royal Assent in 2026, updates the UK’s Network and Information Systems Regulations (NIS) 2018, expanding coverage to include managed service providers (MSPs), data centers, and key suppliers for the first time. It supports the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/missions" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Plan for Change&lt;/a&gt; strategy aimed at strengthening national resilience while driving economic growth, the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="turnover-linked-penalties-and-a-behavioural-shift"&gt;Turnover-linked penalties and a behavioural shift&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bill marks a turning point in how the UK enforces cybersecurity compliance. “The penalties change behaviour in a way flat fines never could,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research. “For large operators, every breach now carries a cost proportionate to their market reach. That link between impact and liability forces investment before the incident, not after it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation introduced significantly tougher enforcement powers than those found in the EU’s NIS2 Directive or GDPR, said Madelein van der Hout, senior analyst at Forrester. “The bill sets a precedent for stricter cybersecurity enforcement by combining turnover-based penalties with emergency government powers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proposal followed a series of damaging cyber incidents that exposed vulnerabilities in UK infrastructure. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2099498/suspected-chinese-hack-of-britains-ministry-of-defence-payroll-linked-to-government-contractor-minister-confirms.html"&gt;hackers compromised&lt;/a&gt; a Ministry of Defence payroll system via a contractor, exposing data of 270,000 armed services members. The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2138778/london-hospitals-face-days-of-disruption-after-ransomware-attack-on-supply-chain-partner.html"&gt;Synnovis ransomware attack&lt;/a&gt; on an NHS pathology provider disrupted more than 11,000 medical appointments, costing roughly $43 million (£32.7 million). The British Library breach in late 2023 caused losses of up to $9 million (£7 million), and recent attacks on Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and Jaguar Land Rover have renewed pressure on policymakers to act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An independent &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-research-on-the-economic-impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-the-uk"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; cited by DSIT estimated that cyberattacks cost the UK economy about $19.4 billion (£14.7 billion) each year or about 0.5% of the GDP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msps-and-data-centers-under-scrutiny"&gt;MSPs and data centers under scrutiny&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time, medium and large managed service providers (MSPs) would fall within the scope of cybersecurity regulation. They must report significant incidents promptly to both government and customers, maintain detailed response plans, and demonstrate readiness to handle cascading impacts, the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hout said the new framework will “reshape the MSP sector,” creating stronger detection and faster response cycles. “For enterprise clients, it promises earlier alerts and greater assurance that their providers adhere to minimum security standards.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bill’s 24-hour reporting mandate will pressure MSPs and digital service providers to upgrade operations. “Many organisations will find their processes too slow and fragmented to meet that clock,” Gogia warned. Shivraj Borade, senior analyst at Everest Group, added that the rule will prompt MSPs to “invest in SOC maturity, rapid triage, and legal alignment,” which will fundamentally alter pricing and client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislation also shifted accountability between enterprises and their service partners. “For the first time, we place more responsibility with the MSSP where it normally lies with the enterprise,” said Hout. “It raises expectations for both parties: MSSPs will carry greater legal accountability, and enterprises must perform tighter due diligence.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the bill, data centers will also come under direct regulatory oversight for the first time, joining a broader group of operators responsible for managing power flow to smart devices and electric vehicle chargers. Organizations in scope must notify regulators and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) within 24 hours of a significant cyber incident and submit a full report within 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="emergency-powers-and-expanded-oversight"&gt;Emergency powers and expanded oversight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, the technology secretary would gain authority to direct regulators and organizations, including NHS trusts and utilities, to take “specific, proportionate steps” to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks where national security is threatened. These interventions could include enhanced monitoring or temporary network isolation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The emergency powers recognize that cyber incidents evolve faster than committees can respond,” Gogia said. “Allowing the government to instruct critical sectors during live threats makes the system capable of acting in minutes, not weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regulators would also be empowered to designate critical suppliers, such as diagnostics providers or chemical manufacturers, to ensure they meet baseline cybersecurity standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Agentic AI opens door to new ID challenges: Report</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4089682/agentic-ai-opens-door-to-new-id-challenges-report.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research released Thursday by Rubrik Zero Labs finds that the AI wave, and in particular agentic AI, has created a “troubling gap between the expanding identity attack surface and organizations’ ability to recover from resulting compromises.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the report, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://zerolabs.rubrik.com/reports/the-identity-crisis" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Identity Crisis: Understanding &amp;amp; Building Resilience Against Identity-Driven Threats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the result is a surge of both non-human identities (NHIs) and agentic identities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key findings revealed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;89% of organizations have “fully or partially incorporated AI agents into their identity infrastructure, and an additional 10% have plans to.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Of those polled, 58% estimate that, in the next 12 months, half or more of the cyberattacks they must deal with will be “driven by agentic AI.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Industry &lt;a href="https://www.cyberark.com/press/machine-identities-outnumber-humans-by-more-than-80-to-1-new-report-exposes-the-exponential-threats-of-fragmented-identity-security/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; contend that NHIs now outnumber human users by 82-1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, a &lt;a href="https://www.rubrik.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/25/new-rubrik-research-finds-identity-resilience-is-imperative-as-ai-wave-floods-the-workplace-with-ai-agents" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from Rubrik states, as organizations integrate agents into their workflows, the increase in NHIs will continue to outpace the growth of human identities,  and securing them “will become as essential — if not more so — as securing human identities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, authors of the report state, “as traditional network boundaries have dissolved amid cloud migrations, remote work adoption, and now agentic AI, identity is no longer merely a control layer. It has become the primary attack surface, which threat actors weaponize to gain access to IT environments and ‘live off of the land’ over the course of an attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of today’s breaches, they write, are predicated on exploiting trust and valid credentials rather than circumventing network defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;‘Under-the-radar crisis exists&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kmariappan" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kavitha Mariappan&lt;/a&gt;, chief transformation officer at Rubrik, said, “the rise of identity-driven attacks is changing the face of cyber defense. Managing identities in the era of AI has become a complex endeavor, especially with the labyrinth of NHIs. We have an under-the-radar crisis on our hands where a single compromised credential can grant full access to an organization’s most sensitive data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “comprehensive Identity Resilience is absolutely critical to cyber recovery in this new landscape.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was prompted, she said in an email to &lt;em&gt;CSOonline,&lt;/em&gt; because “the cyber defense landscape has fundamentally changed, creating a significant gap between the expanding identity attack surface and an organization’s ability to recover [from an attack]. As traditional network boundaries have dissolved due to cloud migration, remote work, and the accelerating adoption of agentic AI, identity has become a primary vulnerability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors “are overwhelmingly exploiting trusted and valid credentials to &lt;em&gt;log&lt;/em&gt; in, not break in,” Mariappan explained. “These attacks are further complicated by the labyrinth of non-human identities, like API keys and AI agents, which are surging across the enterprise and are proving difficult to manage. Unlike with human identities, these NHIs can be difficult to revoke and often slip through the cracks, leading to poor lifecycle governance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, head of Canadian security awareness training provider firm Beauceron Security, said he agrees with the report’s findings for a key reason: “[While] phishing and social engineering overall are where attacks start, identity and access management (IAM) practices are where the fire gets roaring.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations, he said, “need modern approaches to IAM and employee cyber education and engagement. The employee education doesn’t just help them spot and stop threats, you can help them understand why good IAM processing technology is required.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed out, “[there is] a reason why &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/648894/identity-based-security-threats-are-growing-rapidly-report.html?utm=hybrid_search" target="_blank"&gt;identity and access management&lt;/a&gt; is the foundation of a security program. When it’s done poorly, the impacts reverberate throughout an organization during an attack.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shipley said that he often tells clients, “IAM is the bottom of the cyber equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Maslow’s hierarchy of needs&lt;/a&gt;. Where humans need food and shelter to survive, digital systems need strong IAM practices to survive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In our work around the world, we’ve seen that as organizations get larger and more complex, it’s far more likely they have huge issues in identity management,” he said. “This isn’t the kind of problem that technology alone can fix, regardless of the vendor. It takes understanding people, process, culture, and technology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="agentic-ai-like-a-stick-of-dynamite-thrown-into-a-fishpond"&gt;Agentic AI ‘like a stick of dynamite thrown into a fishpond’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, said Shipley, “it doesn’t matter what AI-powered IAM tool you have if you allow people to bypass processes to grant, remove, or change access because the process for approvals is [seen] as too slow or cumbersome.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The least favourite thing to find when you’re investigating a cyber incident, he said, “is no way to trace who did what because there’s nothing in the logs. The second worst is to find a bunch of identities that no one knows how they got there or how they had the access they did.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shipley described agentic AI as “basically a stick of dynamite thrown into a fishpond when it comes to identity, and the results look the same. If organizations can’t tell if a human or their agent performed a set of actions, they can’t properly understand if they have a software vulnerability, an issue with employee awareness or motivation on security, or even worse, an insider threat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, he said, “the whole concept of zero trust just got wiped out. Agents rely on huge amounts of trust and frankly, they haven’t earned it and have done everything they can possibly do to show they shouldn’t be trusted. From hallucinations to hijacking, this technology is not ready for prime time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/thomas-randall" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Randall&lt;/a&gt;, research lead at Info-Tech Research Group, added that most of the Rubrik Zero Labs report “validates what the industry already knows. For years, Info-Tech research has shown that identity is a prime attack surface, that zero trust/least privilege/continuous verification are best practices, and that security training is imperative.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attack-surface-to-drastically-increase"&gt;Attack surface to drastically increase&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said that two elements stood out to him: “First is bridging human and non-human identity under a single umbrella; typically, we might understand these under separate domains of IAM vs DevOps secrets management, respectively. The report’s point is that attackers don’t respect those org-chart boundaries, so security teams should think beyond those boundaries, too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, said Randall, “this framing overlooks that these identities are operationally different. While both authenticate and authorize, the tooling, telemetry, RACI, and risk models differ. A single ‘identity plane’ may be the goal conceptually, but practically, it’s hard to implement across those divergent ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second element is, he said, “the stark claim that non-human identities now outnumber human users by around 82:1. As organizations start developing more AI agents (especially if individuals have free rein to develop their own copilots or GPTs), the attack surface drastically increases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Randall noted, “each copilot or GPT can hold API keys, OAuth tokens, or delegated permissions (for example, ‘read SharePoint docs, query CRM data, send emails.’). This is certainly where I think organizations need to be concerned: the gap between agentic AI rollout and AI governance grows increasingly wider.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations, he said, “have to be disciplined in controlling agent creation, credentialing, and lifecycle management; otherwise, the attack surface potentially increases drastically.” Security leaders must understand that IAM tools alone won’t protect against or help them restore the integrity of their identity infrastructure in the event of a compromise, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, said Mariappan, they must also understand that IAM tools alone won’t protect against or help them restore the integrity of their identity infrastructure in the event of a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, she said, “while 87% of IT and security leaders plan to change their IAM providers, 60% have already switched providers in the last three years, signaling the industry’s dissatisfaction with current solutions for tackling identity-based threats. Our research reveals that a comprehensive identity resilience strategy is needed for when, not if, an attack strikes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
