      <title>24 industrial-scale labs dismantled in the largest-ever operation against synthetic drugs</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/24-industrial-scale-labs-dismantled-in-largest-ever-operation-against-synthetic-drugs</link>
      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>Das nächste große Security-Schlachtfeld</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4122039/das-nachste-grose-security-schlachtfeld.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quantum Screen 16z9" class="wp-image-4122048" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gorodenkoff_shutterstock_2615909831_16z9.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wenn Quantum Computing und KI in der Praxis zusammenkommen, bricht ein neues Zeitalter an – auch und vor allem in Sachen Cybersecurity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Gorodenkoff | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In den letzten Jahren hat künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ihre Tentakel über die globale Technologielandschaft &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4030328/so-verandert-ki-ihre-grc-strategie.html" target="_blank"&gt;ausgebreitet&lt;/a&gt;. Das verdeutlicht unter anderem auch der zunehmende Einsatz von Automatisierung und autonomen Technologien in diversen Branchen und Sektoren. Und während die Welt noch mit dem Impact der KI ringt, steht mit Quantencomputing bereits das “next big thing” in den Startlöchern. Das Aufeinandertreffen dieser beiden Technologien verspricht, der nächste große technologische Schauplatz zu werden. Dieser könnte nicht nur Computing und Cybersicherheit, sondern sogar geopolitische Machtstrukturen entscheidend prägen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Denn während KI-Algorithmen dafür bekannt sind, Muster zu erkennen und aus den ihnen zugeführten Daten zu lernen, versprechen &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4121972/davos-abwarten-ist-beim-quanten-computing-keine-option.html" target="_blank"&gt;Quantencomputer&lt;/a&gt;, mehrere Wege gleichzeitig zu erkunden. Das legt nahe, dass mit der Technologie eine Revolution in Sachen Datenverarbeitung bevorsteht. Anstelle von Bits (0en und 1en), wie sie von KI-Systemen verwendet werden, nutzen Quantencomputer Qubits, die dank der Prinzipien der Superposition und Verschränkung gleichzeitig in mehreren Zuständen existieren können. So verspricht ein gut konzipiertes Quantensystem, Probleme in Mikrosekunden zu lösen, für die konventionelle Computer Jahre benötigen würden. Das könnte beispielsweise dazu beitragen, künftig manipulationssichere Kommunikationsinfrastrukturen zu etablieren – Stichwort Quantum Key Distribution (&lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/quantum-networking-technologies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QKD&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-trifft-quantum-computing-ein-zweischneidiges-schwert"&gt;KI trifft Quantum Computing – ein zweischneidiges Schwert&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Je mehr Daten in einen KI-Algorithmus einfließen, desto besser sind im Regelfall die Ergebnisse. Besonders großangelegte KI-Systeme wie ChatGPT oder DeepMind AlphaFold haben jedoch regelmäßig mit den Grenzen zu kämpfen, die ihre zugrundeliegende Hardware aufwirft. Mit Quantencomputern würden sich diese Limitationen in Luft auflösen: Sie nutzen Quantum Machine Learning (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01146" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;QML&lt;/a&gt;), um etwa Muster zu erkennen oder Simulationen zu optimieren. Darüber hinaus macht das Konzept des QML-Trainings es sehr wahrscheinlich auch überflüssig, Echtzeit-Trainingsdaten über riesige Rechenzentren bereitzustellen. In der Praxis wird die Kapazität von Quantencomputern Ergebnisse in Mikrosekunden liefern. Das macht etwa globale Echtzeit-Klimasysteme und Real-Time-Finanzmarktsimulationen möglich.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doch die schöne neue Quanten-Zukunft hat auch eine dunkle Seite: Schließlich kann die Technologie auch von Cyberkriminellen als Waffe instrumentalisiert werden. Mit den resultierenden, quantengestützten Cyberbedrohungen könnten aktuelle &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2650080/faq-was-sie-ueber-verschluesselung-wissen-sollten.html" target="_blank"&gt;Verschlüsselungsverfahren&lt;/a&gt; wie ECC, RSA oder AES ausgehebelt werden – wobei die beiden erstgenannten etwa von Finanzinstituten genutzt werden, um Online-Transaktionen abzusichern. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Würden diese Encryption-Methoden kompromittiert, wäre die Vertraulichkeit verschlüsselter Daten passé. Der Tag, an dem es dazu kommt, bezeichnet man auch als „&lt;a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/07/01/pqc-standardization/"&gt;Q-Day&lt;/a&gt;“. Und es lauern noch weitere, quantengestützte Gefahren. So könnten Cyberkriminelle die Technologie etwa auch einsetzen, um:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passwörter zu knacken,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;digitale Zertifikate zu fälschen, oder&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Deepfakes von KI-Systemen zu erstellen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="der-weg-in-die-quanten-zukunft"&gt;Der Weg in die Quanten-Zukunft&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sowohl Unternehmen als auch Regierungsinstitutionen, bereiten sich bereits auf den Q-Day vor. Das britische National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) verfolgt etwa einen stufenweisen Ansatz, um bis zum Jahr 2035 sämtliche seiner Systeme entsprechend zu härten. In den USA soll die Umstellung der nationalen Sicherheitssysteme ähnlich laufen – hier ist 2030 das Ziel. Diese Bemühungen sind ein proaktiver Verteidigungsansatz, der darauf fokussiert, &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;quantenresistente Verschlüsselungsmodelle&lt;/a&gt; und adaptive Cybersicherheitsrichtlinien zu entwickeln, die die Sicherheit kryptografischer Schlüssel im nahenden Quantenzeitalter gewährleisten können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weil auch Quanten-Systeme auf Wahrscheinlichkeiten basieren und nicht auf Gewissheiten, besteht die Herausforderung für diejenigen, die diese Innovationen entwickeln, nicht nur darin, die schnellsten und effizientesten Kombinationsmöglichkeiten von KI- und Quantensystemen aufzutun. Es geht dabei auch und insbesondere um das Thema Trust. Dieses Vertrauen müsste in Form von Cybersecurity Frameworks und -Regulierungen aufgebaut werden, die die Sicherheit, Transparenz und Governance optimieren. Das kann auch dazu beitragen, die Themenfelder Post-Quanten-Kryptografie, KI-Audits, Observability und Ethik anzugehen, die die Grundlage für widerstandsfähige digitale Ökosysteme bilden werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch wenn KI und Quantencomputing die menschliche Intelligenz nicht ersetzen werden, werden ihre Spuren in nicht allzu ferner Zukunft überall zu sehen sein. Die eigentliche Frage ist dabei jedoch, ob sich unsere Gesellschaft an das Tempo dieser technologischen Entwicklungen anpassen kann – bevor sie von ihr beherrscht wird. Trotz aller positiven Aussichten ist die Gefahr groß, dass die Kombination aus Quantum Computing und KI die Grundlagen des digitalen Vertrauens und der Privatsphäre, auf denen moderne Gesellschaften beruhen, untergraben. Und angesichts des immer näher rückenden Q-Day steigt auch die Dringlichkeit, sich auf die Post-Quanten-Welt vorzubereiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für Unternehmen, Regierungen und Cybersicherheitsexperten heißt das in erster Linie, über die Innovation und den technologischen Fortschritt, den die Technologien mit sich bringen, hinauszublicken und die Resilienz in den Fokus zu nehmen. Das wird massive Investitionen erfordern, um ethische KI-Governance, Regulierungsrahmen und Vorschriften sowie Post-Quanten-Kryptografie-Standards in bestehenden Systemen zu fördern.

      <title>When responsible disclosure becomes unpaid labor</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4124766/when-responsible-disclosure-becomes-unpaid-labor.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Responsible disclosure is built on an assumption that “doing the right thing” will be met with timely action, fair treatment, and professional respect, if not a bounty award. Increasingly, that assumption is failing. And when it does, organizations alienate researchers and create regulatory, legal, and reputational risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, security researchers have found themselves waiting months, sometimes more than a year, for companies to acknowledge responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities, even as the same flaws quietly put customers at risk. In several cases, frustration over silence, disputed severity assessments, or shifting scope boundaries pushed researchers toward public disclosure, legal escalation, or questionable behavior companies later characterized as extortion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As vulnerability reporting becomes slower, more bureaucratic, and less rewarding, the line between cooperative research and adversarial pressure is blurring. For CISOs, this is no longer an ethics debate. It is a governance and risk-management problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A recent flashpoint&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most recently, the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109221/react2shell-is-the-log4j-moment-for-front-end-development-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182)&lt;/a&gt; illustrated how responsible disclosure can work when the right structures are in place. The flaw was privately reported to the React maintainers on 29 November 2025. The disclosure triggered a coordinated response involving the React team, Next.js maintainers at Vercel, and major cloud providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cloudflare, allowing patches to be developed and tested ahead of public disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the prompt acknowledgment and remediation efforts, the vulnerability was quickly &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101890/warning-react2shell-vulnerability-already-being-exploited-by-threat-actors.html" target="_blank"&gt;exploited in the wild&lt;/a&gt;. Responsibility for mitigation was effectively distributed across maintainers, framework integrators, and downstream users. Because React sits at the core of the modern web stack, the flaw rippled across development and security teams globally, highlighting how even well-handled disclosures can still produce widespread operational risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;React benefits from strong institutional support through the &lt;a href="https://expo.dev/blog/the-react-foundation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;React Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and backing from multiple large technology companies. That support enables coordinated fixes, communication, and sustained maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more difficult question is what happens when a researcher uncovers a similarly critical flaw in a widely used open-source project that has no corporate backing, no formal security team, and no bounty program?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In those cases, exploitation is clearly unethical, but reporting the issue often means unpaid labor with uncertain outcomes. The dilemma raised in practitioner circles after React2Shell was not about this specific incident, but about the broader incentive gap. If responsible disclosure offers neither compensation nor assurance of timely action, what realistically motivates researchers to continue doing the right thing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question resonated not because it’s new, but rather that it reflects a growing disconnect between how vulnerability disclosure is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to function and how it increasingly does in practice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Enter the gray zone of ethical disclosure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a growing gray zone between ethical research and adversarial pressure. Based on years of reporting on disclosure disputes, that gray zone tends to emerge through a small set of recurring failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent treatment and severity warfare: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers submit detailed reports and receive no response for months, or face disputes over CVE scope and CVSS scoring that turn technical discussions into negotiations. Researchers feel compelled to defend impact claims aggressively and to be taken seriously, while vendors push back against what they &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-rejects-cve-severity-makes-his-github-repo-read-only/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;view as inflated risk&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, bounty hunters preemptively elevate severity, anticipating resistance and delays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process as denial of service:&lt;/strong&gt; Automated scanners, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567053/what-is-ai-fuzzing-and-why-it-may-be-the-next-big-cybersecurity-threat.html" target="_blank"&gt;AI-assisted fuzzing&lt;/a&gt;, and largely theoretical bugs increasingly flood maintainers and security teams with low-signal reports — a dynamic &lt;a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;repeatedly highlighted&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Stenberg, the founder of the cURL project. As a defensive response, maintainers demand ever more concrete proof of exploitability, raising the threshold for engagement even for legitimate findings. In some cases, projects &lt;a href="https://lists.haxx.se/pipermail/daniel/2026-January/000143.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;begin questioning&lt;/a&gt; whether bug bounties meaningfully improve security, or simply externalize triage cost under the guise of incentives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coercive escalation: &lt;/strong&gt;Finally, when established disclosure channels appear unresponsive or dismissive, some researchers resort to public pressure, legal threats, or ethically ambiguous demonstrations to force action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of these failure modes seems rational in isolation. Together, they erode trust and steadily push responsible disclosure toward a more adversarial posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Case studies from the fault line&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2025, a responsibly reported email spoofing flaw affecting a major delivery platform was &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doordash-email-spoofing-vulnerability-sparks-messy-disclosure-dispute/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deemed out of scope&lt;/a&gt;, triggering a dispute over severity and impact. The underlying issue was not whether the bug existed, but whether it crossed the organization’s internal threshold defining risk. The disclosure process stalled, and frustration escalated on both sides, with the vulnerability reporter barred from the bug bounty program over advances the company saw as extortion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar &lt;a href="https://x.com/Ax_Sharma/status/1477655101883957249" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pattern appeared&lt;/a&gt; at a ride hailing company, where multiple researchers independently reported a flaw that allowed emails to be sent appearing to originate from the company’s domain. Despite clear reproduction steps and repeated follow-ups, the reports went unanswered for more than a year. Ethical disclosure was met not with remediation, but with silence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, disputes have emerged over overlapping CVE claims, with multiple &lt;a href="https://x.com/FuzzingLabs/status/1977720899114606745" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;parties arguing &lt;/a&gt;over &lt;a href="https://x.com/gecko_sec/status/1977805927320551672" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attribution&lt;/a&gt; for the same underlying issue. What is meant to be a coordination mechanism instead became a contest for recognition, further distorting narratives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More troubling are cases where researchers crossed ethical boundaries entirely. For example, hijacking open-source libraries to harvest cloud credentials, or taking control of legitimate packages to &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researcher-hijacks-popular-packagist-php-packages-to-get-a-job/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;embed&lt;/a&gt; job application messages, compromising downstream users in the process. Such actions are indefensible but are best understood as symptoms of a disclosure ecosystem that increasingly rewards escalation, visibility, or leverage over patience and cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why is this happening now?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to frame these disputes as a breakdown in professional norms, but what is happening beneath the surface is the convergence of several structural forces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability report volume has surged. Automated scanners and AI-driven fuzzing tools now generate vast numbers of technically valid but operationally irrelevant findings. Maintainers and security teams are forced to triage at scale, often under significant time and resource constraints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, compliance pressures have hardened organizational responses. Once a CVE is reported, it is often treated as a problem by default, before context or exploitability is assessed. High severity scores can trigger build failures, audits, or executive escalation regardless of practical impact — a common frustration for developers using &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571621/software-composition-analysis-explained-and-how-it-identifies-open-source-software-risks.html" target="_blank"&gt;SCA tools&lt;/a&gt; that block builds over edge cases that ultimately need to be ignored or waived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CVSS scoring itself is mechanically calculated and intentionally environment-agnostic, meaning low-impact edge cases can score similarly to actively exploited flaws, contributing to alert fatigue and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, open source infrastructure remains &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/18/open_source_maintainers_underpaid/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;structurally underfunded&lt;/a&gt;. Many critical components are maintained by a small number of individuals with no obligation, or capacity, to absorb the operational cost imposed by global dependency chains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this environment, demanding proof of real-world impact is a form of noise control, rather than hostility. That seemingly reasonable demand, however, has downstream consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When proof becomes unpaid consulting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many disputes, disclosure breaks down not because a vulnerability does not exist, but because proving its real-world impact requires environment-specific analysis that neither side budgeted for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are asked to build realistic PoCs, demonstrate exploit chains, or validate assumptions across configurations they do not control. Maintainers are asked to reason about downstream usage patterns far beyond their original design scope. Both are performing system-level analysis without compensation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maintainers are justified in pushing back against low-signal reports. Researchers are justified in feeling that the bar for engagement keeps rising. The system offers no obvious place to send the cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why should CISOs care and what can they do?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For cybersecurity leaders, the implications are concrete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When disclosure channels are perceived as slow, dismissive, or adversarial, researchers disengage. Some go quiet. Others escalate publicly. A few take ethically questionable paths. None of these outcomes improve security posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, most of the levers that determine these outcomes sit with software vendors, platform providers, and open-source stewards. In those environments, CISOs oversee product security incident response teams (PSIRTs), vulnerability intake, disclosure timelines, and researcher engagement. This is where incentives are set, researcher experience is shaped, and triage decisions determine whether cooperation compounds or collapses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs operating in vendor, platform, and open-source environments, there is no single fix. Outcomes improve materially when disclosure is treated as an operational function rather than a moral expectation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Practical steps that CISOs in this space can take include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish and honor service-level expectations for acknowledgement and triage, even when fixes take time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Assign clear ownership for the researcher experience, not just vulnerability intake.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Publish severity triage criteria and document rationale when disagreeing with reports.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid treating CVSS scores as deployment gates without environmental context.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use third-party disclosure programs or coordinators to absorb overflow and reduce friction.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Offer meaningful non-cash recognition where bounties are not feasible.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Commit to upstreaming fixes when patching dependencies internally.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Provide legal safe harbor language for good faith testing to reduce adversarial escalation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fund the open-source dependencies your organization relies on, whether through sponsorship, contracts, or consortiums.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be explicit about what level of proof is expected and what isn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of these steps require endorsing exploit sales or paying ransoms for vulnerabilities. They require acknowledging that ethical behavior does not scale on goodwill alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For CISOs in healthcare, finance, education, and other consuming organizations, the risk manifests differently but no less acutely. When disclosure breaks down upstream, it surfaces downstream as delayed patches, brittle compensating controls, and security decisions driven by incomplete or distorted signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left unaddressed, those gaps can become governance failures. Organizations may be unable to explain why known vulnerabilities remained unpatched, why risk signals were discounted, or why vendor assurances were accepted without scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise CISOs influence this system through procurement requirements, vendor accountability, and how rigorously vulnerability data is contextualized before triggering disruption. Treating disclosure quality as a third-party risk factor is no longer optional.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>CSO Barry Hensley on staying a step ahead of the cyber threat landscape</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101470/a-desire-to-protect-his-nation-made-barry-hensley-seek-a-career-in-cybersecurity-after-24-years-of-military-service.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IT security was a critical element of retired US Col. Barry Hensley’s 24-year military career as an Army Signal Officer, as he was often responsible for the engineering and installation of “military networks, whether in garrison or in support of combat troops deployed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The pinnacle of my military career was working with an elite group of cyber forces with the ultimate mission to operate and defend the military’s global communications network,” Hensley tells CSO. “It was during this period that I realized the severity of cybersecurity issues facing this [US] nation, and I wanted to commit my professional career to be part of the solution while continuing to fight the good fight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, Hensley is the CSO of Brown &amp;amp; Brown, a global insurance brokerage, with the goal to help clients safeguard what matters most to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSO spoke to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barry-hensley/"&gt;Barry Hensley&lt;/a&gt; about cybersecurity in the insurance industry, how to keep cyber professionals inspired, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do organizations today perceive cybersecurity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hensley:&lt;/strong&gt; The awareness of cybersecurity risks is more consistent across industry today; but the degree of required call to action often varies greatly. Cybersecurity is foundational to any organization, especially where customer confidence and trust are essential. And part of that trust includes the security of the networks, the data, and the services we provide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was not that long ago that organizations did not believe the risks were real or relevant to them. Times have changed as more organizations have either experienced a significant incident firsthand or have seen enough third- and fourth-party breach notifications to take up arms. All these events drive awareness and give credibility to the threats and associated risks. However, there is still a challenge in establishing an appropriate risk tolerance that drives the right investments in effective security controls, especially for budget constrained organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also cannot forget the rise of government intervention and fines and other regulatory actions related to cybersecurity events that will influence those perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What specific security risks are you facing in the insurance industry today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors today have a common theme, and that’s how they capitalize on their access. So, personally, I do not over-index on the vertical specific threats; it’s really about the data or access those organizations possess and its perceived value. Specific to the insurance industry, there may be information collected to inform a claim or policy that a threat actor might determine valuable even if it only refines their targeting efforts of others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, we also cannot wish away the “idealist” or “ideologically motivated” threat actors that target the insurance industry because of historical misconceptions or animosity toward the industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specific to ransomware, threat actors are likely to target organizations that have a high likelihood of paying or be exploited. So, it’s as much about the data those organizations possess, not necessarily the industry verticals themselves, and the maturity of their security program. Threat actors want to expend the least number of resources for the highest return on investment, so they often target low-hanging fruit, which are, in many cases, the least mature security programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see your cybersecurity strategy changing in the next few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our strategy remains the same: focused security investments aligned to our risk tolerance, staying a step ahead of an increasingly active threat landscape. An example is the adoption of artificial intelligence hacking tools, clearly an illustration of the need to adapt. The question is, How do our security teams combat this advancement with our own AI strategy? How do we leverage AI to carry out those commodity tasks while unleashing our human teammates to focus on business context as it relates to the overall risk reduction and prioritization of training those AI models?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, imagine an AI security workforce that is led by human security subject-matter experts ensuring we have appropriate defenses at the right time and right place. An example would be conducting continuous penetration testing to find the gaps in our defenses that might otherwise go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We do see the evolution of third- and fourth-party risk management, especially in how we validate our security partner’s maturity and resilience. The evolution of risk is partly based on third and fourth parties swapping their underlying technologies to reduce cost or increase efficiencies that a customer has little to no understanding of the risks that might expose. So, for the security functions we’re going to provide internally, we’ll focus on the basics and do them well. With the controls/functions we outsource, we must reimagine not only how we &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4119475/13-cyber-questions-to-better-vet-it-vendors-and-reduce-third-party-risk.html"&gt;verify our partner environments&lt;/a&gt; but how do we actively participate to improve their security programs as well as ours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We cannot forget that much of cybersecurity is about doing the basics brilliantly. And in this case, those basics of building and securing an infrastructure that will still be leveraged for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do to retain cybersecurity professionals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadership is about how you inspire people to achieve or accomplish a shared vision beyond what they ever expected they could do. Leaders must first understand teammates’ passions and relevant skills to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080670/what-does-aligning-security-to-the-business-really-mean.html"&gt;align them to achieve business goals&lt;/a&gt;. Getting their buy-in is key while clearly articulating where they fit in the overall vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Brown &amp;amp; Brown, we help others protect what is most valuable to them. To retain our top talent, we make sure our teammates understand where they fit into that mission. Our success story is based upon earning people’s business every day, and ensuring that our environment, networks, and data are secure is critical to building and retaining that trust. We need to demonstrate to our teammates just how integral they are to maintaining that trust in our customer relationships. We want them to wake up every day knowing that they play an important role not only in our security program, but also the broader Brown &amp;amp; Brown ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Brown &amp;amp; Brown, we put the teammate first, as their expertise will always be a key differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you most proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am most proud of the inspiring team of security professionals that I work with each day. They always put the team before themselves, strive to be the very best at what they do, and always go the extra mile to ensure the security and protection of their teammates and the organization. I am truly blessed to be part of an amazing team whose work ethic and commitment to excellence are unparalleled in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any questions CISOs should be asking themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Are we assessing the most relevant risks, rather than the risks of yesterday? And, because we can get so wrapped up in the playbook that we ran in our last organization, how do we ensure the current playbook is relevant to the organization at hand? An example would be how much time we focus on phishing training, which burdens our teammates to be the first line of defense, where we could instead leverage anomaly-based detection to automate the detection and response actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest security challenges cybersecurity leaders are facing right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hensley: &lt;/strong&gt;In this business, there is no single biggest challenge, but multiple, ever-evolving challenges that compete for our attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A shared challenge across the entire cybersecurity community is having to be right 100% of the time in a world where threat actors are so agile, innovative, well-resourced, and advantaged with the element of surprise. Cybersecurity professionals also struggle with prioritizing their efforts while providing innovative solutions for their enterprises. Every cybersecurity leader must wrestle with the risks posed by new technologies; AI being just one of many.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is no absolute “right” answer to the risk question, the age-old formula of mitigating threats against your most critical assets holds firm. Security teams have an ongoing mission to identify weaknesses, assess the likelihood of exploitation, and determine the resulting impact on the business. It’s a difficult but necessary step in the risk versus reward trade-off&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What keeps you up at night?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hensley:&lt;/strong&gt; The unknown. As I shared above, cybersecurity professionals must be right 100% of the time, while threat actors only need to exploit one unknown or unmitigated vulnerability, or take advantage of a single user with privileged access. Our risk modeling should invest in effective security controls to minimize the unknown threats as much as possible against our most critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Why non-human identities are your biggest security blind spot in 2026</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4125156/why-non-human-identities-are-your-biggest-security-blind-spot-in-2026.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, while running a routine access audit on our Azure environment, I came across a service account called svc-dataloader-poc. It had not been touched in 793 days — two years of sitting dormant. When I checked its permissions, my stomach dropped: Owner-level access to three production subscriptions, including our customer database. The account had been spun up for a proof-of-concept migration that never went live. The contractor who created it left 18 months ago. Nobody knew it existed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was not a one-off. I found 47 similar accounts in that same audit. Forty-seven doors left wide open.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here is the uncomfortable reality facing every security leader in 2026: while we spent the last decade perfecting MFA rollouts and zero-trust architectures for our human users, something else was quietly multiplying across our environments. Service accounts. API keys. Automation credentials. AI agents. These non-human identities now outnumber actual employees in most enterprises by ratios that would have seemed absurd five years ago. &lt;a href="https://www.manageengine.com/privileged-access-management/identity-security-outlook-report.html"&gt;ManageEngine’s 2026 Identity Security Outlook&lt;/a&gt; found that organisations reported machine-to-human ratios of 100:1; some hit 500:1. And the vast majority of these identities sit completely outside our governance programmes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We locked the front door. The back door has been open this whole time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-the-nhi-explosion-is-different-this-time"&gt;Why the NHI explosion is different this time&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Machine identities are not new. What changed is the velocity. Five years ago, a typical enterprise application was a monolith talking to a database. Today, that same application is 50 microservices, each needing credentials to talk to the others. Every Kubernetes pod that spins up during auto-scaling creates workload identities. Every GitHub Actions workflow generates tokens. Every Terraform run provisions service principals. I watched a single deployment pipeline create more machine identities in 20 minutes than our entire company had human users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then came agentic AI, and the problem accelerated again. These are not chatbots answering questions. They are systems authorised to execute commands, move production data, modify configurations and trigger downstream workflows autonomously. Microsoft Copilot has access to your SharePoint. GitHub Copilot can commit to your repos. The AI assistant your marketing team just deployed can pull customer records from Salesforce. One Identity is predicting 2026 will see the first major breach traced back to an over-privileged AI agent. The terrifying part? It will not look like an attack. It will look exactly like the system doing what it was designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our IAM systems were never built for this. They assume identities belong to people with managers who respond to access review emails and eventually resign or retire. Machine identities have no manager. They never respond to certification campaigns. They do not quit. The &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-non-human-identities-top-10/"&gt;OWASP Non-Human Identities Top 10&lt;/a&gt; ranks improper offboarding as the number one risk. When a project gets cancelled, when a vendor integration gets deprecated, when a developer leaves — does anyone remember to delete the service accounts? In my experience running IAM programmes across multiple organisations, the answer is almost never.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-three-blind-spots-i-keep-finding"&gt;The three blind spots I keep finding&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After years working in cloud security and identity management, certain patterns show up everywhere I look. Three problems in particular appear in nearly every environment I assess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets where they should never be. &lt;/strong&gt;I still find API keys hardcoded in source files. Still. In 2026. Last year, GitGuardian detected 13 million secrets exposed in public GitHub repositories. Google API keys, MongoDB credentials, AWS access keys — sitting in plaintext for anyone to harvest. But the public repos are not even the biggest problem. In my own assessments, I have found production database passwords in Jira tickets, Slack messages, Confluence runbooks and shared Google Docs. A colleague once discovered an admin token for a payment gateway pasted into a Teams chat from 2023, still valid, still granting full access. Once secrets escape into collaboration tools, you have lost control. They get copied, forwarded, indexed, archived. They never truly disappear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service accounts with absurd privilege levels. &lt;/strong&gt;This one makes me angry because it is so preventable. A developer needs a service account for a new Lambda function. They are under deadline pressure. Figuring out the exact minimum permissions takes time, so they attach AdministratorAccess and move on. The function works. Nobody revisits it. That account now has god-mode access to your entire AWS environment for a task that needed read access to one S3 bucket. Multiply this across every team, every sprint, every year. The &lt;a href="https://nhimg.org/2025-state-of-non-human-identities-and-secrets-in-cybersecurity"&gt;2025 State of Non-Human Identities report&lt;/a&gt; from Entro Security found 97% of NHIs have excessive privileges. Ninety-seven percent. Even more alarming: just 0.01% of machine identities control 80% of cloud resources. Compromise one of those accounts and the attacker owns your environment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No lifecycle ownership whatsoever. &lt;/strong&gt;When an employee leaves, HR triggers offboarding. Access gets revoked. There is a process. When a service account is no longer needed, what happens? Nothing. It sits there. I routinely find accounts untouched for six months, twelve months, sometimes three years — all still holding production access. Veza’s research found dormant accounts nearly doubled year over year. Orphaned identities grew 40%. Former employees — 78,000 of them in one dataset — still had active credentials because HR systems flagged them as inactive but nobody revoked their service accounts. These are not theoretical vulnerabilities. These are live credentials waiting for someone to find them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-practical-path-forward-for-security-leaders"&gt;A practical path forward for security leaders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the problem is step one. Fixing it requires treating machine identities with the same governance discipline we finally learned to apply to human users. Based on what I have seen actually work, here is where I would focus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a real inventory. &lt;/strong&gt;You cannot protect what you cannot see. Before anything else, discover every non-human identity in your environment. Every service account across your cloud platforms. Every API key in your applications. Every secret in your vaults, config files, CI/CD pipelines. Every third-party integration with access to your systems. Most organisations I work with drastically underestimate their footprint. The actual number is typically three to five times what teams expect. This cannot be a manual exercise or an annual audit. Identities are created faster than humans can count them. Automate discovery and make it continuous.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforce least privilege without exceptions. &lt;/strong&gt;Every NHI needs to be scoped to the minimum access required for its function. Yes, this takes work. Yes, developers will push back. Do it anyway. Start with new deployments and make least privilege the default from day one. For existing accounts, compare assigned permissions against actual usage patterns. You will find plenty of accounts with broad access that only ever touch one or two resources. Those are quick wins. Require security approval before any NHI gets elevated privileges. Make it a gate, not a suggestion.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate static credentials wherever possible. &lt;/strong&gt;Long-lived secrets are the root cause behind most NHI breaches. The goal should be eliminating them entirely. Replace permanent API keys with short-lived tokens that expire automatically. Implement just-in-time access that grants permissions for a specific task and revokes them immediately after. Automate credential rotation on a defined schedule — weekly, daily, even hourly for sensitive systems. Research shows 71% of non-human identities are not rotated within recommended timeframes. Every day a credential sits unchanged is another day an attacker could be using it without detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security industry is converging on a clear consensus for 2026: machine identities will become the primary breach vector in cloud environments. Tenable predicts it. Delinea predicts it. One Identity predicts it. Attackers already know that compromising a service account is often easier and quieter than targeting humans. They are not breaking down doors anymore. They are walking through the ones we forgot to lock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The organisations that get ahead of this threat will be the ones treating their non-human identities with the same seriousness they apply to their executive accounts. Full visibility. Strict governance. No exceptions. The ones who keep treating NHIs as an afterthought will be the ones explaining to their boards how a forgotten service account from a cancelled project brought down the house.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We locked the front door years ago. It has been a long time since we secured the back.&lt;/p&gt;
