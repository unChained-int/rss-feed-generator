      <description>Fake toys are poisoning, deafening and injuring children across Europe, while causing major losses to the EU economy. 26 countries, coordinated by Europol, co-led by France, Spain and Romania, and supported by the EUIPO and OLAF, have once again led initiatives to take down the producers and importers of counterfeit toys. With the global toy market valued at up to EUR 300 billion annually, it also remains the second-most counterfeited industry globally.</description>

      <title>Coupang breach of 33.7 million accounts allegedly involved engineer insider</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101486/coupang-leaks-personal-information-of-33-7-million-accounts-suspected-of-poor-authentication-key-management.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A prolonged lack of management of valid authentication keys for signed access tokens issued to authenticators is believed to be the root cause of over 30 million accounts being exposed externally by ecommerce giant Coupang. Ongoing analysis suggests that these keys could have been exploited even after the responsible employee left the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 29, Coupang &lt;a href="https://news.coupang.com/archives/58849/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming the unauthorized exposure of personal information from approximately 4,500 accounts on Nov. 18. The company also noted that the breach had been reported to the National Police Agency, the Korea Internet &amp;amp; Security Agency, and the Personal Information Protection Commission. Subsequent investigations, however, revealed that the damage involved approximately 33.7 million accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaked information included names, email addresses, shipping address lists, and some order information. Coupang stated that payment information, credit card numbers, and login information were not included. It is believed that unauthorized access occurred via overseas servers starting on June 24, 2025. The company also stated that it is currently cooperating with relevant authorities to investigate the cause of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msit.go.kr/bbs/view.do?sCode=user&amp;amp;mPid=208&amp;amp;mId=307&amp;amp;bbsSeqNo=94&amp;amp;nttSeqNo=3186554" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Ministry of Science and ICT, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, and other relevant agencies conducted&lt;/a&gt; an on-site investigation after receiving a report of a breach on Nov. 19 and a report of a personal information leak on Nov. 20. The investigation confirmed that the attacker exploited an authentication vulnerability in Coupang’s servers, bypassing the normal login process and leaking customer information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government launched a joint public-private investigation team on Nov. 30, and the Personal Information Protection Commission is investigating whether Coupang violated its personal information protection safety measures — access control, access authority management, encryption, etc. As a service with such a high user base that it’s often called the “Amazon of Korea,” Coupang issued a public security notice on Nov. 29 to prevent secondary damage. Furthermore, a three-month period, starting Nov. 30, will be dedicated to strengthening the monitoring of personal information leaks and illegal distribution online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Choi Min-hee, Chairwoman of the National Assembly Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee, released the results of an analysis of the specific causes of the incident in a press release on Nov. 30. According to information received from Coupang, the company reportedly responded that “the token signing key validity period is often set to 5 to 10 years,” adding that “the rotation period is long and varies greatly depending on the key type.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chairman Choi’s side explained this incident using an analogy to an access control system. If the “token” required for login is a single-use access card, the “signature key” is like the authentication stamp used to issue the access card. While access is impossible without the authentication stamp, even with the access card, if the signature key is left unattended for an extended period, it can be subject to continued exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Rep. Choi Min-hee’s office, Coupang’s login system is designed to immediately discard tokens after they are created, but the signature information required for token creation was deleted or not updated when the employee in charge left the company, and was thus exploited by internal employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a press release, Chairman Choi Min-hee stated, “Coupang did not follow the most basic internal security procedure of renewing the signing key,” and “Abandoning a long-term valid authentication key was not simply a deviation by an internal employee, but the result of organizational and structural problems at Coupang that neglected the authentication system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Victims of this breach have been notified via email or text message. Related information can also be found on a separate &lt;a href="https://mc.coupang.com/ssr/desktop/faqlist" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;information page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coupang CEO Park Dae-joon &lt;a href="https://news.coupang.com/archives/58857/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issued a separate statement&lt;/a&gt; on Nov. 30, saying, “We sincerely apologize for causing great inconvenience and concern to the public,” and “Coupang will do its best to prevent further damage by closely cooperating with the joint public-private investigation team including the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Personal Information Protection Commission, the Korea Internet &amp;amp; Security Agency, and the National Police Agency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Korean President Lee Jae Myung this week referenced the data breach at Coupang in &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/south-koreas-lee-calls-tougher-penalties-after-coupang-data-breach-2025-12-02/"&gt;calling for increased penalties for corporate negligence&lt;/a&gt; in such scenarios. The breach is believed to be the worst in South Korea in over a decade. Bloomberg reports that the breach may be a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-03/coupang-breach-is-poised-to-be-a-landmark-case-for-south-korea"&gt;landmark case for South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It could result in a record fine, &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251204006900315"&gt;potentially up to 1.2 trillion won (US$814M)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10629826"&gt;prime suspect is a former Coupang engineer&lt;/a&gt; who had worked on authentication systems. The police are investigating whether the former employee acted alone or collaborated with others on the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Vaillant CISO: NIS2 complexity and lack of clarity endanger its mission</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101952/vaillant-ciso-start-instead-of-waiting.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSO Germany: The energy sector is increasingly becoming a target for cybercriminals. Experts and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) believe that protection in this area must be significantly increased. How do you assess the current situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; The geopolitical tensions we are currently witnessing are leading to an increased threat level. This naturally also affects the heating industry, in which Vaillant operates and which fulfills everyone’s basic need for warmth and hot water at home. Such sectors absolutely must be better protected. The problem is that the attacks are becoming increasingly targeted and complex. These days, we’re no longer dealing with less experienced script kiddies working in their basements, but rather with well-organized and professional cybercriminals. Their goal is to harm the company or the economy of the respective country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence within companies has lowered the barrier to entry for attacks on businesses and supply chains than ever before. This makes it easier, for example, to create targeted phishing emails or develop malware, which previously required significantly more effort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you reacting to the changed situation? How are you currently protecting your company from cyberattacks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; We pursue a holistic approach to information security. This means we examine every aspect from top to bottom and rely on a multilayered security concept. This includes both preventative and reactive security measures to enable us to react quickly and effectively in an emergency. We are aware, however, that no company can guarantee absolute security. Therefore, everyone should plan with the assumption that a successful attack is always possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We prioritize the security of not only our internal IT infrastructure, but also our global production and products for our customers. Protecting our end customers and adhering to high security standards are our top priorities — especially given the growing threat of ransomware attacks. Our focus is on proactively minimizing risks and ensuring long-term trust in our solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the employees?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; Cybersecurity begins with people. Thanks to Vaillant’s global network, we clearly focus on this when it comes to security. Through our holistic four-pillar approach, we rely on comprehensive awareness training for our entire workforce, from gamification approaches to practical compliance training. We also address topics from the private sphere, such as phishing examples from some telecommunications companies or parcel delivery services, to increase relevance and promote sustainable learning processes&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges are currently causing the most problems for CISOs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; First of all, the role of the CISO has fundamentally changed in recent years. Previously, the focus was primarily on technical aspects and operational security. Today, strategic alignment and leadership skills are key qualifications. A modern CISO must not only manage technological risks but also act as a sparring partner for management, assess business risks, and embed information security as an integral part of the corporate strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the biggest challenges currently lie in implementing new legal requirements such as NIS2, DORA, and the Cyber ​​Resilience Act. I describe the whole thing as a regulatory jungle that first needs to be understood. We are operating in a complex regulatory environment that must be interpreted pragmatically and implemented with the right resources. Ultimately, it’s not just about ensuring compliance, but about increasing the security level throughout the entire company to create greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we have too many safety rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; In the heating industry, the regulatory requirements are manageable, even though NIS2 and others are relevant. I generally welcome uniform standards, as they increase safety in Germany and Europe. The challenge lies in national implementation: Each country interprets the regulations differently, which creates considerable complexity for internationally operating companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The legislators behind NIS2 have failed to develop uniform and pragmatic security rules for implementation across Europe. While NIS2 was adopted at the EU level, it must be transposed into the local legislation of each country. This means that each country contributes its own interpretation. Organizations operating across Europe must therefore consider all relevant legislation in their respective regions. Ensuring a standardized procedure in this context adds further complexity and requires significant coordination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are so many companies still struggling with implementation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reiß:&lt;/strong&gt; Often, the interpretation of the regulations lacks clarity. Many companies — especially SMEs — don’t know if they even fall within their scope. Added to this are questions about resource allocation: Should implementation be done internally or with external partners? Who assumes responsibility — IT, the compliance department, or a dedicated security team? Furthermore, there is often a lack of maturity and awareness regarding where and how cybersecurity needs to be strategically embedded so that such topics can be implemented appropriately. These factors hamper progress and cost companies crucial time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to regulations. I recommend that companies analyze their current situation, define initial steps, and get started. My motto is: Start, don’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3568794/nis2s-cybersecurity-value-spreads-beyond-its-expanded-scope.html"&gt;NIS2’s cybersecurity value spreads beyond its expanded scope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think offensive security is a place we need to get to, because [we] can use the information obtained from it to fine-tune the security program and controls,” Madden says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Madden is not alone in her desire to add an offensive program to advance her cybersecurity strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprise security’s remit is defensive in nature: to protect and defend the company’s systems, data, reputation, customers, and employees. But CISOs like Madden have been increasingly adding offensive components to their strategies, seeing attack simulations as a way to gain valuable information about their technology environments, defense postures, and the weaknesses hackers would find if they attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a growing percentage of CISOs see offensive security as a must-have and, as such, are building up offensive capabilities and integrating them into their security processes to ensure the information revealed during offensive exercises leads to improvements in their overall security posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s super important to have time and resources dedicated to [using] threat intelligence and conducting tabletop exercises and getting to the point where you have purple teaming,” Madden says, “because you don’t want to always be on your heels.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="components-of-offensive-security"&gt;Components of offensive security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offensive security, or OffSec for short, is the practice of using attacker-style tactics to find and fix vulnerabilities in an organization’s own IT environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/people/dan-mellen"&gt;Dan Mellen&lt;/a&gt;, global and US cyber CTO at professional services firm EY, defines it as the organization’s “identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities before adversaries do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mellen sees several buckets of activities involved in offensive security, starting with vulnerability management at the bottom end of the maturity scale, and then moving up to attack service management and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571697/penetration-testing-explained-how-ethical-hackers-simulate-attacks.html"&gt;penetration testing&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/569703/threat-hunting-explained-taking-an-active-approach-to-defense.html"&gt;threat hunting&lt;/a&gt; and adversarial simulations, such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Then there’s the concept of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4083612/the-soc-parachute-needs-more-than-packing-it-needs-practice.html"&gt;purple teaming&lt;/a&gt; where the organization looks at an attack scenario and what were the defenses that should have alerted but didn’t and how to rectify those,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other offensive security components include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red teaming&lt;/strong&gt;, where ethical hackers simulate real-world attacks to test detection and response capabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3618336/top-tips-for-cisos-running-red-teams.html"&gt;Red teams aim to emulate threat actors&lt;/a&gt; by using stealthy tactics to bypass controls and achieve objectives such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversary emulation&lt;/strong&gt;, where security pros re-create known threat actor &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3497597/5-best-practices-for-running-a-successful-threat-informed-defense-in-cybersecurity.html"&gt;tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)&lt;/a&gt; based on threat intelligence to validate defensive tools and train incident response teams under real-world conditions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social engineering assessments&lt;/strong&gt;, which test humans and processes through phishing, pretexting, and other manipulation techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It’s similar to the way pen testing tests technology systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security tool evasion testing&lt;/strong&gt;, which tests how well an organization’s security technologies detect and block evasive techniques such as obfuscation, encryption, or living-off-the-land tactics, and tests whether those security technologies can be bypassed via malicious techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of these offensive security components — namely vulnerability management, pen testing, and phishing — have been longstanding elements of most enterprise security programs. For example, 88% of security leaders consider pen testing to be a “vital component of their organization’s overall security efforts,” according to the &lt;a href="https://resource.cobalt.io/ciso-perspectives-report"&gt;2025 CISO Perspectives Report&lt;/a&gt; from cybersecurity software maker Cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many CISOs also have had team members with specific offensive security skills for many years. In fact, the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), the Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP), and the Offensive Security Certified Expert (OSCE) certifications from &lt;a href="https://www.offsec.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OffSec&lt;/a&gt; are all credentials that have been in demand for years. Of late, the field of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3957786/top-16-offsec-pen-testing-and-ethical-hacking-certifications.html"&gt;OffSec, pen testing, and ethical hacking certifications&lt;/a&gt; has grown considerably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offensive security technologies are not new, either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, experts say advancements in vendor products thanks to the addition of automation, analytics, and artificial intelligence have increased the effectiveness of offensive security programs while also lowering the barrier of entry for security teams to add OffSec to their operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a lot of tech providers bring capabilities to market to support this proactive, or offensive, approach,” Mellen says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-to-offsec-operations"&gt;Challenges to OffSec operations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, many security departments have yet to adopt a comprehensive offensive security program — with small and midsize companies being the most likely to have little to no OffSec elements, Mellen says, adding that limited resources — budget, staff, skills — create a common barrier to implementing or maturing offensive security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another factor that keeps CISOs from incorporating more offensive security into their strategies is concern about exposing vulnerabilities they don’t have the ability to address, Mellen adds. “They can’t unknow that they have those vulnerabilities if they’re not able to do something about them, although the hackers are going to find them whether or not you identify them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, Mellen and others contend that it’s critical for CISOs to implement and expand OffSec measures now as hackers increasingly leverage AI to launch more targeted and more sophisticated attacks at a faster clip. To counteract hackers’ growing capabilities, experts say CISOs must become faster in identifying and closing security gaps — which is exactly what OffSec enables CISOs to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Offensive security is more important than it was before, because threat actors are using AI-enabled tools to develop attacks we haven’t experienced before. Back when hackers were using script kiddies, attacks were fairly predictable,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/acardwell/"&gt;Aimee Cardwell&lt;/a&gt;, CISO in residence at tech company Transcend and former CISO of UnitedHealth Group. “Now hacks are so esoteric, they’re almost hard to understand. And if you’re only relying on scanning, you’re not catching potential vulnerabilities early enough or at all. You need to continuously be looking for them through offensive security.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-business-case-for-offsec"&gt;The business case for OffSec&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mellen says CISOs can use the information gleaned from their offensive security programs to create business cases for additional investments in the security program. “That data-driven evidence can go a long way to quantifying risk and quantifying the effort and cost to remediation,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billdunnion/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Bill Dunnion&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of telecommunications company Mitel, sees a strong case for adopting more offensive security measures in his own organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, offensive security is to think like the bad guys. I have to think, ‘What would I do? How would I get in? Can I find those back doors and windows that have been left open?’ so I can find them and fix them,” he says. “What you don’t know in the world of security can kill you, so what offensive security does for me is that it helps me identify the unknowns. And once I know something is there, I can mitigate it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dunnion already has some OffSec components in his cyber strategy, including vulnerability management, pen testing, and threat hunting, but wants to expand such capabilities. For example, he wants to create a formal threat hunting program rather than doing threat hunting on an ad hoc basis — as his team does now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkarsh121/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Utkarsh Choudhary&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of IT security at Deloitte Canada, is another proponent of adopting more OffSec elements, seeing it as “sending out scouts and testing out walls and fences to see if those controls really work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is more systematic and a continuous approach of validating,” he adds, noting that offensive security has become an essential element because of the increasing complexity of today’s enterprise IT environment and the typical organization’s ever-expanding attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choudhary also points out that many OffSec components, such as pen testing, are required by business partners and clients, and by certain regulations and frameworks such as ISO 270001.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like others, Choudhary says OffSec practices help organizations better understand their risks. “It provides you an empirical assessment and forces honesty in the organization,” he says. “It validates what you’re doing well and what you’re not doing well. It proves to the organization if something isn’t sufficient. It gives you a true proof of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To maximize the value, however, Choudhary and others say organizations must move beyond &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; OffSec components to &lt;em&gt;integrating&lt;/em&gt; their offensive program with their defensive one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Offense doesn’t displace defense; it strengthens what defense has been missing. Offense enhances the defense posture,” Choudhary says. “Offensive security adds a security layer to defense, so it’s not either, or even both, but that they have to work in concert. And that makes the organization more proactive rather than reactive, because it lessens the opportunities for hackers to get in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>KI schafft neue Sicherheitsrisiken für OT-Netzwerke</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4102407/ki-schafft-neue-sicherheitsrisiken-fur-ot-netzwerke.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="AI" class="wp-image-4102420" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2471192567.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Sicherheitsbehörden sehen in der vermehrten Nutzung von KI eine Gefahr für die Sicherheit von OT-Systemen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Durch bigjom jom – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495110/ot-sicherheit-im-hinblick-auf-nis2.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sicherheit der Betriebstechnik (Operational Technology – OT)&lt;/a&gt; in kritischen Infrastrukturen ist seit Jahren ein immer wiederkehrendes Thema. Nach Ansicht von Sicherheitsorganisationen könnte die vermehrte Nutzung von KI in der OT die Lage noch verschlimmern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die US-Cybersicherheitsbehörde CISA hat deshalb vor kurzem gemeinsam mit internationalen Partnerbehörden Handlungsempfehlungen zur sicheren Integration künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) in Operational Technology(OT) kritischer Infrastrukturen (&lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/03/2003834257/-1/-1/0/JOINT_GUIDANCE_PRINCIPLES_FOR_THE_SECURE_INTEGRATION_OF_AI_IN_OT.PDF" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) herausgegeben.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Da der Einsatz von KI in kritischen OT-Infrastrukturen noch in den Kinderschuhen steckt, lesen sich die Leitlinien wie ein Versuch, Missbrauch und Fehlanwendungen zuvorzukommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im OT-Bereich wird KI derzeit primär in den Sektoren Energie, Wasseraufbereitung, Gesundheitswesen und Fertigung eingesetzt. Der Grund ist der gleiche wie an anderen Stellen: Um Prozesse zu optimieren sowie automatisieren und damit Effizienz und Verfügbarkeit zu verbessern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicherheitsbehörden befürchten, dass Unternehmen sich auf eine neue und noch nicht ausgereifte Technologie einlassen, ohne deren Grenzen zu bewerten, ähnlich wie es in der IT geschehen ist. Unter Berücksichtigung der Risiken für industrielle Steuerungssysteme (Industrial Control Systems – ICS) gemäß der &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Enterprise_Reference_Architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Purdue-Modellhierarchie&lt;/a&gt; werden in den Leitlinien Bedenken wie Prompt Injektion, Datenvergiftung und Datenerfassung aufgezählt. Zudem wird auf „KI-Drift” hingewiesen, bei dem Modelle weniger genau werden, wenn neue Daten von den Trainingsdaten abweichen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Autoren befürchten zudem, dass KI möglicherweise nicht die erforderlichen Hinweise liefert, um Fehler zu diagnostizieren. Darüber hinaus sei es schwierig, die Compliance-Anforderungen zu erfüllen, da sich KI rasch weiterentwickelt, so die Behörden. Zusätzlich weist das Paper darauf hin, dass es zu einem De-Skilling-Effekt beim Menschen kommt, verursacht durch eine schleichende Überabhängigkeit von KI. Ebenso könnten KI-Warnmeldungen zu Ablenkung und kognitiver Überlastung bei den Mitarbeitern führen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schließlich lässt die Tendenz von KI-Technologien wie Chatbots und LLMs zu Halluzinationen Zweifel daran aufkommen, ob die Technologie robust genug ist, um in Umgebungen eingesetzt zu werden, in denen Sicherheit oberste Priorität hat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„KI ist möglicherweise nicht zuverlässig genug, um in industriellen Umgebungen eigenständig kritische Entscheidungen zu treffen. Daher sollte KI wie LLM mit ziemlicher Sicherheit nicht für Security-Entscheidungen in OT-Umgebungen verwendet werden“, so die Autoren der Leitlinien.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dies unterstreicht einen wichtigen Unterschied zwischen der Verwendung von KI in einer OT- und einer IT-Umgebung: OT-Netzwerke sind von Natur aus sicherheitskritisch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="schwierigkeiten-bei-der-entflechtung"&gt;Schwierigkeiten bei der Entflechtung&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Die Leitlinien werfen die richtigen Fragen auf: Welche Risiken gehen wir ein, welchen Wert bringt KI wirklich, wer ist für die Aufsicht verantwortlich und wie reagieren wir, wenn die Technologie versagt?“, kommentiert Sam Maesschalck, OT-Ingenieur bei der Cybersicherheits-Schulungsplattform Immersive Labs. „Wir haben bereits gesehen, was passiert, wenn operative Anforderungen das sichere Design übersteigen. Die IT/OT-Konvergenz brachte Effizienz, aber sie legte auch OT-Netzwerke in einer Weise offen, mit der die Branche immer noch zu kämpfen hat.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Maesschalck würde die Einbindung von KI-Systemen in die OT-Infrastruktur scheitern, wenn nicht zuerst bereits bestehende Probleme gelöst werden. Dazu gehören die Unfähigkeit einiger OT-Geräte, die erforderlichen Datenmengen an KI-Plattformen zu liefern, und das Fehlen von Bestandsaufnahmen, die die Vorhersage von Probleminteraktionen erschweren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zu den Empfehlungen der Leitlinien gehört, dass Organisationen die &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide"&gt;Sicherheitsdesign-Grundsätze&lt;/a&gt; der CISA übernehmen und prüfen sollten, ob die interne Entwicklung eines KI-OT-Projekts ihnen langfristig mehr Kontrolle über das KI-Design und die KI-Implementierung verschaffen würde.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Diese Art von Leitlinien ist einflussreich, weil Betreiber nach Klarheit suchen. Durch staatlich unterstützte Grundsätze, auf die sie sich beziehen können, haben Eigentümer und Ingenieure etwas Konkretes, worauf sie sich berufen können, wenn sie sich gegen eine unsichere oder übereilte Einführung wehren. Außerdem wird dadurch die Bedeutung von Aufklärung unterstrichen“, so Maesschalck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Leitlinien folgen auf den &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3545051/make-ot-networks-a-priority-say-nine-national-security-agencies.html" target="_blank"&gt;Bericht der NSA und des ACSC&lt;/a&gt; aus dem letzten Jahr, in dem die Schritte aufgeführt sind, die Unternehmen zur Sicherung der OT in kritischen Infrastrukturen durchführen sollten. In keinem der beiden Dokumente wird jedoch auf die &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3856334/zu-wenig-budget-fur-ot-security.html" target="_blank"&gt;anhaltenden Bedenken eingegangen, dass die OT-Sicherheit immer noch nicht das Budget erhält, das sie verdient&lt;/a&gt;. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
