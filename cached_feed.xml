&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have long relied on firewalls, routers, VPN servers, and email gateways to protect their networks from attacks. Increasingly, however, these network edge devices are becoming security liabilities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every few weeks, another crisis plays out: Security teams scramble to patch and scan their network appliances for malware implants after another zero-day attack is newly reported. Vendors emphasize that sophisticated nation-state actors carry out these attacks, but critics question why the basic flaws being exploited — buffer overflows, command injections, SQL injections — remain prevalent in mission-critical codebases maintained by companies whose core business is cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers constantly evolve their techniques. Security engineering, inherently challenging, can’t fix everything. All software products have vulnerabilities, even security tools. These would be valid responses if we were dealing with complex flaws, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-harris-sg/"&gt;Benjamin Harris&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of cybersecurity and penetration testing firm watchTowr. “But these are vulnerability classes from the 1990s, and security controls to prevent or identify them have existed for a long time. There is really no excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="network-edge-devices-the-new-battleground"&gt;Network edge devices: The new battleground&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Google’s Threat Intelligence Group &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3973769/enterprise-specific-zero-day-exploits-on-the-rise-google-warns.html"&gt;tracked 75 exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly one in three targeted network and security appliances, a strikingly high rate given the range of IT systems attackers could choose to exploit. That trend has continued this year, with similar numbers in the first 10 months of 2025, targeting vendors such as Citrix NetScaler, Ivanti, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, SonicWall, and Juniper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Network edge devices are attractive targets because they are remotely accessible, fall outside endpoint protection monitoring, contain privileged credentials for lateral movement, and are not integrated into centralized logging solutions. Yet researchers have reported vulnerabilities in these systems for over a decade with little attacker interest beyond isolated incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That shifted over the past few years with a rapid surge in attacks, making compromised network edge devices one of the top initial access vectors into enterprise networks for state-affiliated cyberespionage groups and ransomware gangs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this shift, as organizations rapidly expanded remote access capabilities by deploying more VPN gateways, firewalls, and secure web and email gateways to accommodate work-from-home mandates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The declining success rate of phishing is another factor. Once the top initial access vector, phishing has become less effective thanks to defense efforts over the past 10 years. For 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3970097/the-state-of-intrusions-stolen-credentials-and-perimeter-exploits-on-the-rise-as-phishing-wanes.html"&gt;Mandiant reported that 33% of intrusions resulted from exploits&lt;/a&gt;, 16% from stolen or weak credentials, and only 14% from phishing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Attackers are not trying to do the newest and greatest thing every single day,” watchTowr’s Harris explains. “They will do what works at scale. And we’ve now just seen that phishing has become objectively too expensive or too unsuccessful at scale to justify the time investment in deploying mailing infrastructure, getting domains and sender protocols in place, finding ways to bypass EDR, AV, sandboxes, mail filters, etc. It is now easier to find a 1990s-tier vulnerability in a border device where EDR typically isn’t deployed, exploit that, and then pivot from there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that attack campaigns against network-edge devices are becoming more visible to security teams because they are looking into what’s happening on these appliances more than they did in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ten years ago, I was professionally doing exploit development for these types of routers,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-baines-1490a7189/"&gt;Jacob Baines&lt;/a&gt;, CTO and head of research at vulnerability intelligence company VulnCheck, tells CSO. “I know there were many groups that were interested in it, but the security industry itself was more interested in desktop endpoints. And I think the industry has gotten better at protecting those types of endpoints. They’ve gotten better at protecting against phishing, so this is the next area that we’re trying to improve upon. So, there are a lot more eyes on it from the security field, but not necessarily attackers. I think they’ve always been there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="basic-flaws-persist-in-network-device-codebases"&gt;Basic flaws persist in network device codebases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harris of watchTowr doesn’t want to minimize the engineering effort it takes to build a secure system. But he feels many of the vulnerabilities discovered in the past two years should have been caught with automatic code analysis tools or code reviews, given how basic they have been.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some VPN flaws were “trivial to the point of embarrassing for the vendor,” he says, while even the complex ones should have been caught by any organization seriously investing in product security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, despite the basic nature of some of these vulnerabilities, most do not directly allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands on the underlying OS with root privileges. Instead, attackers often must find and chain together vulnerabilities across multiple components, requiring them to understand how those components interact and identify a path to remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t necessarily call them complex exploit chains, but I think it’s a little unfair to call them simple as well,” VulnCheck’s Baines says. “Something like a Cisco ASA router or a PAN-OS system are very complicated systems. It takes a lot of knowledge of those systems to be able to write code in them and identify bugs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bishopfox.com/authors/caleb-gross"&gt;Caleb Gross&lt;/a&gt;, director of capability development at offensive security firm Bishop Fox, also notes the reverse-engineering skill required to find these bugs, as firmware images for these devices aren’t readily available, like open-source applications, and their file systems are often encrypted. Even after decryption, researchers or attackers must then learn how various components communicate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identifying a command injection that is looking for a command string being passed to a system in some C or C++ code is not a terribly difficult thing to find,” Gross says. “But I think the trouble is understanding a really complicated appliance like these security network appliances. It’s not just like a single web application and that’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This can also make it difficult for product developers themselves to understand the risks of a feature they add on one component if they don’t have a full understanding of the entire product architecture. In large product organizations, it’s not unusual for different development teams to handle different codebases for different parts of one product’s system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Harris offers a counterargument: The product security team only has to recognize a code bug with potential security implications and fix it. They don’t have to develop a working exploit, like an attacker does.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a product security team, your job is not really exploitation, like getting a shell,” he says. “Your aim is to work out how many of these vulnerabilities that you identify are exploitable. Can you remove the low-hanging fruit — the things that are trivial that someone is going to find — and then you can invest your efforts in finding more and more complex things.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harris adds: “In our opinion, again, looking at what we’ve seen the last 12 months, there’s no evidence that those efforts being made by those vendors are having an effect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-debt-and-prioritization-challenges"&gt;Security debt and prioritization challenges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another problem? These appliances have a lot of legacy code, some that is 10 years or older. Plus, products and code bases inherited through acquisitions often means the developers who originally wrote the code might be long gone. For example, Ivanti, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3954735/ivanti-warns-customers-of-new-critical-flaw-exploited-in-the-wild.html"&gt;more frequently targeted vendors&lt;/a&gt; over the past two years, acquired Pulse Secure in 2020, and the Pulse Connect Secure SSL VPN has since become &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3652369/ivanti-warns-critical-rce-flaw-in-connect-secure-exploited-as-zero-day.html"&gt;Ivanti Connect Secure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.veracode.com/leadership/chris-wysopal/"&gt;Chris Wysopal&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder and chief security evangelist at application security testing company Veracode, tackling vulnerabilities in old code, known as security debt, is expensive and hard. And developers are more reluctant to fix certain issues, particularly those in C and C++ code, such as buffer and integer overflows, due to concern that they might break something they don’t fully understand how it works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a modern process of application security testing and flaws are detected soon after code is written, the developer can go in and fix it,” Wysopal says. “But when you’re dealing with legacy code — we’ve actually seen some C++ applications where you have literally thousands of overflow issues and the original developers are long gone — it’s very difficult to get a new developer to look at it, and they don’t really want to touch the code. They get to a point where it’s like: Well, prove to me it’s exploitable, because this is a critical old piece of code that no one understands and it’s dangerous to touch it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, some flaws require more proof of impact than others, and proving that a buffer overflow can result in arbitrary code execution is not straightforward; it requires also bypassing exploit mitigations on the OS, such as ASLR, which randomizes memory addresses. Command injection issues, on the other hand, are much easier to fix, according to Wysopal, even in old code bases. Then authorization bypasses usually require manual penetration testing to find.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Each one of these flaw categories is a little different and this is why application security is hard,” he says. “But these are all top 10 issues. Things that these organizations should have a plan to say, ‘We’re going to eliminate the top 10 classes of vulnerabilities in our product.’ And it’s frankly just expensive and hard to do when you have big legacy code bases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vendors-need-to-set-a-higher-standard-for-themselves"&gt;Vendors need to set a higher standard for themselves&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All researchers interviewed for this story agree that manufacturers of security appliances need to do a better job when it comes to their secure development lifecycle programs, internal application security testing, code reviews, and legacy code rewrites. Some, however, don’t have much hope for things to change because financial incentives to do so are missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rewriting old code to be secure by design requires a lot of development time. Even fixing all the bugs that static and dynamic scanners find can incur budgetary challenges, resulting in the need to prioritize some over others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But security vendors need to be held to a higher standard because they sell products marketed to protect banks, government agencies, and critical infrastructure. They shouldn’t become a liability for customers, or in Harris’ words: “Are we expecting APT [Advanced Persistent Threat] groups to be our internal QA teams?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wysopal pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form"&gt;the Secure Software Development Attestation Form&lt;/a&gt; that the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) launched last year and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;its Secure by Design principles&lt;/a&gt; as a step in the right direction. The CISA program &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3971375/secure-by-design-is-likely-dead-at-cisa-will-the-private-sector-make-good-on-its-pledge.html"&gt;has seen some setbacks&lt;/a&gt; with two of the program’s architects and leaders, Lauren Zabierek and Bob Lord, leaving CISA in April amid staff and budget cuts. But it wouldn’t be surprising if other governments enacted legislation in the future to force the market’s hand. “I would be shocked if there’s not a conversation about regulation ongoing after the number of breaches we’ve now seen across fairly critical industries due to vulnerabilities in appliances that are mission-critical repeatedly, and then the root cause being questionable,” watchTowr’s Harris says. “It’s really now a race to see: Will enterprises vote with their wallets and their budgets, or will regulation come in first to help us begin to deal with this? But either way, something must change.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;aside class="sidebar"&gt;  
&lt;h3 id="vendor-efforts-to-stem-the-tide-on-network-edge-exploitation"&gt;Vendor efforts to stem the tide on network edge exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Vendors who responded to questions for this story all said they take secure development lifecycle practices seriously and are making investments in architectural changes, including rewriting legacy code. For example, Palo Alto Networks pointed to its implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux"&gt;Security-Enhanced Linux&lt;/a&gt; (SELinux) in full enforcement mode and &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-use-linux-kernels-integrity-measurement-architecture"&gt;Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA)&lt;/a&gt; in PAN-OS as examples of platform security hardening to mitigate entire classes of threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christopher Ganas, director of the Deep Product Security Research Team at Palo Alto’s network security division, told CSO that his team has tripled in size and has no budgetary constraints or other barriers for evolving the code base of the 20-year-old PAN-OS into a more secure architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that his team was created to investigate the root causes of bugs that tools and manual code reviews find and then to implement architectural changes to make exploitation of those flaws much harder. Often that means simplifying the architecture to make security boundaries — and the interactions between them — much clearer. That way, developers are better equipped to write secure code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a very long history of responsibly processing, remediating, disclosing vulnerabilities, but ultimately with how the threat landscape evolved over the last few years, there is this absolute need for us to go deeper into our products and ultimately find and address all of these architectural issues,” Ganas said. “We acknowledge the scale of exploitation across all vendors, but from our perspective, we fundamentally need to lead our industry and acknowledge that customers trust us with their security. We are offering them a security platform. We are ultimately protecting their network. We have to put ourselves to the highest standard of product security and operational excellence around these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivanti, whose security products were the target of multiple zero-day exploits by APT groups over the past two years, has also &lt;a href="https://www.ivanti.com/resources/secure-by-design/2024"&gt;signed the CISA Secure by Design pledge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ivanti.com/blog/from-legacy-to-security-ivanti-connect-secure"&gt;is making architectural changes and tackling the technical debt&lt;/a&gt; that has accumulated over decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The current threat landscape for edge devices is aggressive and sophisticated, and no company has been proven immune,” an Ivanti spokesperson told CSO. “[…] Recognizing meaningful advances don’t happen overnight, we committed to putting in the time and financial investment, including rearchitecting legacy products, embedding security throughout the development lifecycle, and anticipating potential adversary misuse across our planning process. We have not hesitated to touch older code as part of this effort.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Software Group, which owns NetScaler (aka Citrix NetScaler), has also signed &lt;a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2025/04/02/citrixs-approach-to-secure-by-design/"&gt;the CISA Secure by Design pledge&lt;/a&gt; and told CSO that it has embedded secure development methodologies throughout its engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At Cloud Software Group, we take security seriously,” the company said. “We have published our approach to security, including &lt;a href="https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/about/cloud-software-group-secure-development-lifecycle-for-citrix-and-netscaler-products-and-services.pdf"&gt;our secure development lifecycle (SDLC) process&lt;/a&gt;. Our dedicated Product Security Team, which serves as the cornerstone of this commitment, regularly reviews process improvements and is responsible for a comprehensive set of proactive and reactive security activities throughout the product lifecycle.” These include proactive vulnerability identification, implementation of strong security controls, driving secure development practices and product incident response management.” &lt;em&gt;— LC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Threat actors are spreading malicious extensions via VS marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074948/threat-actors-are-spreading-malicious-extensions-via-vs-marketplaces-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Careless developers publishing Visual Studio extensions to two open marketplaces have been including access tokens and other secrets that can be exploited by threat actors, a security vendor has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made earlier this year by researchers at Wiz, who quietly worked with Microsoft and its VSCode Marketplace as well as those behind the OpenVSX marketplace to improve guardrails in their platforms. It released a &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/supply-chain-risk-in-vscode-extension-marketplaces" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report on its investigation&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wiz found over 550 validated secrets, distributed across more than 500 extensions from hundreds of VS extension publishers. They included AI provider secrets for platforms such as OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, HuggingFace, and Perplexity; high risk profession platform secrets for AWS, Github, Stripe, Auth0, and Google Cloud Platform; and database secrets for MongoDB, Postgres, and Supabase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over 100 valid leaked Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens were identified within VSCode Marketplace extensions. Together, they represented an install base of over 85,000 extension installs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over thirty leaked OVSX access tokens were identified, within either VSCode Marketplace or OVSX extensions. Together they represented over 100,000 extension installs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The largest contributor to secrets leakage was the bundling by developers of hidden files, also known as dotfiles, says the report. The quantity of .env files was especially prominent, although hardcoded credentials in extension source code were also prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the Wiz investigation, researchers saw an increase in secrets leaking via AI-related configuration files, including config.json, mcp.json; and .cursorrules. Other common sources included build configurations (for example, package.json) and documentation such as README.md. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Wiz launched a notification campaign to alert impacted publishers and help them address these vulnerabilities. Microsoft also integrated secrets scanning capabilities prior to publication of extensions into its marketplace, and now blocks extensions with verified secrets, notifying extension owners when secrets are detected. &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/blog/security-and-trust-in-visual-studio-marketplace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Details are in a June announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenVSX is also adding a prefix (&lt;a href="https://github.com/EclipseFdn/open-vsx.org/pull/5261/files" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ovsxp_&lt;/a&gt;) to its tokens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We found that publishers often failed to consider that everything in the package was publicly available, or failed to successfully sanitize their extensions of hardcoded secrets,” &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/supply-chain-risk-in-vscode-extension-marketplaces" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wiz said in its report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse, some threat actors realized there was an opportunity to take advantage of these marketplaces to poison the extension supply chain, just as they have in recent years been trying, in many cases successfully, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4053725/massive-npm-supply-chain-attack-hits-18-popular-packages-with-2b-weekly-downloads.html" target="_blank"&gt;to plant malicious code&lt;/a&gt; in the NPM, GitHub, and other open code repositories. The Wiz investigation was triggered by the discovery in February that threat actors had tried to introduce malware into the VSCode Marketplace in a classic supply chain attack which could have spread it widely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker who discovered this weakness in the platform’s security would have been able to directly distribute malware to the cumulative 150,000 install base, says the Wiz report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery, only now being revealed by Wiz after remediation work by Microsoft and OpenVSX, is another example of why developers need to take more care in sanitizing their code before dropping it into open marketplaces, and why CSOs need to ensure extensions used by their developers are scrutinized closely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="developers-are-prime-targets"&gt;Developers are prime targets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers are a prime target for attacks, commented &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute. “What they often do not realize is that any extensions they install, even if they appear benign, like, for example, extensions to change the color of the code, have full access to their code and may make modifications without explicitly informing the developer. Extension marketplaces are just another repository of third-party code. They suffer from the same lack of oversight and review as other code repositories (for example, pip, npm, NuGet, and others). Upon installation of the extension, the developer will execute the code and provide the extension with far-reaching persistent access to their code base.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber criminals and nation states have found the new weak link in the security chain: the software supplier ecosystem, said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/?originalSubdomain=ca" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, head of Canadian-based security awareness firm Beauceron Security. “There’s been so many cases of this that it’s a clear, systemic issue,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And it’s not one we’re just going to fix with ‘AI,’ as this will continue to be a cat and mouse game. This is one of those wicked problems requiring changes in the legal liability landscape, culture change in enshrining security by design and continuing to teach developers about security principles. We’ve been extraordinarily lucky this year, with &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/npm-supply-chain-attack/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attacks like the Shai-Hulud Worm&lt;/a&gt; not burning us at a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563017/wannacry-explained-a-perfect-ransomware-storm.html" target="_blank"&gt;WannaCry scale&lt;/a&gt;. That luck will run out,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-vs-extensions"&gt;What are VS extensions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extensions and themes can be added to Visual Studio code to make life easier for developers, as well as to enhance functionality. An extension can add features like debuggers, new languages, or other development tools, while a theme is a type of extension that changes the appearance of the editor, controlling things like colors and fonts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft created the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VSCode Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; as an easy place for developers to browse for extensions and themes. But developers who don’t sanitize their work before uploading finished code to VSCode or OpenVSX marketplaces risk revealing access tokens that grant anyone the ability to automatically update the extension. If those tokens are controlled by a threat actor, they can automatically update all instances of the extension to a malicious version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Wiz report points out that security pros and developers should realize that not only can poorly written or compromised VS extensions be a problem, so can themes. In fact, the Wiz report notes that much of this massive vulnerable install base actually consists of themes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally, says the report, themes are viewed as safer than other extensions because they don’t carry any code. However, they still increase the attack surface as there is no technical control to prevent malware from being bundled into them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="similar-report"&gt;Similar report&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No organizations were impacted as a result of this issue, &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/authors/rami-mccarthy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rami McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, principal security researcher at Wiz, told CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in a separate discovery, this week &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072829/tigerjacks-malicious-vscode-extensions-mine-steal-and-stay-hidden.html" target="_blank"&gt;CSO reported&lt;/a&gt; that researchers at Koi Security had discovered there have been more than 17,000 downloads of 11 malicious extensions from the VSC and Open VSX marketplaces, placed by a threat group called TigerJack. Two of the campaign’s popular extensions, “C++ Payground” and “HTTP Format”, have been removed, but the operation continues through re-uploads of the malware-infested code using fresh accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of these malicious extensions, Koi Security said, quietly uploads a developer’s source code to external endpoints, another uses local resources for cryptomining, and the most sophisticated variant can execute JavaScript remotely without needing fresh updates to expand or change functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;McCarthy says the issue Wiz Research identified was even more severe, because it could have allowed attackers to weaponize more than a hundred legitimate extensions, automatically installing malware on over 185,000 developer machines. Wiz also found evidence that some attackers inflate download numbers through “download pumping,” which can make reported installation figures unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a consistent threat model for extension marketplaces yet, McCarthy said, making it difficult for any platform to anticipate these risks. However, he added, Microsoft’s marketplace has seen deeper security investment than Open VSX, and the research highlights why that matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He agreed that the report is another example of why developers need to take more care in sanitizing their code before dropping it into open marketplaces. But, he added, it’s also an example of how platforms can build in guardrails to minimize risk from individual developer errors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Developer security is a shared responsibility between publishers and the ecosystems that host their work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advice-to-csos-developers"&gt;Advice to CSOs, developers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wiz says VSCode users should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;limit the number of installed extensions in their work. Each extension introduces an extended threat surface, which should be measured against the benefit of its usage;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;review extension trust criteria. Consider installation prevalence, reviews, extension history, and publisher reputation, among other metadata, prior to adoption;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;consider auto-update tradeoffs. Auto-updating extensions ensures you receive security updates, but introduces the risk of a compromised extension pushing malware to your machine. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Corporate security teams should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;develop an IDE extension inventory, in order to respond to reports of malicious extensions;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;consider creating a centralized allowlist for VSCode extensions;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;consider sourcing extensions from the VSCode Marketplace, which currently has higher review rigor and controls, over the OpenVSX Marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders should use device management and endpoint security tooling to inventory and enforce allowlists for extensions, said Wiz’s McCarthy. Centrally approving extensions helps reduce risk, but it’s also important to preserve flexibility for developers, to let them use tools that drive innovation. Extensions bring real value, but their long tail can introduce a significant attack surface if unmanaged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no good way to verify that an application has not been compromised, warned the SANS Institute’s Ullrich. Standard endpoint and network security solutions can assist in protecting developers, but they need to be tuned to be effective and it is difficult to identify malicious extensions. In particular, developer workstations often have specific benign usage patterns that cause excessive false positives if the solution is not carefully tuned. Thus, developers should attempt to minimize the number of extensions they install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cybercrime-as-a-service takedown: 7 arrested</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/cybercrime-service-takedown-7-arrested</link>
      <description>An action day performed in Latvia on 10 October 2025 led to the arrest of five cybercriminals of Latvian nationality and the seizure of infrastructure used to enable crimes against thousands of victims across Europe. During the operation codenamed ‘SIMCARTEL’, law enforcement arrested two further suspects, took down five servers and seized 1 200 SIM box devices alongside 40 000 active SIM cards. Investigators from Austria, Estonia and Latvia, together with their colleagues at Europol und Eurojust, were able to attribute to the criminal network more than 1 700 individual cyber fraud cases in Austria and 1 500 in Latvia, with a total loss of several million euros. The financial loss in Austria alone amounts to around EUR 4.5 million, as well as EUR 420 000 in Latvia.</description>

      <title>US NSA alleged to have launched a cyber attack on a Chinese agency</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4075846/us-nsa-alleged-to-have-launched-a-cyber-attack-on-a-chinese-agency.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China’s claim that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was behind a cyber attack against the country’s timekeeping centre could be true, says an expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From a technical perspective, China’s allegation about an NSA hack on its national timekeeping center is plausible and aligns with known US cyber capabilities,”  &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/profile/jeff-bardin/" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Bardin&lt;/a&gt;, chief intelligence officer at US-based Treadstone 71, told CSO on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, he added, “without public evidence it’s hard to confirm conclusively.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was commenting on a &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZtKjlaIoMVCSY-rXt2RP1Q" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post last week on WeChat&lt;/a&gt; from China’s Ministry of National Security saying, “national security authorities uncovered a major cyber attack case in the United States and obtained irrefutable evidence that the National Security Agency launched a cyber attack and invaded China’s National Time Service Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The public affairs section of China’s Washington, D.C. embassy confirmed to CSO that the post “is from China’s security authorities.” The allegation&lt;a href="https://x.com/ChineseEmbinUS" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; is also repeated on the Chinese embassy’s X feed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The timekeeping center “provides high-precision timing services to the nation’s communications, finance, power, transportation, surveying and mapping, defense, and other sectors, and provides crucial data support for the calculation of international standard time,” the post says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cyber attack “would impact the secure and stable operation of ‘Beijing Time,’” says the post, referring to the country’s single time zone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attack, the post says, would lead “to serious consequences such as network communication failures, financial system disruptions, power outages, transportation disruptions, and space launch failures. It could even cause chaos in international time, resulting in incalculable damage and losses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="allegedly-took-advantage-of-sms-vulnerability"&gt;Allegedly took advantage of SMS vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The WeChat post alleges that, starting on March 25, 2022, “the NSA exploited a vulnerability in the SMS service of an overseas mobile phone brand to covertly attack and gain control of the mobile phones of multiple NSC staff members, stealing sensitive data stored within them.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, an NSA spokesperson sent this reply by email: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;NSA does not confirm nor deny allegations in the media regarding its operations. Our core focus is countering foreign malign activities persistently targeting American interests, and we will continue to defend against adversaries wishing to threaten us.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chinese post says the country “shattered the US cyber attack plot of stealing secrets and infiltration and sabotage, and made every effort to protect the security of ‘Beijing Time.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="possible-serious-escalation"&gt;Possible ‘serious escalation’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the recent Chinese claim against the NSA is true, said Bardin, it suggests a strategic intent by the US not just to spy, but to position the country to potentially disrupt a core piece of Chinese infrastructure — the timing system underpinning communications, finance, energy, and defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That, he said, “would mark a serious escalation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s also striking,” he added, “that Beijing went public with this claim, since China typically avoids admitting breaches of its own critical systems. China’s public accusation signals a bid to sway international opinion, painting the US as a global ‘hacker empire’ and rallying other nations behind calls to rein in state-sponsored cyber intrusions. Beijing is expected to bolster its cyber defenses and could even hint at tit-for-tat moves against US timekeeping networks to deter further incursions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Economically, he added, “the incident continues China’s push for tech self-reliance – tightening supply chains and fast-tracking homegrown alternatives (such as sovereign timing systems) – as it seeks to reduce exposure to US tech influence amid already high trade and technology tensions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The Chinese allegation also fits with the pattern of behavior from Beijing “leaning forward with public attribution of what they consider malicious cyber activity … and oftentimes that attribution is not necessarily accurate,” said Matthew Ferren, international affairs fellow in national security at the US Council on Foreign Relations. In fact, he couldn’t say whether there was an attack or an intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This tells me nothing about what may or may not have happened in the real world, but it does fit within the pattern of behavior of the Chinese to shape narratives around the United States being an irresponsible actor in the cyber domain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="advice-for-cisos"&gt;Advice for CISOs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time services are an interesting and often overlooked target, said Johannes Ullrich, dean of research at the SANS Institute, because many authentication protocols rely on accurate time services. To prevent replay of old attestations, these systems require synchronized times. If the times are not synchronized, messages from authentication servers will be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simplest result of a compromised time service is a denial of service attack. Or, he added, it can lead to bypassing some authentication or access control checks, or the ability to replay old authentication messages to gain access to systems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CISOs should not neglect these time services,” he said in an email. “It is too easy to leave them in a default configuration which often uses undefined open cloud based time server pools. Instead, internal time servers should be defined to serve as an internal standard, and these internal time standards need to be synchronized with carefully selected sources like GPS or time servers run by a trusted entity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Treadstone 71’s Bardin said that CSOs in any country who want to protect themselves from a sophisticated nation-state attacker should treat time infrastructure linked to their servers as a national-level dependency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Segment and isolate all systems relying on NTP (network time protocol) or GPS sources, verify clock integrity against multiple independent references and deploy cryptographic attestation for time signals, he advised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also recommends disabling SMS-based login authentication for privileged access, enforcing out-of-band multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring for anomalies in timing drift or certificate use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added that red team drills simulating loss of trusted time, which will validate IT operational resilience, is also worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To assist defenders, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/nation-state-cyber-actors" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offers this advice&lt;/a&gt; to organizations to help protect themselves from nation-state attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>CISOs’ security priorities reveal an augmented cyber agenda</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074969/cisos-security-priorities-reveal-an-augmented-cyber-agenda.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology may be changing rapidly but one thing remains constant: It’s not an easy time to be a CSO. The role continues to evolve with security leaders &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3851735/cisos-are-taking-on-ever-more-responsibilities-and-functional-roles-has-it-gone-too-far.html"&gt;taking on even more responsibilities&lt;/a&gt;, and 76% reporting that understanding which security solutions best fit their company has grown more complex, according to CSO’s 2025 Security Priorities Study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, 57% of respondents report their organization has struggled to find the root cause of security incidents they experienced in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These days, security leaders find themselves tasked with a range of high-level responsibilities, including cyber strategy and policy development, risk management, and managing the risks of AI-enabled technology. Moreover, 67% of security leaders say their responsibilities require them to address security issues outside their country or region.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holding them back are perennial problems: employee awareness training; lack of budget; retaining qualified employees; process complexity; and, increasingly, the ability to address the risks presented by disruptive technologies such as AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="protecting-data-continues-to-be-a-key-priority"&gt;Protecting data continues to be a key priority&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to CSO’s survey, security leaders have several key areas of focus, including strengthening protection of confidential and sensitive data (48%), securing cloud data and systems (45%), and simplifying IT security infrastructure (39%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 06 Key Priorities" class="wp-image-4074985" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/06-key-priorities-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharylewis1/"&gt;Zach Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, CIO and CISO of University of Health Sciences &amp;amp; Pharmacy in St. Louis, says &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;consolidating tools&lt;/a&gt; and using what they have more fully are his main priorities going into next year. “We’re moving more in the direction of platforms instead of best of breed to try and find some cost savings and simplify the tech stack,’’ Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the university’s data governance journey continues. “We have managed to classify and categorize our data,’’ he says. “Now we are locking that data into our retention period policy and cleaning up duplicate data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-plans-vary"&gt;AI plans vary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI continues to penetrate deeper into the enterprise, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4042494/how-ai-is-reshaping-cybersecurity-operations.html"&gt;including the security operations center&lt;/a&gt;. Seventy-three percent of security decision-makers are more likely this year to consider a security solution that uses AI, up from 59% in 2024, and 58% plan to increase spending on AI-enabled security technology, according to the CSO survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nethealth.com/author/keavymurphy/"&gt;Keavy Murphy&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of security at Net Health, is giving considerable thought to AI’s impact and how the organization is going to navigate the technology heading into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This year, it became abundantly clear that AI isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s becoming more integral than ever, even in industries like healthcare that have historically been considered laggards,’’ Murphy says. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nethealth.com/lp/technology-strategies-for-reimbursement/"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; of healthcare leaders Net Health participated in, 93% of respondents indicated their organizations are prioritizing AI adoption for clinical decision support in the next 12 to 24 months, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same survey revealed that confidence in AI is still forming, and adoption will depend on whether these tools demonstrate sufficient ROI, ease of use, and regulatory safety, Murphy notes. While she is “in full support of this level of AI adoption,” Murphy acknowledges that this “might be an unusual take from a cybersecurity expert, since many of us are wary of advanced technologies that might open us up to threat.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Murphy reasons that since “there’s no question that bad actors will be using AI and the most advanced software possible in their attacks,’’ organizations that are susceptible to these attacks, like hospitals or private practices, must respond with equally sophisticated tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think AI is an incredible innovation that can help healthcare organizations streamline so many of their day-to-day operations like documentation, administrative tasks, and more,’’ she explains. “It’s only right that we take advantage of it for cybersecurity purposes, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is already party of cyber risk planning at Aflac, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-callahan-4b39241/"&gt;Tim Callahan&lt;/a&gt;, global CISO, who expects its usage will only increase in 2026. Already, his team is leveraging AI and machine learning &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059116/6-novel-ways-to-use-ai-in-cybersecurity.html"&gt;for threat detection and response&lt;/a&gt; as well as malware identification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, AI is also helping us automate repetitive tasks, triage alerts, and prioritize vulnerabilities, but never at the expense of a hands-on approach where expert evaluation and intelligence is critical,’’ Callahan stresses. “As the world’s adversaries launch more sophisticated AI-driven attacks, it is critical that we use these technologies to not only keep pace but stay ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He says leadership is carefully evaluating AI’s role at Aflac and within the cybersecurity teams, “especially as regulatory frameworks adapt to new technologies.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis of University of Health Sciences &amp;amp; Pharmacy is not as gung-ho on AI, saying it will not play a significant role in his cyber risk planning. While things like phishing emails, video deepfakes, voice fakes, and fake images are a concern, “foundationally, a lot of things still hold,’’ he says. “I’m not pouring a ton of funding into that; just reinforcing those … security stack pieces that I already have in place and making sure that users are aware and that our systems are tuned properly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="concern-over-ai-enabled-attacks-rises"&gt;Concern over AI-enabled attacks rises&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Net Health’s Murphy, security buyers are concerned about AI-enabled cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, 38% of respondents expressed worry about AI-enabled ransomware, while security leaders also cited attackers leveraging AI to facilitate attack automation (35%) and an adversary’s use of AI to hunt for vulnerabilities in their enterprise (33%) as other top AI-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 21 AI-Enabled Concerns" class="wp-image-4074987" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21-AI-enabled-concerns-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_753808.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, 41% are planning to leverage AI to detect threats, for anomaly detection, and to automate security responses. Other respondents cited plans to leverage AI for malware detection and real-time risk prediction (39%), as well as DLP and improving enterprise system visibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, 40% expect to see AI enhancements as part of their existing security systems — without additional charges — while 32% are willing to pay a premium for AI-enabled security solutions that meet their specific security needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 24 AI Plans" class="wp-image-4074988" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/24-ai-plans-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_ec4a7b.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-benefits-ai-security-tech-provides"&gt;The benefits AI security tech provides&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A whopping 99% of respondents have already seen benefits from the AI-enabled security technologies, up from 72% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the benefits: faster identification of unknown threats (44%), accelerated detection and response times (42%), the ability to sift through large amounts of data faster(42%), reduced employee workloads due to automation (42%), and the ability of to be more proactive (42%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tool-priorities-for-a-shifting-threat-landscape"&gt;Tool priorities for a shifting threat landscape&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders report a wide range of tools in production, including solutions for authentication (36%), security awareness and training (35%), incident response (34%), DLP (33%), and EDR (32%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools on their radar include security analytics (28%), enterprise security management (27%), SIEM (26%), and data governance (26%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 16 Tools in Use" class="wp-image-4074989" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16-tools-in-use-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_c5352a.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aflac’s Callahan says his organization is prioritizing “highly evolved security tools.’’ For example, the company took a customized approach when &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3965399/security-leaders-shed-light-on-their-zero-trust-journeys.html"&gt;implementing zero trust&lt;/a&gt;, including access detection and blocking, he says. “This approach has helped us avoid mistakes and pitfalls that could impact our business,’’ Callahan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next year, the plan is to implement tools “that increase visibility and provide better automation and integration across our environment,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The University of Health Sciences &amp;amp; Pharmacy recently added a new DLP tool that is still in stealth mode, which “comes back to the AI concerns,’’ Lewis says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He is also planning to consolidate a couple of tools focused on email security and utilizing Microsoft’s email gateway and other security pieces, since the university is a Microsoft shop. That will give him the ability to purchase the DLP system, “which is very important, as our data is now going into more AI systems,” he says. “I want to be sure I’m keeping an eye on that and making sure sensitive and proprietary data or research isn’t slipping away into these public LLMs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="budgets-will-remain-relatively-unchanged"&gt;Budgets will remain relatively unchanged&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some 55% of respondents said their security budgets will remain the same, while 43% report expecting an increase, according to the Security Priorities survey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis anticipates level funding next year, with a possible 1% increase, which is par for the course in higher ed, he says. “I will make do with the tools I have,’’ he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Any increases to Callahan’s budget at Aflac “will be driven by the need to invest in advanced technologies, tactics to address emerging regulatory requirements, and the ongoing need for talent development,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Survey respondents reported the main business priorities driving security spending to be: increasing cybersecurity protections (42%), increasing operational efficiency (37%), accelerating AI-driven innovation and applications (31%), improving profitability (30%), and transforming existing business processes such as automation and integration (30%).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="msps-retain-their-value-as-the-security-landscape-grows-more-complex"&gt;MSPs retain their value as the security landscape grows more complex&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another finding in this year’s survey is that 90% of respondents plan to outsource security functions to a managed services provider (MSP) or other third-party provider in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aflac has been utilizing managed security service providers (MSSPs) for years, particularly to provide 24/7 coverage, Callahan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In 2026, we will continue to expand our partnerships with third-party providers, though not to replace our core team, but rather to enhance our team’s outputs around strategic initiatives,’’ he says. “As the environment grows more complex, we expect to see additional support in areas such as vulnerability management and compliance.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis echoes that, saying the university will continue to use third-party providers to have 24/7 SOC coverage. His MSSP is also handling SIEM, logging events, and EDR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="csos-visibility-is-on-the-rise"&gt;CSOs’ visibility is on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As their responsibilities increase, security leaders are gaining the attention of their boards — 95% reported they engage with their board of directors, up from 85% in 2023. Forty-eight percent engage with their board multiple times a month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 70% of respondents report that someone on their organization’s board of directors has specific responsibility or oversight for cybersecurity, up from 59% in 2024. Seventy-two percent said engagement with their board has helped improve cybersecurity/security initiatives, up from 66% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="2025 Security Priorities Survey: Slide 11 Boards" class="wp-image-4074990" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/11-boards-R-PP_CSO_Security_Priorities_2025_43a647.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;CSO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewis meets with the university’s board or audit committee almost quarterly, and he thinks that’s adequate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think a lot of CISOs really think they need a seat at table,’’ which may be organization- or industry-specific, he says. But he believes security leaders ought to instead work on having a better relationship with their CEO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs should be “working to secure things more internally than necessarily what’s happened externally, and having that relationship with the executive team [and] other functional leaders in the organization,’’ he says. That, Lewis adds, is “arguably more important than necessarily having a seat at the board table.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSO’s Security Priorities Report surveyed 641 respondents to gain a better understanding of the various security projects organizations are focused on now and in the coming year. The research also looked at issues that will demand the most time and strategic thinking for IT and security teams. Respondents came from North America (46%), APAC (36%), and EMEA (18%).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The average company size is 14,494 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Foreign hackers breached a US nuclear weapons plant via SharePoint flaws</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4074962/foreign-hackers-breached-a-us-nuclear-weapons-plant-via-sharepoint-flaws.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A foreign threat actor infiltrated the &lt;a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/"&gt;Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC)&lt;/a&gt;, a key manufacturing site within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), exploiting unpatched Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to a source involved in an August incident response at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach targeted a plant that produces the vast majority of critical non-nuclear components for US nuclear weapons under the NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy (DOE) that oversees the design, production, and maintenance of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Honeywell Federal Manufacturing &amp;amp; Technologies (FM&amp;amp;T) manages the Kansas City campus under contract to the NNSA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City campus, Honeywell FM&amp;amp;T, and the Department of Energy did not respond to repeated requests for comment throughout September, well before the current government shutdown. NSA public affairs officer Eddie Bennett did respond, saying, “We have nothing to contribute,” and referred CSO back to the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it is unclear whether the attackers were a Chinese nation-state actor or Russian cybercriminals — the two most likely culprits — experts say the incident drives home the importance of securing systems that protect operational technology from exploits that primarily affect IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-breach-unfolded"&gt;How the breach unfolded&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers exploited &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025691/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-breach-hits-on-prem-servers.html"&gt;two recently disclosed Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; — CVE-2025-53770, a spoofing flaw, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution (RCE) bug — both affecting on-premises servers. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/"&gt;issued fixes&lt;/a&gt; for the vulnerabilities on July 19.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On July 22, the NNSA &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/us-nuclear-weapons-agency-breached-in-microsoft-sharepoint-hack"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was one of the organizations hit by attacks enabled by the SharePoint flaws. “On Friday, July 18th, the exploitation of a Microsoft SharePoint zero-day vulnerability began affecting the Department of Energy,” a DOE spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the DOE contended at the time, “The department was minimally impacted due to its widespread use of the Microsoft M365 cloud and very capable cybersecurity systems. A very small number of systems were impacted. All impacted systems are being restored.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By early August, federal responders, including personnel from the NSA, were on-site at the Kansas City facility, the source tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Located in Missouri, the &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/ea/kansas-city-national-security-campus"&gt;KCNSC manufactures&lt;/a&gt; non-nuclear mechanical, electronic, and engineered material components used in US nuclear defense systems. It also provides specialized technical services, including metallurgical analysis, analytical chemistry, environmental testing, and simulation modeling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Roughly 80% of the non-nuclear parts in the nation’s nuclear stockpile &lt;a href="https://kcnsc.doe.gov/about-us/overview/"&gt;originate from KCNSC&lt;/a&gt;. While most design and programmatic details remain classified, the plant’s production role makes it one of the most sensitive facilities in the federal weapons complex.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="china-or-russia-conflicting-attribution"&gt;China or Russia? Conflicting attribution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/#storm-2603"&gt;attributed the broader wave of SharePoint exploitations&lt;/a&gt; to three Chinese-linked groups: Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and a third actor it tracks as Storm-2603. The company said the attackers were preparing to deploy Warlock ransomware across affected systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the source familiar with the Kansas City incident tells CSO that a Russian threat actor, not a Chinese one, was responsible for the intrusion. Cybersecurity company Resecurity, which was monitoring the SharePoint exploitations, tells CSO that its own data pointed primarily to Chinese nation-state groups, but it does not rule out Russian involvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resecurity’s researchers say that while Chinese groups appeared to have developed and deployed the initial zero-day, financially motivated Russian actors may have independently reproduced the exploit before technical details began circulating in late June.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May, researchers at Viettel Cyber Security &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-exploited-in-rce-attacks-no-patch-available/"&gt;demonstrated an attack chaining two SharePoint flaws&lt;/a&gt;, CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704, at Pwn2Own Berlin. Resecurity researchers tell CSO that those demonstrations likely accelerated the reverse-engineering of the vulnerabilities by multiple threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Resecurity’s analysts observed early-stage scanning and exploitation activity from infrastructure located in Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, and Hong Kong, a distribution pattern consistent with tactics used by Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to disguise attribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The root cause of the SharePoint exploitation is closely related to misuse of the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) by China,” Resecurity researchers tell CSO. “The most probable perpetrators are Chinese nation-state actors such as Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, they say that yet another way that Russia-based threat actors could have acquired knowledge of the vulnerability early on was through underground exchanges or by analyzing network scanning data once the exploit became known. The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4027971/microsofts-incomplete-sharepoint-patch-led-to-global-exploits-by-china-linked-hackers.html"&gt;transition from zero-day to N-day status&lt;/a&gt;, they say, opened a window for secondary actors to exploit systems that had not yet applied the patches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="could-the-attack-have-reached-operational-systems"&gt;Could the attack have reached operational systems?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach targeted the IT side of the Kansas City campus, but the intrusion raises the question of whether attackers could have moved laterally into the facility’s operational technology (OT) systems, the manufacturing and process control environments that directly support weapons component production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OT cybersecurity specialists interviewed by CSO say that KCNSC’s production systems are likely air-gapped or otherwise isolated from corporate IT networks, significantly reducing the risk of direct crossover. Nevertheless, they caution against assuming such isolation guarantees safety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have to really consider and think through how state actors potentially exploit IT vulnerabilities to gain access to that operational technology,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jensovada/"&gt;Jen Sovada&lt;/a&gt;, general manager of public sector operations at Claroty, speaking generally and not about the specific incident, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you have a facility like the KCNSC where they do nuclear weapons lifecycle management — design, manufacturing, emergency response, decommissioning, supply chain management — there are multiple interconnected functions,” Sovada says. “If an actor can move laterally, they could impact programmable logic controllers that run robotics or precision assembly equipment for non-nuclear weapon components.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such access, Sovada adds, could also affect distribution control systems that oversee quality assurance, or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that manage utilities, power, and environmental controls. “It’s broader than just an IT vulnerability,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="it-ot-convergence-and-the-zero-trust-gap"&gt;IT/OT convergence and the zero-trust gap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Kansas City incident highlights a systemic problem across the federal enterprise: the disconnect between IT and OT security practices. While the federal government has advanced its zero-trust roadmap for traditional IT networks, similar frameworks for operational environments have lagged, although recent developments point to progress on that front.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s an &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/deploy/networks"&gt;IT fan chart&lt;/a&gt; that maps all of the controls for zero trust, segmentation, authentication, and identity management,” Sovada says. “But there’s also an &lt;a href="https://www.meritalk.com/articles/dod-official-sees-new-zero-trust-ot-iot-guidance-in-september/#:~:text=The%20DoD%20official%20also%20provided,OT%20%E2%80%9Clikely%20around%20August.%E2%80%9D"&gt;OT fan chart&lt;/a&gt; being developed by the Department of Defense that will define comparable controls for zero trust in operational technology. The goal is to marry the two, so that zero trust becomes comprehensive across all network types.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That alignment, she says, is essential to preventing intrusions like the one that struck KCNSC from cascading into physical operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="even-non-classified-data-theft-holds-strategic-value"&gt;Even non-classified data theft holds strategic value&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the source’s claim of Russian involvement is accurate, the attackers may have been financially motivated ransomware operators rather than state intelligence services. But even in that scenario, the data they accessed could still carry strategic value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would make sense that if it were a ransomware actor and they got this kind of data about nuclear weapons manufacturing, they might pause and hand it off to the appropriate Russian government officials or experts,” Sovada tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that classified information was compromised, even unclassified technical data can have significant implications. “It could be something as simple as requirements documents that may not be classified but reveal the level of precision required for components,” Sovada says. “In weapons manufacturing, a millimeter difference can change a device’s trajectory or the reliability of its arming mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such information could aid adversaries in understanding US weapons tolerances, supply chain dependencies, or manufacturing processes, all of which are sensitive even if not formally secret.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether the intruders were Chinese state actors or Russian cybercriminals, the Kansas City breach exposes the fragile intersection of IT and operational security across critical defense infrastructure. As Sovada stresses, “We can’t just think of zero trust as an IT concept anymore. It has to extend into the physical systems that underpin national defense.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: The Department of Energy (DOE) &lt;a href="https://url.usb.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/zIpmCk6xoxI592Kxt2fVuGXZyW?domain=edition.cnn.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that it is furloughing the vast major of the NNSA’s workers. DOE spokesperson said, “Since its creation in 2000, NNSA has never before furloughed federal workers during funding lapses. We are left with no choice this time. We’ve extended funding as long as we could.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
