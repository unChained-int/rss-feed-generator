      <title>Four new vulnerabilities found in Ingress NGINX</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128439/four-new-vulnerabilities-found-in-ingress-nginx.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four security vulnerabilities have been found in the open source Ingress NGINX traffic controller that is extensively used by organizations in Kubernetes deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can only be fixed by upgrading to the latest version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the four holes, two are more serious, because they carry CVSS scores of 8.8:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/136677" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-1580&lt;/a&gt; is an improper input validation issue. If the Ingress NGINX controller is configured with a default &lt;em&gt;custom-errors&lt;/em&gt; configuration that includes HTTP errors 401 or 403, and if the configured default &lt;em&gt;custom-errors&lt;/em&gt; backend is defective and fails to respect the X-Code HTTP header, then an Ingress with the &lt;em&gt;auth-url&lt;/em&gt; annotation may be accessed even when authentication fails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/136678" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-24512 &lt;/a&gt;is a configuration injection vulnerability where the &lt;em&gt;rules.http.paths.path&lt;/em&gt; Ingress field can be used to inject configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of secrets accessible to the controller. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a serious vulnerability,” commented Kellman Meghu, CTO of Canada’s DeepCove Cybersecurity, who has experience with Ingress NGINX.  “If I could exploit it, I could get the Ingress gateway to create a path directly to internal resources. It’s like opening the insides that should never be exposed. Will that lead to further exposure or hacks? Probably, but in terms of impact, it’s a first step to gain access into the environment, and from there it could go further, the least of which would be disruption of services.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NGINX is a reverse proxy/load balancer that generally acts as the front-end web traffic receiver and directs it to the application service for data transformation. Ingress NGINX is a version used in Kubernetes as the controller for traffic coming into the infrastructure. It takes care of mapping traffic to pods of containers running jobs without exposing the pods themselves.  Meghu says Ingress NGINX is the primary traffic entry point, and is effective due to its ability to reload its configuration on the fly, allowing it to adjust to changes inside a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities only affect Ingress NGINX versions 1.13.7 and below, and 1.14.3 and below, if they are installed on a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The warning comes just weeks before, as announced at KubeCon in November, &lt;a href="https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;support for Ingress NGINX ends&lt;/a&gt;. Starting in March, the project will no longer receive active maintenance, security patches, or bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have been urging Kubernetes administrators to shift to a new controller ever since. They recommend &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/gateway/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kubernetes Gateway API&lt;/a&gt; as the standard for traffic management. Meghu notes it is vendor neutral and widely used. Other options are controllers such as Cilium Ingress, Traefik, or HAProxy Ingress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to CVE-2026-24512, the other new vulnerabilities are &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-24513" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-24513&lt;/a&gt;, considered by Meghu a low risk since an attacker needs to have a config containing specific errors to exploit, and &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-24514" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-24514&lt;/a&gt;, which Meghu considers a medium risk. The controller could be subject to a denial of service if an attacker overwhelms it with requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are just the most recent issues with Ingress NGINX. Just over a year ago, researchers at Wiz discovered a group of holes&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3854089/critical-rce-flaws-put-kubernetes-clusters-at-risk-of-takeover.html" target="_blank"&gt; dubbed IngressNightmar&lt;/a&gt;e. They can allow unauthenticated users to inject malicious NGINX configurations and execute malicious code into the Ingress NGINX pod, potentially exposing all cluster secrets and leading to cluster takeover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, told &lt;em&gt;CSO &lt;/em&gt;that he considers the new holes less concerning than IngressNightmare, which he called a “toxic combination” that could result in cluster takeover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While there’s nothing novel about [the new vulnerabilities], they serve as a stark reminder to all admins that if they haven’t started migrating, they need to start immediately, before Ingres NGINX is retired next month. Given its upcoming retirement, migration is the best strategy to mitigate these vulnerabilities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cybersicherheitsvorschriften: So erfüllen Sie Ihre Compliance-Anforderungen</title>

Ein börsennotiertes Unternehmen hat beispielsweise keine andere Wahl, als mehrere Vorschriften einzuhalten sowie Risikobewertungen und Pläne für Abhilfemaßnahmen zu erstellen. Regierungsbehörden oder Unternehmen, die an Regierungsbehörden verkaufen, müssen bestimmte Compliance-Anforderungen des öffentlichen Sektors erfüllen. Banken, Organisationen des Gesundheitswesens, Infrastrukturunternehmen, E-Commerce-Firmen und andere Unternehmen haben jeweils eigene branchenspezifische Compliance-Regeln zu befolgen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesetipp:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492518/pci-dss-4-0-sind-sie-bereit-furs-neue-kreditkarten-regelwerk.html" target="_blank" title="Sind Sie bereit fürs neue Kreditkarten-Regelwerk?"&gt;Sind Sie bereit fürs neue Kreditkarten-Regelwerk?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sicherheit-ist-nicht-gleich-compliance"&gt;Sicherheit ist nicht gleich Compliance&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch für Unternehmen, die nicht in eine dieser Kategorien fallen, kann es Gründe geben, warum sie bewährte Sicherheitspraktiken nachweisen müssen, zum Beispiel, wenn sie eine &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492356/security-standard-wie-sie-sich-auf-ein-soc-2-audit-vorbereiten.html" target="_blank" title="SOC-Zertifizierung"&gt;SOC-Zertifizierung&lt;/a&gt; anstreben oder eine Cyberversicherung beantragen. Umfassende Rahmenwerke für die Einhaltung von Cybersicherheitsvorschriften wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4103179/nis2-umsetzen-ohne-im-papierkrieg-zu-enden.html" target="_blank"&gt;NIS-2&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495826/iso-und-isms-darum-gehen-security-zertifizierungen-schief.html" target="_blank" title="ISO"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt; bieten allen Unternehmen Leitlinien, die sie befolgen können, sowie Strukturen für die Kommunikation der Ergebnisse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aber: Nur, weil man die Vorschriften einhält, heißt das noch lange nicht, dass man auch sicher ist. Erfahrene Sicherheitsexperten betrachten die Einhaltung von Vorschriften als das absolute Minimum und gehen in ihren Empfehlungen weit über die erforderlichen Komponenten zum Schutz ihrer Unternehmen hinaus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="einhaltung-der-vorschriften-als-voraussetzung-fr-geschftsttigkeit"&gt;Einhaltung der Vorschriften als Voraussetzung für Geschäftstätigkeit&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Sicherheitsmanager kann zwar Investitionen und Praktiken für die Cybersicherheit empfehlen, um die Compliance-Anforderungen zu erfüllen, aber er ist nicht der letzte Entscheidungsträger. Eine wichtige Aufgabe des CISO besteht daher darin, das Risiko der Nichteinhaltung von Vorschriften zu kommunizieren und gemeinsam mit anderen Unternehmensleitern zu entscheiden, welche Initiativen Vorrang haben sollen. Das Risiko umfasst in diesem Zusammenhang nicht nur das technische, sondern auch das Geschäftsrisiko. Um Reibungsverluste zu vermeiden, ist es daher sinnvoll, den Mitarbeitern auch den geschäftlichen Nutzen einer konformen Cybersicherheit aufzuzeigen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="kosten-nutzen-abwgung"&gt;Kosten-Nutzen-Abwägung&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Unternehmensführung muss dabei die Kosten und den Nutzen der Einhaltung von Vorschriften gegen die potenziellen Kosten der Nichteinhaltung abwägen. Angenommen ein Unternehmen erfüllt eine Best Practice für die Verwaltung von Berechtigungen nicht vollständig: Bei Nichteinhaltung der Vorschriften können die zugrunde liegenden Schwachstellen neben möglichen Klagen von Anteilseignern noch größere Auswirkungen auf das Unternehmen haben, einschließlich Ausfallzeiten, Ransomware-Zahlungen und Umsatzeinbußen. Die Erfüllung der Compliance-Anforderungen könnte hingegen einen geschäftlichen Nutzen bringen, beispielsweise durch schnellere Verkäufe, stärkere Partnerschaften oder niedrigere Cyberversicherungsraten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="wie-cisos-compliance-rahmenwerke-nutzen-knnen"&gt;Wie CISOs Compliance-Rahmenwerke nutzen können&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs können vorhandene Compliance-Frameworks als Methodik für Techniken und Prozesse verwenden, um sie in ihr Cybersicherheitsprogramm einzubauen. Zu ihren Aufgaben gehört es im Wesentlichen, über die Programmprioritäten zu informieren und eine “Einkaufsliste” für Lösungen zu erstellen, die sie unbedingt benötigen und die mit dem Programm, das sie aufbauen wollen, übereinstimmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aber es gibt auch einen Unterschied zwischen der Verwendung eines Compliance-Rahmenwerkes zur Steuerung eines fundierten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492182/cybersicherheit-und-risikomanagement-hand-in-hand-zur-resilienz.html" target="_blank" title="Risikomanagements"&gt;Risikomanagements&lt;/a&gt; und der exakten Einhaltung von Vorschriften. Hier gilt es einen Balanceakt zu meistern und fallweise auch risikobasierte Entscheidungen zu treffen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cisos-brauchen-partner-bei-der-einhaltung-von-vorschriften"&gt;CISOs brauchen Partner bei der Einhaltung von Vorschriften&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs sitzen bei der Einhaltung von Vorschriften nicht allein im Boot. Sie müssen Partnerschaften mit Rechtsteams, Datenschutzbeauftragten und Prüfungs- oder Risikoausschüssen aufbauen, um die sich ändernden Compliance-Anforderungen zu verstehen und zu entscheiden, wie sie zu erfüllen sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manchmal verlangen diese internen Partner von den Sicherheitsteams, dass sie stärkere Kontrollen einführen, aber sie können auch auf die Bremse treten. So würden manche CISOs gerne das Verhalten ihrer Mitarbeiter detailliert überwachen, aber die Datenschutzgesetze verbieten dies und die Rechtsabteilung sorgt dafür, dass diese Gesetze eingehalten werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compliance-Teams erledigen viele Dinge für die Sicherheitsingenieure und -analysten, die weder die Zeit noch die Ressourcen dafür haben. Sie nehmen die Sicherheit in die Pflicht und überprüfen, ob die Kontrollen wie erwartet funktionieren. Sie fungieren quasi als Vermittler zwischen Sicherheitsteams, Aufsichtsbehörden und Prüfern, um die Einhaltung der Vorschriften nachzuweisen, sei es durch das Sammeln von Beweisen mittels manueller Sicherheitsfragebögen oder durch Technologieintegrationen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Für eine Zertifizierung im öffentlichen Sektor müssen beispielsweise die Sicherheitskontrollen überwacht, protokolliert und die Daten mindestens sechs Monate lang aufbewahrt werden, um nachzuweisen, dass alle Vorgaben erfüllt wurden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesetipp:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492583/cybersicherheitsabkommen-wie-internationale-security-frameworks-cisos-unterstutzen.html" target="_blank" title="Wie internationale Security Frameworks CISOs unterstützen"&gt;Wie internationale Security Frameworks CISOs unterstützen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tools-und-ressourcen-zur-untersttzung-der-einhaltung-von-vorschriften"&gt;Tools und Ressourcen zur Unterstützung der Einhaltung von Vorschriften&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Risikoregister sind hilfreich, um alle Beteiligten an einen Tisch zu bringen, indem sie alle Risiken dokumentieren und nach Prioritäten ordnen. Wenn alle Beteiligten die gleichen Informationen einsehen, können sie sich auf geeignete Maßnahmen einigen. Im Rahmen eines Risikomanagementprogramms werden Richtlinien, Standards und Verfahren regelmäßig überprüft und alle Änderungen vor ihrer Umsetzung genehmigt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mithilfe von Tools wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492710/governance-risk-compliance-grc-adaptiver-ansatz-fur-das-risk-management.html" target="_blank" title="Governance, Risk, and Compliance"&gt;Governance, Risk, and Compliance&lt;/a&gt; (GRC)-Systemen und kontinuierlicher Überwachung der Einhaltung von Vorschriften wie &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493537/neue-eu-it-security-richtline-nis-2-das-sollten-sie-beachten.html" target="_blank" title="NIS-2"&gt;NIS-2&lt;/a&gt; und ISO können Unternehmen laufende Sicherheitsaktivitäten verfolgen und die Ergebnisse melden. GRC-Systeme lassen sich mit &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492608/was-ist-siem.html" target="_blank" title="SIEM"&gt;SIEM&lt;/a&gt;-Lösungen verknüpfen, um Protokolle zu sammeln, durch die Kombination mit Schwachstellen-Scannern kann man nachzuweisen, dass Prüfungen durchgeführt wurden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zusätzlich zu solchen Instrumenten verlassen sich viele Unternehmen auf Dritte, um die Einhaltung der Vorschriften zu bewerten. Diese können vor einer externen Prüfung ein internes Compliance-Audit durchführen, um sicherzustellen, dass es keine Überraschungen gibt, wenn die Aufsichtsbehörden vorbeikommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="einmal-erfllen-auf-viele-anwenden"&gt;Einmal erfüllen, auf viele anwenden&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die meisten Unternehmen haben zahlreiche Compliance-Stellen, denen sie Rechenschaft ablegen müssen, sowie Cyberversicherungsanbieter, Kunden und Partner. Die Einhaltung von Vorschriften kann zwar eine Belastung sein, aber es gibt Techniken, um den Bewertungsprozess zu rationalisieren. Immerhin ist ein Großteil der gesetzlichen Anforderungen beinahe identisch. Orientieren sich CISOs beispielsweise an einem Rahmenwerk wie NIST, können sie überall die gleichen Verfahren anwenden. So sind zum Beispiel Anforderungen an das &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493543/was-ist-privileged-access-management.html" target="_blank" title="Privileged Access Management"&gt;Privileged Access Management&lt;/a&gt; (PAM) wie Passwortmanagement, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493978/multi-faktor-authentifizierung-etablieren-die-10-haufigsten-mfa-ausreden.html" target="_blank" title="Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung"&gt;Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung&lt;/a&gt; (MFA) und rollenbasierte Zugriffskontrollen in allen Compliance-Frameworks zu finden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ausblick"&gt;Ausblick&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letztlich ist die Einhaltung von Vorschriften ein fließender Bereich mit Anforderungen, die sich weiterentwickeln, um den sich ändernden Risikomustern und Geschäftsbedingungen Rechnung zu tragen. Es ist zu erwarten, dass die Sicherstellung der Compliance in Zukunft einen noch größeren Teil der Arbeit von CISOs ausmachen wird. Da die Branche mit immer größeren Bedrohungen konfrontiert ist, ist die Einhaltung von Vorschriften ein wichtiger Bestandteil eines strategischen und umfassenden Ansatzes für das Management von Cybersicherheitsrisiken.

      <title>The blind spot every CISO must see: Loyalty</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4127687/the-blind-spot-every-ciso-must-see-loyalty.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The longstanding assumption that tenure, performance metrics, or expressed commitment serve as reliable indicators of the trustworthiness of an employee persists across many sectors. Indeed, the great majority of personnel are loyal. But, while small, the percentage of those who aren’t is still well above zero.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this conflation of loyalty and security overlooks a fundamental reality: Loyalty is not a static trait, but a dynamic human response shaped by perceived fairness, personal circumstances, and organizational alignment. When grievances go unaddressed or external pressures mount, what appears as steadfast allegiance can quietly shift toward disaffection, resentment, or deliberate breaking of trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-half-century-of-observed-patterns"&gt;A half-century of observed patterns&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my more than 50 years of government, private sector, and journalistic endeavors, I have seen this pattern play out repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What begins as genuine commitment can erode under the weight of unmet expectations, financial strain, ideological differences, outside influences, or simply the passage of time in roles that demand constant vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The insider who once seemed beyond reproach becomes the very vector through which sensitive data, intellectual property, or operational integrity is compromised. These are not isolated failures of vetting or technology; they are failures to recognize that loyalty is relational and conditional, not absolute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-misread-appears-in-practice"&gt;How the misread appears in practice&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent examples illustrate the point. In the US federal sphere, abrupt terminations under workforce reduction initiatives have left former employees with lingering access to sensitive systems, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3831772/the-purging-of-us-workers-who-deal-with-secrets-has-created-a-spike-in-insider-risk.html"&gt;amplifying the potential for data exposure or retaliation&lt;/a&gt;. Corporate cases show a similar dynamic: engineers or executives who have spent years building institutional knowledge suddenly depart with proprietary information, motivated not by espionage but by opportunity or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These incidents are not anomalies. They reflect a broader pattern in which subjective judgments of loyalty, what I have come to call “personal barometers,” exist. For example, colleague to colleague, “Janet loves this company, she’s been here 20 years” may be a consensus view, yet it is not accompanied by objective, consistent, and transparent measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="personnel-history-blind-spots"&gt;Personnel history blind spots&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations have long operated under the belief that loyalty, once demonstrated, becomes a durable shield against insider risk. Extended tenure is rewarded with escalating access privileges, high performers are granted broader system rights without commensurate behavioral review, and verbal affirmations of commitment are taken at face value. Yet time and again patterns repeat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What begins as mutual confidence weakens not through dramatic betrayal but through subtle realignments in personal commitment. An employee who once identified strongly with the mission may begin to feel undervalued, overlooked for advancement, or weighed down by outside pressures. The organization, relying on its subjective gauge of past performance, fails to notice the change until the cow has bolted from the barn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These patterns are neither new nor rare. They reflect a systemic reluctance to treat loyalty as a living relationship that requires active maintenance and verification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-blind-spot-becomes-visible"&gt;The blind spot becomes visible&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today we have a confluence of forces that will expose the limitations of assumptive loyalty models. Economic volatility, including persistent inflation, ongoing AI-driven job displacements, and workforce reductions, will &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116983/insider-risk-in-an-age-of-workforce-volatility.html"&gt;heighten personal and professional stressors for employees at every level&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compounding the human element is the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109999/agentic-ai-already-hinting-at-cybersecuritys-pending-identity-crisis.html"&gt;rapid emergence of AI agents as autonomous insiders&lt;/a&gt;. These systems, granted privileged access to sensitive data and decision-making workflows, introduce risks at machine speed: prompt misdirection, goal misalignment, or unintended exfiltration without human intent or oversight. We know AI agents are among the fastest-growing insider vectors, with autonomous capabilities outpacing traditional controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Geopolitical tensions further amplify the threat. Nation-state actors and proxies increasingly exploit economic pressures and ideological divides to groom or coerce individuals, blurring the lines between personal discontent and hostile external influence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In critical sectors (transportation, finance, medical, energy) where elevated roles already receive greater scrutiny, the model proves resilient. Yet in less regulated environments, the absence of universal, consensual standards leaves organizations exposed. What was once a subtle misalignment becomes systemic exposure when human volatility meets machine autonomy and geopolitical opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="parallels-to-ai-poisoning-and-the-dual-crisis-of-trust"&gt;Parallels to AI poisoning and the dual crisis of trust&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These themes extend directly from an earlier column of mine, “&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4022073/ai-poisoning-and-the-cisos-crisis-of-trust.html"&gt;AI poisoning and the CISO’s crisis of trust&lt;/a&gt;.” That discussion examined how poisoned training data undermines the foundational integrity of artificial intelligence systems, creating a crisis of confidence in the tools organizations increasingly depend upon. The parallel to human loyalty is clear: Just as corrupted inputs erode the reliability of AI outputs, unexamined or misread human loyalties erode the reliability of the individuals who design, operate, protect, and rely on those systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both domains, reactive remediation is insufficient. Trust must be rebuilt through deliberate, continuous verification rather than periodic assumptions. The CISO’s crisis of trust is therefore dual: architectural in the machine domain and relational in the human domain. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4064326/coherence-insider-risk-strategys-new-core-principle.html"&gt;Coherence across these domains&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that human and machine behaviors remain aligned with organizational intent, then emerges as the essential principle for long-term resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-path-forward"&gt;The path forward&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The path forward lies in embracing consensual, tiered verification, where elevated responsibility demands greater scrutiny. Positions with access to crown jewels — sensitive data, financial systems, or personnel records — or executive ranks inherently require proportionately more oversight, as regulated sectors have shown. Professionals in these roles accept this as part of the terrain, with history demonstrating minimal talent loss when frameworks are transparent and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.opm.gov/suitability/suitability-executive-agent/suitability-training#url=Overview"&gt;Federal Trusted Workforce 2.0&lt;/a&gt; provides a vital blueprint for the private sector. By 2026, with full implementation across government agencies, this program enrolls millions in continuous vetting, using automated record checks to review a plethora of risks in real-time and reducing reliance on periodic reviews. Private adaptations are feasible and essential: secure releases from key personnel for ongoing monitoring, mirroring TW 2.0’s supportive ethos without federal mandates. These measures are far less expensive than the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567697/what-is-the-cost-of-a-data-breach-3.html"&gt;multimillion-dollar costs of a single malicious insider event&lt;/a&gt; ($4.9M to $13.9M per incident per IBM/Mimecast 2025 analyses).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Broader practices include pulse surveys and engagement tools to surface misalignment early, integrated HR reviews, and wellness interventions. &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-03-03-gartner-identifiesthe-top-cybersecurity-trends-for-2025"&gt;Gartner indicates AI-integrated behavioral programs&lt;/a&gt; reduce employee-driven incidents by 40%. These investments are economical, scalable, and consensual, fostering mutual trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The folly of equating loyalty with security must end. Through verifiable, human-centric vigilance, including consensual scrutiny scaled to responsibility, organizations can earn trust, not assume it, transforming vulnerabilities into resilience. In the era of &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/564201/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt;, there should be no pushback in the adoption of “trust but verify” personnel policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4064326/coherence-insider-risk-strategys-new-core-principle.html"&gt;Coherence: Insider risk strategy’s new core principle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>A large-scale law enforcement action, conducted within the Europol-coordinated operation Fabryka, led to the dismantling of a criminal network operating across the European Union. On Friday, 16 January, coordinated efforts took place in Poland, as well as in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. These actions targeted a network suspected of importing a large quantity of precursors used for the production of synthetic drugs in labs across multiple countries. Additionally, the network engaged in money laundering activities to further its illicit operations. The year-long operation Fabryka involved law enforcement and judicial authorities from Belgium, Czechia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain.</description>

      <title>Zscaler extends zero-trust security to browsers with SquareX acquisition</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128745/zscaler-extends-zero-trust-security-to-browsers-with-squarex-acquisition.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloud security company Zscaler has announced the acquisition of SquareX, a Singapore-based browser detection and response (BDR) technology startup. The deal will enable Zscaler to extend its Zero Trust Exchange capabilities directly into standard web browsers, across both managed and unmanaged devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), the company has been assisting enterprises adopt zero trust architecture using a lightweight agent. The SquareX &lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/press/zscaler-acquires-squarex#about-zscaler" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acquisition&lt;/a&gt; is expected to further strengthen Zscaler’s ability to deliver security directly within commonly used browsers through lightweight extensions, eliminating the need for a separate &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573875/secure-web-browsers-for-the-enterprise-compared-how-to-pick-the-right-one.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;enterprise browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The acquisition will assist in enabling posture-like security and protection against advanced spear-phishing and identity-based attacks right into the user’s existing workflow, stated Jay Chaudhry, CEO, chairman, and founder of Zscaler, in his LinkedIn post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="browsers-the-new-frontier-for-attacks"&gt;Browsers, the new frontier for attacks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally treated as a mere gateway to the internet, web &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101173/hardening-browser-security-with-zero-trust-controls.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;browsers&lt;/a&gt; are now at the center of enterprise activity, being widely used for SaaS applications, cloud services, and increasingly for generative AI tools. As employees upload, copy, and share sensitive data through browser sessions, this growing reliance has also opened new avenues for security risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most security stacks protect either the application, the endpoint, or the network. The browser is, unfortunately, the blind spot in between. There are traditional ways of dealing with the issue, but often at too great a risk, or as a result of too limiting an approach,” said Devroop Dhar, co-founder and MD at Primus Partners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquareX assists by allowing any browser on any device to function more like a secure enterprise browser using a lightweight, extension-based approach. “This extension becomes a kind of runtime enforcement agent, offering session-specific controls such as browser-based DLP, dynamic content isolation, real-time monitoring of user behaviour, and targeted security enforcement depending on risk levels and session context,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO and chief analyst at Greyhound Research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquareX’s approach also blocks sensitive data from being pasted into public AI tools, flags suspicious prompts, or limits interactions based on user role and data sensitivity, Dhar said. This is so important because AI misuse is rarely malicious, it is accidental. Browser-native security is better suited to prevent mistakes before they turn into incidents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquareX extension-based security can be integrated with most commonly used web browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari, allowing employees to continue using their preferred browser without requiring enterprises to deploy or manage yet another dedicated security tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-win-win-for-customers"&gt;A win-win for customers?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zscaler has acknowledged that browser runtime behaviour was a missing piece in its zero-trust security, and having SquareX solution in its portfolio can help fill the gap, noted Gogia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For Zscaler customers, this acquisition would mean browser security is no longer an afterthought or a separate tool to evaluate but a native part of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It reduces reliance on legacy access methods like VPN and VDI, especially for external users. It also gives Zscaler the ability to unify policy enforcement across network access, app usage, and now browser behaviour. Zscaler customers will be able to apply in-session controls to activities that were previously invisible, such as clipboard actions, extension behaviour, or AI prompt submission. They also gain options for session isolation, file download inspection, and least-privilege app access via browser,” added Gogia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for SquareX customers, this means scale and integration. Vivek Ramachandran, founder and CEO of SquareX, confirmed in a &lt;a href="https://sqrx.com/zscaler-acquires-squarex" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that customer deployments and investments will be protected, and over time, they will benefit from tighter integration with Zscaler services, expanded analytics, and more robust, risk-based controls across managed and unmanaged devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both instances, the customer benefits from improved alignment between access, behaviour, and enforcement approaches, stated Dhar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="different-roads-to-browser-security"&gt;Different roads to browser security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of late, leading cybersecurity companies have been strengthening their product portfolios by investing in and acquiring specialized browser security firms. This is an indication that they now see browser-native security as strategic rather than optional. For instance, in January this year, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4116703/crowdstrike-to-add-browser-security-to-falcon-with-seraphic-acquisition.html?utm=hybrid_search"&gt;CrowdStrike&lt;/a&gt; acquired Israel-based Seraphic Security, a browser runtime security company, which it plans to integrate into the Falcon platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For CISOs, the concern has shifted from the security of the browser to where the security of the browser should be located. Dhar explained in the case of Zscaler’s move with SquareX, the strategy is to integrate browser controls with its access component of Zscaler zero trust. That’s security beyond granting access. However, in the case of the acquisition by CrowdStrike involving Seraphic, the strategy falls under endpoint security as they extend the visibility of EDR solutions to include the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>CISA gives federal agencies 18 months to purge unsupported edge devices</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128748/cisa-gives-federal-agencies-18-months-to-purge-unsupported-edge-devices.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has given federal agencies 18 months to remove all end-of-support edge devices from their networks, escalating its response to what security researchers describe as a fundamental shift in nation-state attack tactics, where attackers exploit network infrastructure rather than endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-26-02-mitigating-risk-end-support-edge-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;binding operational directive&lt;/a&gt;, BOD 26-02, requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to inventory, update where possible, and ultimately replace firewalls, routers, VPN gateways, load balancers, and network security appliances that no longer receive vendor security patches. CISA warned that the threat from these unsupported devices is “substantial and constant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unsupported devices pose a serious risk to federal systems and should never remain on enterprise networks,” CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in the directive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The directive requires FCEB agencies to immediately update any edge device running outdated software to vendor-supported versions where possible.  Within three months, agencies must inventory all end-of-support devices using CISA’s EOS Edge Device List and report findings. Within 12 months, agencies must begin removing devices that have reached end-of-support dates. The 18-month deadline requires all unsupported edge devices to be permanently removed and replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-edge-devices-became-prime-targets"&gt;Why edge devices became prime targets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Edge devices differ fundamentally from traditional IT assets, as they are often end of support, custom, OEM and process dependent,” Avinash Dev Nagumanthri, director analyst at Gartner, told CSO. “This makes discovery, patching, and replacement difficult under tight budgets while maintaining uptime.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="Nation-state%20actors%20exploiting%20outdated%20firewalls%20and%20routers%20prompted%20the%20directive%20requiring%20agencies%20to%20inventory%20and%20replace%20unsupported%20network%20perimeter%20devices"&gt;Network edge devices&lt;/a&gt; have become one of the top initial access vectors for state-affiliated cyberespionage groups and ransomware gangs. Research shows a dramatic increase in edge device exploitation, with &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4031603/32-of-exploited-vulnerabilities-are-now-zero-days-or-1-days.html"&gt;network edge vulnerabilities seeing an 8x increase&lt;/a&gt; in exploitation activity. The &lt;a href="https://www.mandiant.com/m-trends"&gt;2025 Mandiant M-Trends report&lt;/a&gt; found that 21% of ransomware attacks featured vulnerability exploitation as the initial access vector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA has &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-239a"&gt;documented nation-state campaigns&lt;/a&gt; targeting devices from Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, Ivanti, Juniper, and other vendors. The agency noted that these devices have become attractive targets because of their position at the network boundary, integration with identity management systems, and privileged access for lateral movement. Once compromised, they enable threat actors to intercept network traffic, harvest credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data while evading traditional endpoint detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nagumanthri noted that edge devices protecting critical infrastructure can have physical impacts when compromised, putting high-value systems in sectors like water and transportation at risk. “Nation-state actors are increasingly exploiting edge devices as entry points into infrastructure, threatening critical private sector operations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The directive follows two recent emergency directives. In September, CISA issued &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-issues-emergency-directive-requiring-federal-agencies-identify-and-mitigate-cisco-zero-day" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Emergency Directive 25-03&lt;/a&gt; after threat actors exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances, deploying persistent malware that survived reboots. In October, &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/ed-26-01-mitigate-vulnerabilities-f5-devices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another emergency directive&lt;/a&gt; followed the compromise of F5 Networks’ development environment, where attackers exfiltrated BIG-IP source code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="implementation-hurdles"&gt;Implementation hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sunil Varkey, advisor at Beagle Security, warns of implementation complexities. “The operational reality of removing legacy systems is not straightforward,” Varkey said. “Legacy devices continue to exist not by design, but by necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed to orphaned systems that remain live and embedded in workflows but lack clear ownership, and operational technology environments where newer hardware or software versions are not available, compatible, or certified. The process requires asset discovery, risk assessment, procurement, configuration redesign, data migration, testing, and managed cutovers to avoid service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A common challenge will be the presence of ‘orphaned’ or ‘ghost’ systems — devices that are live, embedded in workflows, but no longer clearly owned,” Varkey said. “These systems often persist because ‘they’ve always worked,’ even when no one fully understands their function.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="private-sector-implications"&gt;Private sector implications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the directive applies only to federal civilian agencies, CISA strongly encourages private sector organizations to adopt similar measures. The exploitation campaigns targeting federal networks pose equivalent risks to critical infrastructure and commercial enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nagumanthri recommended that organizations treat edge and cyber-physical systems as Tier-0 assets, enforce strong authentication, implement network segmentation, require vendor-supported firmware updates, and centralize logging to limit blast radius. For the private sector, he advocated structured lifecycle management with secure-by-design hardware, continuous monitoring, and controlled updates with rollback capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Varkey saw the directive as a catalyst for modernization beyond compliance. “While the short-term impact will be challenging, the outcome is a more secure, accountable, and defensible infrastructure — one better aligned with today’s threat realities and tomorrow’s operational needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Ten career-ending mistakes CISOs make and how to avoid them</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128090/ten-career-ending-mistakes-cisos-make-and-how-to-avoid-them.html</link>

		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chief Information Security Officer role has become one of the most precarious positions in the C-suite. According to a Hitch Partners study, the average CISO tenure is &lt;a href="https://www.hitchpartners.com/ciso-security-leadership-survey-results-25" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;39 months&lt;/a&gt; — a timeframe that reflects the intense pressure and high stakes of the position. With &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3587236/77-of-cisos-fear-next-big-breach-will-get-them-fired.html" target="_blank"&gt;77% of CISOs&lt;/a&gt; fearing dismissal after a major breach, the margin for error continues to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IANS/Artico Search CISO Compensation Report reveals that turnover rates hit &lt;a href="https://www.asisonline.org/security-management-magazine/latest-news/today-in-security/2025/november/ciso-compensation/?locale=en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15% in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, up from 11% in 2024. Even a 6.7% compensation increase hasn’t slowed the exodus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO role has evolved from technical expert to strategic business executive — a shift many security leaders struggle to navigate. Rising personal liability under regulatory frameworks, persistent budget constraints, and an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape have converged to create an environment where even experienced CISOs find their positions at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This article examines the ten most common reasons CISOs lost their jobs in 2025 and provides mitigation strategies to help security leaders protect their positions. The data comes from recent industry research, including surveys of 550+ CISOs, analysis of security budget trends, and interviews with executive recruiters who’ve witnessed countless CISO departures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-failure-to-prevent-or-manage-major-breaches"&gt;1. Failure to prevent or manage major breaches&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most direct path to dismissal remains the inability to prevent or effectively respond to significant cybersecurity incidents. Organizations operate under a “one-throat-to-choke” mentality, and when a breach occurs, the CISO becomes the obvious target for accountability. According to &lt;a href="https://www.portnox.com/blog/security-trends/ciso-survey-c-suite-isnt-easy-street-for-security-leaders/#:~:text=data%20and%20systems.-,77%25%20of%20CISOs%20Worry%20a%20Data%20Breach%20Could%20Cost%20Them,to%20a%20more%20collective%20effort." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent data&lt;/a&gt; , 77% of CISOs believe a major breach will cost them their position.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High-profile incidents consistently result in leadership changes, regardless of whether the CISO had adequate resources or executive support before the incident.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy: &lt;/strong&gt;A comprehensive incident response plan with clear communication protocols and regular tabletop exercises forms the foundation of effective breach management. Documented risk assessments shared with the board create a paper trail that demonstrates due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When leadership understands the risks flagged by the security team and the resources requested, they’re less likely to assign blame to the CISO when incidents occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Poor communication with the board and C-suite&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technical expertise alone no longer suffices in the modern CISO role. Security leaders who fail to translate cyber risks into business impact quickly lose credibility with decision-makers who control budgets and strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When security leaders present endless technical details without connecting them to revenue loss, regulatory fines, or competitive disadvantage, boards tune out. This communication gap creates a dangerous disconnect where executives underestimate risks and underinvest in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lavonne Burke, VP of Legal, Global Security, IT &amp;amp; AI at Dell, succinctly framed the solution during the &lt;a href="https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/top-20-quotes-cyber-risk-virtual-summit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyber Risk Virtual Summit 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “CISOs must translate risk into a language the board understands. Instead of talking about encryption, explain how it prevents financial and reputational loss.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy: &lt;/strong&gt;Effective CISOs frame every security discussion in business terms. Rather than reporting “critical vulnerabilities,” they explain potential financial impact, customer trust erosion, and regulatory consequences. Dashboards that show risk trends and tie security metrics to business objectives the board already tracks prove far more effective than technical reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. Inadequate compliance and governance management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on research by &lt;a href="https://www.globalscape.com/resources/whitepapers/data-protection-regulations-study" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ponemon Institute and GlobalSCAPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, regulatory frameworks have evolved from guidelines to legal requirements with teeth. Non-compliance costs organizations 2.7 times more than maintaining compliance, and CISOs increasingly face personal liability under frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regulatory frameworks have evolved from guidelines to legal requirements with teeth. Non-compliance costs organizations 2.7 times more than maintaining compliance, and CISOs increasingly face personal liability under frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging AI regulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Meta (Facebook) &lt;a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;€1.2 billion GDPR&lt;/a&gt; fine serves as a sobering reminder that regulators impose penalties that materially impact business operations — and no company, regardless of size or market position, is exempt from enforcement. CISOs who treat compliance as a checkbox exercise put both their organizations and careers at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; A robust governance framework maps security controls to specific regulatory requirements. Detailed audit trails demonstrating due diligence, regular compliance assessments, and quarterly reports to the board on compliance posture create the documentation necessary to demonstrate organizational commitment to regulatory adherence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern password management solutions like &lt;a href="https://passwork.pro/?utm_source=foundry&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freemigration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Passwork&lt;/a&gt; provide the audit trails and access logs that compliance frameworks demand, giving CISOs concrete evidence of credential governance during audits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;4. Lack of business acumen and strategic alignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders who position themselves as cost centers rather than business enablers struggle to maintain executive support. In 2026, boards expect CISOs to understand how security decisions impact market share, customer acquisition, and competitive positioning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam Fletcher, CISO, Blackstone: “Cybersecurity isn’t about avoiding risk — it’s about managing it intelligently. The future belongs to leaders who make cyber resilience a competitive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When security becomes a barrier to business initiatives rather than a framework for safe innovation, executives start questioning the CISO’s value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders who can’t articulate how cybersecurity investments protect and enable revenue growth find themselves sidelined during strategic discussions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Successful CISOs develop a deep understanding of their organization’s business model, revenue streams, and competitive landscape. Early participation in product development discussions allows security leaders to offer guidance that accelerates rather than blocks initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Positioning security as a shared responsibility that enables business objectives transforms the function from cost center to strategic partner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;5. Weak password policies and credential management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Credential-based attacks remain one of the most common breach vectors, yet many organizations still rely on outdated password policies and inadequate credential management. When breaches trace back to compromised passwords, CISOs face difficult questions about why basic security hygiene wasn’t enforced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human error in password management creates cascading vulnerabilities. Employees reuse passwords across systems, share credentials through insecure channels, and store sensitive access information in plaintext documents. These practices create entry points that attackers exploit with alarming efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where modern enterprise password managers like Passwork become essential. By enforcing strong, unique passwords and providing a centralized vault, they directly address the root cause of many credential-based breaches. These solutions eliminate the friction that leads employees to adopt risky workarounds while giving security teams visibility into credential usage across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://passwork.pro/?utm_source=foundry&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freemigration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Enterprise password management solutions&lt;/a&gt; that combine strong password generation, secure sharing capabilities, and comprehensive audit trails address the root cause of credential-based breaches. Pairing this technology with clear policies and regular training builds a culture where credential security becomes second nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;6. High stress, burnout, and leadership fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 39-month average CISO tenure reflects more than just dismissals. Many security leaders resign under the weight of impossible expectations and relentless pressure. Research shows 84% of CISOs experience high stress levels, with &lt;a href="https://nominet.uk/news/nominet-ciso-stress-report-one-year-on/"&gt;48% reporting&lt;/a&gt; significant mental health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Burnout degrades decision-making quality, reduces strategic thinking capacity, and damages relationships with colleagues. When exhausted leaders become reactive rather than proactive, their performance suffers in ways that eventually lead to dismissal or resignation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy: &lt;/strong&gt;Establishing boundaries and delegating effectively protects against burnout. A strong security team capable of handling day-to-day operations allows the CISO to focus on strategic initiatives. Sustainable performance requires protecting mental health as vigilantly as protecting organizational systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;7. Budget mismanagement and failure to demonstrate ROI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security budgets face constant scrutiny, and CISOs who can’t build compelling business cases for investments struggle to secure necessary resources. When security spending appears disconnected from measurable outcomes, CFOs and boards question whether they’re getting value for their investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge intensifies when CISOs request budget increases after incidents occur. Executives reasonably ask why previous investments didn’t prevent the breach, creating a credibility gap that’s difficult to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy: &lt;/strong&gt;A risk-based budgeting approach quantifies potential losses from different threat scenarios, creating compelling business cases for security investments. Tracking and reporting metrics that demonstrate how security investments reduce risk exposure, prevent incidents, and enable business growth establishes clear ROI that resonates with financial decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When presenting budget requests, CISOs can point to concrete improvements like reduced credential-related incidents after implementing &lt;a href="https://passwork.pro/?utm_source=foundry&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freemigration"&gt;enterprise password management&lt;/a&gt; — measurable outcomes that CFOs understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;8. Insufficient staff training and cybersecurity culture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technology alone can’t secure an organization. When employees don’t understand their role in security or view it as someone else’s problem, even sophisticated defenses fail. CISOs who neglect culture-building create environments where security policies are circumvented rather than embraced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A divided security culture where different departments operate under inconsistent standards creates gaps that attackers exploit. When security feels like an impediment rather than a shared responsibility, employees find workarounds that introduce vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Effective security awareness programs go beyond annual compliance training. Engaging, role-specific education helps employees understand threats relevant to their work. Security champions in each department who advocate for best practices within their teams create a distributed defense model that scales across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;9. Overlooking insider threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While external attacks dominate headlines, insider threats represent a significant and often underestimated risk. Whether malicious or accidental, employees with legitimate access can cause devastating damage that’s difficult to detect and prevent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robust &lt;a href="https://passwork.pro/?utm_source=foundry&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freemigration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;password management solutions&lt;/a&gt; provide detailed audit trails that help identify unusual access patterns without invasive monitoring. When you can track who accessed what information and when, investigating potential insider incidents becomes significantly more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Least-privilege access controls limit employee access based on role requirements, reducing the potential impact of both malicious and accidental insider actions. Behavioral analytics identify anomalous activity patterns that warrant investigation. Comprehensive logs of sensitive data access, coupled with transparency about monitoring practices, balance security needs with employee trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10. Resistance to change and lack of innovation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat landscape evolves constantly, and CISOs who cling to outdated methodologies quickly become ineffective. In 2025, AI-driven attacks, quantum computing threats, and sophisticated social engineering require security leaders who embrace innovation rather than resist it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations implementing Zero Trust architectures, AI-powered threat detection, and cloud-native security models need CISOs who understand these technologies and can guide their adoption. Leaders who view new approaches with skepticism or who lack curiosity about emerging threats lose relevance rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigation strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous learning about emerging threats and security technologies keeps security leaders relevant in a rapidly evolving landscape. Industry conferences, peer networks, and relationships with vendors provide insight into coming innovations. A culture of experimentation within the security team encourages adaptation and prevents organizational stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Building a sustainable security leadership career&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO role continues to evolve from a technical position into a strategic business function that requires equal parts security expertise, business acumen, and leadership capability. Success in 2026 requires thinking beyond traditional security operations to become a business leader who specializes in security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The future belongs to security leaders who embrace proactive strategies, leverage modern tools like enterprise password managers to address foundational vulnerabilities, and position security as a business enabler.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Start with the basics: credential management remains one of the most exploited attack vectors, yet it’s also one of the most solvable problems. &lt;a href="https://passwork.pro/?utm_source=foundry&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freemigration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Passwork&lt;/a&gt; eliminates password-related risks while providing the audit trails and governance controls that compliance frameworks demand — giving CISOs both improved security posture and the documentation to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By addressing these ten common failure points systematically, you can build a sustainable career that survives the intense pressures of the modern CISO role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to address credential vulnerabilities in your organization?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://passwork.pro/?utm_source=foundry&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=freemigration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Passwork offers a zero-risk transition:&lt;/a&gt; free migration assistance and implementation, pay nothing while your current subscription runs — then get 20% off Passwork when you’re ready to switch.

      <title>Six more vulnerabilities found in n8n automation platform</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128998/six-more-vulnerabilities-found-in-n8n-automation-platform.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six more vulnerabilities have been discovered in the n8n workflow platform used for building LLM-powered agents to connect business processes. Four of the six are rated as critical, carrying CVSS severity scores of 9.4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These vulnerabilities span multiple attack classes, from remote code execution and command injection to arbitrary file access and cross-site scripting, all targeting a platform that is frequently deployed with access to secrets, credentials, internal APIs, and business-critical logic,” noted &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-genkin-48075b213/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amit Genkin&lt;/a&gt;, a security researchers at Israel-based cloud security provider Upwind,&lt;a href="https://www.upwind.io/feed/six-n8n-cves-one-day-workflow-security" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; who blogged about the vulnerabilities this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute, said the vulnerabilities affect how n8n sandboxes the processes created by different users, and how the host is protected from users with access to n8n.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is less of an issue for a single user system,” he said in an email, “but n8n is often installed in shared environments. Given the number and severity of the vulnerabilities, it is fair to assume that this is more or less just the ‘tip of the iceberg’. At this point, multi user n8n deployments should be treated with care.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery is the second major revelation of issues in the n8n platform this year. Four weeks ago, researchers at Cyera &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4113980/critical-rce-flaw-allows-full-takeover-of-n8n-ai-workflow-platform.html" target="_blank"&gt;published details of a critical vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, after it had been patched, that would allow unauthenticated attackers to completely take over n8n deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also last month, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4115417/malicious-npm-packages-target-n8n-automation-platform-in-a-supply-chain-attack.html" target="_blank"&gt;it was learned that threat actors are targeting n8n&lt;/a&gt; by planting malicious packages on the npm registry that claim to be legitimate n8n add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CSOs with n8n in their environments and developers using the platform should update to the latest version of the application to close the newly-found holes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerabilities are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-21893" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-21893&lt;/a&gt;, a command injection hole in the community edition of n8n. An unauthenticated user with administration permission could execute arbitrary system commands on the n8n host.&lt;br /&gt;“The risk is amplified by the trust typically placed in community extensions,” Upwinds said in its commentary, “making this a high-impact attack path that directly bridges application-level functionality with host-level execution.&lt;br /&gt;It carries a CVSS vulnerability score of 9.4;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25049" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25049&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse crafted expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system command execution on the host running n8n.&lt;br /&gt;“Because workflow expressions are a core and commonly used feature in n8n, this flaw significantly lowers the barrier to exploitation and enables full compromise of the underlying host,” commented Upwind in its blog;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25052" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25052&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. A vulnerability in the file access controls allows authenticated users with permission to create or modify workflows to read sensitive files from the n8n host system. This can be exploited to obtain critical configuration data and user credentials, leading to complete account takeover of any user on the instance;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25053" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25053&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 9.4. This is a vulnerability in the Git node that allows execution of system commands or arbitrary file access;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25051" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2026-25051&lt;/a&gt;, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the handling of webhook responses and related HTTP endpoints. It carries a CVSS score of 8.5. &lt;br /&gt;Under certain conditions, the n8n Content Security Policy (CSP) sandbox protection intended to isolate HTML responses may not be applied correctly. An authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse this to execute malicious scripts with same-origin privileges when other users interact with the crafted workflow. This could lead to session hijacking and account takeover.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61917" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-61917&lt;/a&gt;, which carries a CVSS score of 7.7. This is an information disclosure vulnerability caused by unsafe buffer allocation in n8n task runners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During an interview, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moshe-hassan-82290a155/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moshe Hassan&lt;/a&gt;, Upwind’s vice-president of research and innovation, estimated that 83% of his firm’s customers use the n8n platform. But, he added, less than 25% use it in production and/or may have it exposed to the web. The rest, he said, are testing it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, he said those who are evaluating the platform could be at risk if the users enter identity tokens for cloud platforms such as AWS and others as part of their testing. And the fact that large numbers of developers are testing the latest AI-related applications makes it hard for security pros to contain the blast radius of potential vulnerabilities in IT environments, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally, to contain vulnerabilities, CSOs have to understand the business logic and data flow of any applications in their environments, Hassan noted. However, risk can be lowered through network segregation, he said, and in addition, engineering should be allowed to create sandboxes for thorough testing of applications before they go into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Substack data breach leaks users’ email addresses and phone numbers</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128287/substack-data-breach-leaks-users-email-addresses-and-phone-numbers.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Substack, a high-profile publishing platform widely used by academics, journalists, subject matter experts, and controversialists, has suffered a data breach affecting an unknown number of its creators and subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to emails sent out this week to some users, on February 3 the company “identified evidence” that a third party had exploited an unspecified weakness in the company’s systems to gain access to user email addresses, phone numbers and, more vaguely, “other internal metadata.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach happened in October 2025, which means that data, which the company said did not include credit card numbers, passwords, or financial information, has been exposed for up to four months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have fixed the problem with our system that allowed this to happen. We are conducting a full investigation, and are taking steps to improve our systems and processes to prevent this type of issue from happening in the future,” &lt;a href="https://lorichristian.substack.com/p/notice-of-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said the email&lt;/a&gt; from Substack CEO Chris Best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We do not have evidence that this information is being misused, but we encourage you to take extra caution with any emails you receive that may be suspicious.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="no-passwords-to-lose"&gt;No passwords to lose&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time of publication, Substack had not yet made a web announcement about the breach, limiting itself to sending emails to users. This implies that the breach only affects a subset of its estimated 35 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the language of the email alert downplays the incident, describing the exposed data as merely being “shared without your permission.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that the breach was only discovered this week, after a four-month delay, raises the possibility that its scope could yet grow as Substack conducts deeper forensics. A &lt;a href="https://dailydarkweb.net/substack-data-breach-leads-to-leak-of-nearly-700000-records/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dark web source claimed&lt;/a&gt; the breach compromised 697,313 records, although this remains unconfirmed. It also reported that IDs from payment system Stripe, used by creators to receive payment from their subscribers, were compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the wording of the email alert sent by the company, the breach only affects users who have Substack accounts; anyone who subscribes to a Substack creator’s newsletter directly using an email address shouldn’t be affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full extent of what was exposed is less clear. In addition to email addresses and phone numbers, the company mentioned “metadata,” a catch-all term. In its &lt;a href="https://substack.com/privacy#:~:text=What%20Information%20does%20Substack%20collect" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, Substack describes a wide range of data this might include, depending on how the site is used, including user IDs, profile pictures, biographies, and IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How should Substack users react? Normally, the advice after any data breach is to change the account password. However, Substack’s default access method is &lt;a href="https://faq.substack.com/p/logging-in-to-substack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;via email address&lt;/a&gt;, with authentication confirmed by sending a “magic link” to the user’s email address. This removes the problem of password compromise and phishing attacks by not having a password to phish. If optional multi-factor authentication is turned on, the user must additionally enter a onetime code from an app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passwords are still possible — users who signed up before 2023 might have one — but in 2026, the user must actively choose to create one. The company doesn’t mention whether this subset of users should consider changing their passwords as a precaution, but did offer the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We cannot share specifics about our security systems and processes, but we can confirm that the issue has been resolved and safeguards have been put in place to help prevent this issue from happening again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Substack’s only other known security incident happened in 2020 when it &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack#:~:text=On%20July%2028%2C%202020%2C" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accidentally exposed&lt;/a&gt; user email addresses by adding them to the “cc” (carbon copy) field instead of the “bcc” (blind carbon copy) of an email when sending out a policy update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>New APT group breached gov and critical infrastructure orgs in 37 countries</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4128378/new-apt-group-breached-gov-and-critical-infrastructure-orgs-in-37-countries.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new cyberespionage group that operates out of Asia has compromised 70 government and critical infrastructure organizations across 37 countries over the past year using a sophisticated toolset that combines phishing, exploitation kits, custom malware, Linux rootkits, web shells, and a variety of other tunneling and proxy tools. Researchers believe the group is expanding its activities and is conducting active reconnaissance on even more targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Between November and December 2025, we observed the group conducting active reconnaissance against government infrastructure associated with 155 countries,” researchers from security firm Palo Alto Networks said in &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/shadow-campaigns-uncovering-global-espionage/"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto tracks the group as TGR-STA-1030 (aka UNC6619) and believes it is based in Asia based on language settings, its preference for regional tooling, GMT+8 operating hours, and targeting that aligns with events in the region. The researchers, who have been tracking the group since February 2025, believe it has ties to a nation state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group’s confirmed victims include national-level law enforcement and border control entities; ministries and departments of interior, foreign affairs, finance, trade, economy, immigration, mining, justice, and energy; elected officials and even a parliament’s infrastructure. The group has also targeted national telecommunications companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this group might be pursuing espionage objectives, its methods, targets, and scale of operations are alarming, with potential long-term consequences for national security and key services,” Palo Alto’s researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-phishing-to-exploits"&gt;From phishing to exploits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto started tracking the group a year ago following a series of phishing campaigns directed at European governments that the company dubbed the Shadow Campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing emails posed as announcements about organizational changes in official institutions and were written in the language of their intended targets. The messages contained links that led to the download of a ZIP archive with a custom malware loader the researchers now call Diaoyu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This loader performs various checks to detect the presence of certain antivirus programs and to ascertain whether it is running in a sandbox. It then proceeds to download the Cobalt Strike implant from a GitHub repository. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has grown popular among attackers over the years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the group hasn’t been observed exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities to gain access to networks, it has used exploits for known vulnerabilities (N-days) in a large number of software products, operating systems, and libraries, including: SAP Solution Manager, Microsoft Open Management Infrastructure, Microsoft Exchange Server, Pivotal Spring Data Commons, Struts2, Eyou Email System, Beijing Grandview Century eHR Software, Weaver Ecology-OA, Commvault CommCell CVSearchService, Zhiyuan OA, Microsoft Windows, networking products from Ruijieyi Networks and D-Link, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“On one occasion, we observed the actor connecting to e-passport and e-visa services associated with a ministry of foreign affairs,” the researchers said. “Because the server for these services was configured with Atlassian Crowd software, the actor attempted to exploit CVE-2019-11580, uploading a payload named rce.jar.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-complex-toolset-of-implants"&gt;A complex toolset of implants&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Cobalt Strike, the group uses various other malware payloads and command-and-control (C2) frameworks, including VShell, Havoc, SparkRat, and Sliver. On compromised web servers, the attackers deploy a variety of web shells, including Behinder, Neo-reGeorg, and Godzilla.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Linux servers the group has been seen deploying a rootkit dubbed ShadowGuard, which leverages the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), a powerful feature for running sandboxed code inside the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“eBPF backdoors are notoriously difficult to detect because they operate entirely within the highly trusted kernel space,” the researchers said. “eBPF programs do not appear as separate modules. Instead, they execute inside the kernel’s BPF virtual machine, making them inherently stealthy. This allows them to manipulate core system functions and audit logs before security tools or system monitoring applications can see the true data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ShadowGuard appears to be a tool that’s unique to this group and allows them to hide processes, files, and directories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conceal outgoing network traffic from victim networks, the attackers use a variety of relay and proxy servers running tunneling software like the GO Simple Tunnel (GOST), Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS), and IOX, but their C2 servers are typically hosted on virtual private servers (VPS) from the US, UK, and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="increase-in-targeting"&gt;Increase in targeting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto believes the group is expanding its operations because it has scanned networks of organizations from 155 countries for known vulnerabilities since October. The scans appear to be targeted on IP addresses belonging to government infrastructure and specific targets of interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, during the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4066008/government-shutdown-deepens-us-cyber-risk-exposing-networks-to-threat-actors.html"&gt;US government shutdown that began in October&lt;/a&gt;, the group started scanning the infrastructure of governments in the Americas, including in Brazil, Canada, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. The researchers believe the group has already compromised entities in Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group seems to time its targeting to certain events. For example, when the president of Czechia met with the Dalai Lama in August, the group immediately started scanning the computer infrastructure belonging to the Czech Army, police, parliament, and presidency, as well as its ministries of interior, finance, and foreign affairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“TGR-STA-1030 remains an active threat to government and critical infrastructure worldwide,” Palo Alto said. “The group primarily targets government ministries and departments for espionage purposes. We assess that it prioritizes efforts against countries that have established or are exploring certain economic partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company’s report includes indicators of compromise, including IP addresses, domain names, and file hashes for the implants used by the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
