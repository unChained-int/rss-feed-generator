      <title>FCC reversal removes federal cyber safeguards targeting telecom weaknesses post-Salt Typhoon attacks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094745/fcc-reversal-removes-federal-cyber-safeguards-targeting-telecom-weaknesses-post-salt-typhoon-attacks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US federal government is rolling back mandates intended to protect critical infrastructure following the widespread &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4048548/chinese-hacking-group-salt-typhoon-expansion-prompts-multinational-advisory.html" target="_blank"&gt;Salt Typhoon&lt;/a&gt; attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-415455A1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; a January 2025 Declaratory Ruling requiring US telecom providers to adopt and certify stricter cybersecurity measures. The ruling took effect under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which requires telecom providers and manufacturers to design their services and equipment in a way that allows for surveillance when legally requested by law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the reversal has been slammed by the FCC’s own commissioner, and security experts are looking askance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the cyber equivalent of hanging a ‘come kick me’ sign on critical infrastructure and national cyber security,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbshipley/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;David Shipley&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Beauceron Security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fcc-declaratory-ruling-unlawful-and-ineffective"&gt;FCC: Declaratory Ruling ‘unlawful and ineffective’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4047953/salt-typhoon-apt-techniques-revealed-in-new-report.html" target="_blank"&gt;Salt Typhoon attacks&lt;/a&gt;, disclosed in October 2024, have impacted some of the largest US communication companies, and countless others, with hackers accessing core systems used by the US government and potentially intercepting highly-sensitive information related to high-ranking officials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3805081/us-hits-back-against-chinas-salt-typhoon-group.html"&gt;January &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3805081/us-hits-back-against-chinas-salt-typhoon-group.html" target="_blank"&gt;Declaratory Ruling&lt;/a&gt; established legal obligations for telecom carriers to secure their networks against “unlawful access and interception,” underscoring that they are responsible for not only their equipment, but how they manage their networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision included a &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-408015A1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&lt;/a&gt; (NPRM) requiring telecom companies to create, update, and implement cybersecurity risk management plans, and certify them annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this week the FCC claimed that the Declaratory Ruling “misconstrued” CALEA, calling it “flawed,” and “unlawful and ineffective.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the agency, their action follows “months-long engagement with communications service providers” in which they have demonstrated a “strengthened cybersecurity posture” following Salt Typhoon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These providers have agreed to undertake “extensive, urgent, and coordinated efforts” to protect their networks against cyberattacks, mitigate operational risks, protect consumers, and preserve national security interests, according to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Commission added that it has taken “a series of actions” to harden communication networks and improve security. This includes establishing a &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/fcc-council-national-security" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Council on National Security&lt;/a&gt; that engages with security partners, and adopting targeted rules for critical infrastructure that don’t impose “inflexible and ambiguous requirements,” such as a mandate that submarine cable licenses only be granted after risk management plans are in place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, the FCC has banned “bad labs,” equipment-testing companies owned or controlled by foreign adversaries (notably China), from its equipment authorization program to ensure “no such entities are subject to untrustworthy actors that pose a risk to national security.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="salt-typhoon-still-reverberating"&gt;Salt Typhoon still reverberating&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salt Typhoon impacted major carriers including AT&amp;amp;T, Charter Communications, Consolidated Communications, Lumen Technologies, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Windstream. But law enforcement and intelligence agencies caution that its impact is far more widespread, exposing at least 200 US organizations, plus entities in 80 other countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to federal investigations, the attack allowed the Chinese government to record phone calls, geolocate millions of individuals, and target specific individuals including the US president and vice president. The group initially exploited the routers of telecom providers, using the devices and trusted connections to move into other networks and, among other actions, access information on wiretap systems used by federal law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salt Typhoon is “one of the worst cyberattacks in history,” &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/11/cantwell-slams-efforts-by-brendan-carr-s-fcc-to-roll-back-network-protection-rules-put-in-place-after-salt-typhoon-hacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said US Senator Maria Cantwell&lt;/a&gt;, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, who strongly opposed the ruling’s reversal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FCC &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/anna-gomez" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Commissioner Anna M. Gomez&lt;/a&gt;, the only FCC member who voted against the decision, &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-415409A1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noted that the move&lt;/a&gt; “will leave Americans less protected than they were the day the Salt Typhoon breach was discovered.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reversal-leaves-the-country-less-secure"&gt;Reversal ‘leaves the country less secure’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The January Declaratory Ruling was the “only concrete federal regulatory action” taken in response to the Salt Typhoon attack, she noted. The attempt by the Chinese-backed group will not be the last, she emphasized; in fact, without stronger security controls, it will also “not be the last successful one.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The FCC leaves the country less secure at the very moment when these threats are increasing,” said Gomez.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Senator Cantwell pointed out that the reversal has come after “heavy lobbying” to reverse it from the very telecom providers targeted by Salt Typhoon. She had previously demanded that CEOs at Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T document how they were remediating exploits that “deeply penetrated their networks,” but they have failed to provide this information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I am concerned that [the FCC] move to drop cybersecurity requirements on carriers is part of a pattern of weakness on national security issues,” Cantwell argued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beauceron’s Shipley was less measured in his criticism of the reversal. He called it “shockingly incompetent,” particularly in light of how much damage Chinese nation state hackers have done in the telecommunication sector over the past two years. Hopefully, Congress will step in, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he said, “I would struggle to find a dumber idea than rolling back the cyber security standards for telecommunications providers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>End of the game for cybercrime infrastructure: 1025 servers taken down</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/end-of-game-for-cybercrime-infrastructure-1025-servers-taken-down</link>
      <description>Between 10 and 14 November 2025, the latest phase of Operation Endgame was coordinated from Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. The actions targeted one of the biggest infostealers (Rhadamanthys), the Remote Access Trojan VenomRAT, and the botnet Elysium, all of which played a key role in international cybercrime. Authorities took down these three large cybercrime enablers. The main suspect for VenomRAT was also arrested in Greece on 3 November 2025.</description>

      <title>Root causes of security breaches remain elusive — jeopardizing resilience</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4093403/root-causes-of-security-breaches-remain-elusive-jeopardizing-resilience.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-incident analysis remains a critical concern at most security organizations today. According to Foundry’s Security Priorities study, 57% of security leaders report their organization struggled to find the root cause of security incidents experienced in the past year, leaving them at heightened risk of getting breached again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts tell CSO the finding underscores that the immediate pressure to firefight often leaves post-incident learning under-resourced. Organizations need to treat &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4009438/how-to-conduct-an-effective-post-incident-review.html"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt; as a continuous learning cycle, not a one-time clean-up exercise if they are to reduce the likelihood of repeat breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations are stuck in a reactive cycle, focusing solely on containing the immediate breach, which comes at the expense of a crucial forensic investigation, leaving the ‘patient door’ wide open for the next attacker to walk right back in,” &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/authors/dray-agha"&gt;Dray Agha&lt;/a&gt;, senior manager of security operations at managed security response firm Huntress, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a thorough postmortem to pinpoint the root cause, companies are essentially defending themselves blindfolded, destined to repeat the same mistakes,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="resilience-through-root-cause-analysis"&gt;Resilience through root cause analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts agree that too many enterprises treat incident response as an operational exercise rather than an analytical one. As a result, containment and recovery actions might be well-rehearsed while deeper forensic investigation and post-incident learning lag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without a disciplined approach to evidence preservation and &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/350219/what-is-root-cause-analysis-a-proactive-approach-to-change-management.html"&gt;root cause analysis&lt;/a&gt;, valuable insights are lost,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-moore-724212/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Tom Moore&lt;/a&gt;, director of digital forensics and incident response at managed security services vendor BlueVoyant. “Robust incident response isn’t just about getting systems back online — it’s about using lessons learned to inform detection, prevention, and risk mitigation strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moore adds: “That continuous feedback loop ultimately drives long-term resilience and is particularly valuable when the cyber threat landscape is evolving and adapting so quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariehargraves/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Marie Hargraves&lt;/a&gt;, principal crisis management consultant at cloud security vendor Semperis, agrees that “most organizations focus on fighting fires instead of learning from the flames.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every crisis has three phases: detection, response (the acute phase), and review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the third phase, the post-crisis review, where resilience is built,” Hargraves says. “Organizations that capture real-time data, analyze it rigorously, and act on lessons identified recover faster and emerge stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Incident response isn’t just about surviving; it’s about adapting and building resilience,” Hargraves adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tracing-an-attack-path"&gt;Tracing an attack path&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Preparation is key, so businesses need to have dedicated tools and skills for digital forensics in place before an incident occurs through technologies such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/524286/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management-explained.html"&gt;security incident and event management (SIEM)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/566677/12-top-siem-tools-rated-and-compared.html"&gt;SIEM devices&lt;/a&gt; are important because, for example, many gateway and VPN devices have a local storage that overwrites itself within hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If a cybercriminal breaks in through the VPN and dwells for a day or so before they pivot to business-critical servers, then the VPN telemetry has evaporated into the abyss,” Huntress’ Agha explains. “The centralization and retention of VPN logs, like through a SIEM, allows for reactive detections but also stores valuable data and allows for root cause analysis to figure out how the initial breach [occurred].”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statistics from Huntress show that near 70% of sophisticated cybercriminals break in through the VPN. “Where SIEM has been enabled, we are able to catch them much earlier in their attack path, but also deploy retrospective analysis to identify the exact root cause that led to the breach,” Agha says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various services such as &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573533/top-12-managed-detection-and-response-solutions.html"&gt;managed detection and response (MDR)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574295/11-top-xdr-tools-and-how-to-evaluate-them.html"&gt;extended detection and response (XDR)&lt;/a&gt; can also include forensic capturing software — technology that enables providers to work hand in hand with forensic cyber investigators to identify the source of the breach and work to remediate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without tools such as this, trying to work back retrospectively to identify the ‘how’ becomes increasingly difficult,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-derbyshire-48291b25/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Rob Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at cybersecurity firm Securus Communication. “There are companies that offer incident response services when breaches occur, but the key to sorting it quickly, and preventing it from happening again, is ensuring you already have the tooling and processes to make any response significantly slicker.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eclecticiq.com/eclecticiq-intelligence-research-team-arda-b%C3%BCy%C3%BCkkaya"&gt;Arda Büyükkaya&lt;/a&gt;, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at EclecticIQ, points out that without thorough root-cause analysis the “actual cause of the attack remains unknown and potentially still active.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Best practices should include digital forensics expertise, root cause analysis processes, and threat intelligence integration to connect incidents to broader attacker tactics and campaigns,” Büyükkaya advises. “This approach allows organizations to build resilience from every incident.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="robust-planning"&gt;Robust planning&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An incident response team, typically led by the CISO, should be designated to take charge during an incident. The plan should also specify roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder, from IT staff to legal advisors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts quizzed by CSO say an incident response playbook boils down to a few key steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt; Maintain a tested incident response plan, clear roles, and escalation paths.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection and analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Centralize monitoring, leverage threat intelligence, and ensure forensic capability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containment and recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Act fast but preserve evidence; validate systems before restoration.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postmortem:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct structured reviews, document findings, and feed them into security architecture and training.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate threat modeling, automate containment, and invest in skills development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many organizations opt to use established frameworks and ISO standards as templates for their incident response plans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These frameworks offer a structured approach, providing sections and subsections that cover all essential areas, from governance to technical responses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-ford-a4026421/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Richard Ford&lt;/a&gt;, CTO at Integrity360. “By using a recognized framework, you not only ensure completeness but also facilitate easier communication with external parties who may be familiar with the framework.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-organizational-resilience"&gt;Building organizational resilience&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective incident response should be geared toward building a structured, repeatable, and intelligence-driven process that strengthens resilience over time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incident response plans should be regularly tested, refined, and updated — for example, through simulations or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570871/tabletop-exercises-explained-definition-examples-and-objectives.html"&gt;tabletop exercises&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a wider business continuity and organizational resilience strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharat-mistry-952414/?originalSubdomain=uk"&gt;Bharat Mistry&lt;/a&gt;, field CTO at cybersecurity vendor Trend Micro, says many organizations suffer from a maturity gap in their incident response — which should extend beyond simply containment and recovery to encompass forensic analysis and postmortems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When organizations bypass root cause analysis, they are only treating symptoms,” Mistry warns. “This challenge stems from a combination of issues: fragmented visibility due to siloed tools that prevent accurate attack reconstruction, a skills gap that leaves teams short on forensics and threat hunting expertise, and process weaknesses where postmortems are often informal or simply skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="breaking-the-cycle-of-breach-patch-repeat"&gt;Breaking the cycle of ‘breach, patch, repeat’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, evidence is inadvertently destroyed, such as when servers are wiped, logs are lost, and forensic trails disappear, because the emphasis is on restoring operations quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is compounded by pressure from the business, time constraints, as well as limited resources, which push teams to move on to the next urgent task rather than learning from the incident,” Mistry adds. “As a result, retrospective scans, root cause analysis, and updates to procedures are frequently skipped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial attack vector and lateral movement often remain unknown, leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed and creating a cycle of “breach, patch, repeat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To break this cycle, organizations must embed forensic readiness into their response strategy: preserve evidence, conduct structured postmortems, and ensure lessons learned are fed back into security architecture and training,” Mistry concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bot w Skull 16z9 v2 " class="wp-image-4084812" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lerbank-bbk22_shutterstock_2367007649_16z9.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;KI-Risiken zu bewerten und zu quantifizieren, ist in der GenAI-Ära unerlässlich.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;Lerbank-bbk22 | shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie jede Technologie birgt auch künstliche Intelligenz (KI) nicht nur Vorteile. Insbesondere seit dem Aufkommen von Generative AI (&lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/2821922/was-ist-generative-ai.html" target="_blank" title="GenAI"&gt;GenAI&lt;/a&gt;) und der explosionsartigen Verbreitung entsprechender Tools und Lösungen ist es für Unternehmen wichtiger denn je, die Risiken &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492643/generative-aieine-neue-herausforderung-fur-den-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen"&gt;in Zusammenhang mit KI zu kennen&lt;/a&gt;. Entsprechend steht das Thema GenAI bei Rechts-, Compliance- und Datenschutzverantwortlichen &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-12-13-gartner-says-legal-compliance-and-privacy-leaders-rank-rapid-generative-ai-adoption-their-top-issue-in-the-next-two-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="einer Gartner-Umfrage"&gt;einer Gartner-Umfrage&lt;/a&gt; zufolge in den nächsten zwei Jahren ganz oben auf der Agenda.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um KI-Risiken entgegenzuwirken, neue Bedrohungen zu minimieren sowie Compliance und Datenschutz zu gewährleisten, müssen Anwenderunternehmen ihr KI-Engagement gründlich bewerten, Risiken abwägen und Richtlinien sowie Strategien &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492417/ki-vs-mensch-der-aufstieg-des-ai-ciso.html" target="_blank" title="definieren"&gt;definieren&lt;/a&gt;. Die Bewertungsstrategien unterscheiden sich dabei je nach Art der eingesetzten KI-Lösung. Ganz allgemein lassen sich die Risiken in Zusammenhang mit der Technologie in drei Kategorien einteilen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;interne KI-Projekte,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;KI-Lösungen von Drittanbietern sowie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;schadhafter KI-Einsatz durch Bedrohungsakteure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Folgenden nehmen wir die einzelnen Bereiche ausführlich unter die Lupe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="interne-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Interne KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um Risiken bewerten zu können, müssen Unternehmen im ersten Schritt wissen, wie künstliche Intelligenz intern eingesetzt wird. Um das zu bewerkstelligen, bieten sich zwei Möglichkeiten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Softwareunternehmen Abbyy bewertet und quantifiziert die Performance seiner KI-Modelle schon seit einigen Jahren. Dafür verwendet das Unternehmen Frameworks für Risiko- und Qualitätsmanagement – unter anderem das &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="ISO Risk Management Framework"&gt;ISO Risk Management Framework&lt;/a&gt;. Spezielle Risikomanagement-Frameworks für künstliche Intelligenz werden derzeit erarbeitet – sowohl &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in den USA"&gt;in den USA&lt;/a&gt; als auch &lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/de/policies/regulatory-framework-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="in Europa"&gt;in Europa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Warum Abbyy für seine internen GenAI-Projekte in erster Linie auf ältere Frameworks setzt, erklärt Andrew Pery, AI Ethics Evangelist beim KI-Softwarespezialisten, folgendermaßen: “Diese Frameworks sind noch sehr rudimentär. Es ist noch zu früh, sie zum Einsatz zu bringen. Unser Kernprodukt extrahiert Daten und Inhalte aus Dokumenten und wir haben spezifische Genauigkeitsziele für unsere traditionellen KI-Modelle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut einer &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/state-of-ai-report-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wiz-Untersuchung"&gt;Wiz-Untersuchung&lt;/a&gt; von 150.000 Public-Cloud-Accounts kommen in 70 Prozent der Cloud-Umgebungen inzwischen Generative-AI-Dienste zum Einsatz. Die beliebteste KI-Plattform ist dabei mit 53 Prozent die von OpenAI. Dicht gefolgt von Hugging Face und anderen Open-Source-Projekten. Diese Plattformen zu nutzen, birgt für Unternehmen diverse Risiken, beispielsweise mit Blick darauf, dass eingegebene Daten für das KI-Modelltraining verwendet werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein umfassender Überblick darüber, welche KI-Lösungen wo zum Einsatz kommen, ist deshalb unerlässlich. Laut Priya Iragavarapu, VP of Technology Services bei der Unternehmensberatung AArete, erfordert das sowohl einen Top-Down- als auch einen Bottom-Up-Ansatz: “Unternehmensentscheider sollten Prozesse, bei denen KI beteiligt ist, überprüfen und mit dem KI-Governance-Team &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496105/governance-als-losung-genai-zwischen-akzeptanz-und-verbot.html" target="_blank" title="diskutieren"&gt;diskutieren&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn die Führungskräfte nicht wissen, welche KI wo verwendet wird, kommt der Bottom-up-Ansatz ins Spiel: Alle Endpunkte im Unternehmen werden getrackt, um die Systeme und Benutzer zu finden, die auf KI-Anwendungen zugreifen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das stelle keine perfekte Lösung dar, gibt die Beraterin zu: “Es gibt immer noch Dinge, die unter den Tisch fallen. Aber an dieser Stelle kommt der Aspekt einer gründlichen Schulung beziehungsweise Weiterbildung ins Spiel, um Mitarbeiter vor selbstverschuldeten &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3577944/diese-unternehmen-hats-schon-erwischt.html" target="_blank" title="Dummheiten"&gt;Dummheiten&lt;/a&gt; zu bewahren.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Eigene AI Deployment Frameworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen sollten auch ein Framework dafür aufsetzen, wie KI-Modelle im Sinne ihrer jeweiligen Compliance-Umgebung und Risikotoleranz eingesetzt werden. So könnten etwa einige Anwendungsfälle erfordern, dass sämtliche KI-Outputs manuell überprüft werden müssen. “Es gibt mehrere Risikodimensionen, die für generative KI relevant sind”, erklärt Iragavarapu. “Wie viele Menschen sind davon betroffen? Wie groß ist der Impact?” AArete arbeitet mit einigen Unternehmen zusammen, um sie dabei zu unterstützen, diese Risiken zu messen. Für einige Branchen existieren auch bereits erste Generative-AI-Risiko-Benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist ein Bereich, auf den sich jetzt diverse Beratungsunternehmen konzentrieren – Ernst &amp;amp; Young zum Beispiel hat einen “&lt;a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ai/platform/our-approach" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Confidence Index"&gt;AI Confidence Index&lt;/a&gt;” entwickelt. Kapish Vanvaria, Risk Markets Leader bei EY Americas, erklärt, was es damit auf sich hat: “Unser Vertrauensindex basiert auf fünf Kriterien – Datenschutz und Sicherheit, Bias und Fairness, Verlässlichkeit, Transparenz und Erklärbarkeit und schließlich die Verantwortlichkeit. Das ist die eine Achse des Indexes. Die andere umfasst Compliance und ethische Grundsätze. So lässt sich eine Heatmap der verschiedenen Prozesse erstellen und eine gewichtete Bewertungsmethode auf jeden einzelnen anwenden.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich Recht und &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3496124/cloud-security-journey-wie-compliance-bei-accenture-geht.html" target="_blank" title="Compliance"&gt;Compliance&lt;/a&gt; seien diese Berechnungen relativ einfach, weil sie auf Scoring-Werten basierten. In anderen gebe es hingegen mehr Ermessensspielraum, so der EY-Entscheider: “Ein Unternehmen könnte beispielsweise den Reifegrad anhand von Faktoren wie einer Richtlinie zur akzeptablen KI-Nutzung bewerten. Sie können numerische Punktzahlen anwenden, um die Grundlinien zu messen, und wenn sich das Ziel verändert entsprechende Änderungen vornehmen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="drittanbieter-ki-risiken-bewerten"&gt;Drittanbieter-KI-Risiken bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsprobleme in Zusammenhang mit Drittanbieter-Services sind &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492170/third-party-risk-management-5-wege-mit-drittanbietern-unterzugehen.html" target="_blank" title="nicht neu"&gt;nicht neu&lt;/a&gt;. Potenziell könnte jeder Anbieter – egal, ob es um E-Mail-, Marketing- oder Daten-Services geht – Zugriff auf sensible Daten haben und diese unter Umständen sogar an seine jeweiligen Partner weitergeben. Risiken dieser Art zu minimieren, war schon vor Generative AI eine Herausforderung für Unternehmen – jetzt haben die Sicherheitsentscheider und ihre Teams gar keine andere Wahl mehr, als &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494219/chatgpt-und-co-was-cisos-beim-einsatz-von-genai-beachten-sollten.html" target="_blank" title="wachsam zu sein"&gt;wachsam zu sein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schließlich könnten Tools, die bislang nicht als Sicherheitsrisiko galten, etwa für die Bildbearbeitung, inzwischen über GenAI-Funktionalitäten verfügen – die hochgeladenen Informationen also bei einer KI landen. Um das zu verhindern, müssen in erster Linie sämtliche Verträge und Nutzungsbedingungen genau studiert und im Auge behalten werden. Darüber hinaus kann ein dediziertes Risikomanagement-Team für Drittanbieter dazu beitragen, Risiken zu minimieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Notch, CISO beim Security-Anbieter Expel, hat noch einen Tipp auf Lager, wenn es darum geht, die Zeichen am Horizont zu deuten: “Wenn ein Anbieter intern neue KI-Funktionen entwickelt, kann eine Änderung seiner Datenschutzrichtlinie ein erster Hinweis darauf sein. Bleiben Sie wachsam!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In diesem Zusammenhang entfaltet auch die europäische Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) positive Wirkung. Sie verpflichtet Anbieter dazu, offenzulegen, wenn sie mit Subunternehmern zusammenarbeiten. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="externe-ki-bedrohungen-bewerten"&gt;Externe KI-Bedrohungen bewerten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative KI wird längst auch zu unlauteren Zwecken genutzt, etwa um &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495991/google-prognose-2024-genai-verstarkt-phishing-kampagnen.html" target="_blank" title="(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren"&gt;(Spear)-Phising-Emails zu generieren&lt;/a&gt;. Das stellt die Sicherheitsteams in Unternehmen zunehmend vor Probleme, wie CISO Notch konstatiert: “Jede Organisation will sich vor Business E-Mail Compromise schützen. Allerdings sind die Indikatoren dafür, dass es sich um eine nicht koschere E-Mail handelt, sowohl für Menschen als auch für Maschinen immer schwieriger zu erkennen. Künstliche Intelligenz ist in der Lage, E-Mails und Webseiten nahezu perfekt zu fälschen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perys Arbeitgeber Abbyy arbeitet deswegen gezielt mit Sicherheitsanbietern zusammen, die sich auf GenAI-Bedrohungen spezialisiert haben. Dennoch sind die KI-Risiken schwer zu quantifizieren. An dieser Stelle sollen künftig neue Frameworks Abhilfe schaffen – etwa die vom Cybersecurity-Experten Daniel Miessler 2023 veröffentlichte “&lt;a href="https://danielmiessler.com/p/the-ai-attack-surface-map-v1-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="AI Attack Surface Map"&gt;AI Attack Surface Map&lt;/a&gt;“. Sasa Zdjelar, Chief Trust Officer beim Supply-Chain-Spezialisten ReversingLabs, rechnet damit, dass demnächst auch größere Organisationen nachziehen: “CISA, NIST, die Cloud Security Alliance, ENISA und andere werden spezielle Task Forces bilden, die sich mit diesen neuen Bedrohungen befassen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bis es soweit ist, können Unternehmen prüfen, wie gut sie die Grundlagen beherrschen. Dazu gehört beispielsweise, zu überprüfen:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle Endpunkte geschützt sind;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ob alle User Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung nutzen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie gut die Mitarbeiter Phishing-Versuche erkennen;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;wie groß der Rückstand in Sachen Patching ist;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;zu welchem Grad &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491851/was-ist-zero-trust.html" target="_blank" title="Zero-Trust-Prinzipien"&gt;Zero-Trust-Prinzipien&lt;/a&gt; die IT-Umgebung abdecken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese grundlegenden Hygienemaßnahmen können leicht unter den Tisch fallen, wenn neue Bedrohungen auftauchen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus können Firmen auch hinsichtlich neuer und aufkeimender Threats tätig werden, wie Sean Loveland, COO vom Sicherheitsanbieter Resecurity, nahelegt: “Offensive Cyber Threat Intelligence und KI-spezifisches Threat Monitoring können Informationen über neue Angriffsmethoden und Schwachstellen liefern sowie darüber, wie diese monetarisiert werden. Es gibt zum Beispiel ein Produkt namens ‘FraudGPT’, das über das Dark Web und Telegram vertrieben wird.” Dass kriminelle Hacker KI-Tools inzwischen&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492536/chatgpt-wie-cybergangster-generative-ai-nutzen.html" target="_blank" title=" in erheblichem Umfang nutzen"&gt; in erheblichem Umfang nutzen&lt;/a&gt;, kann auch Greg Stewart, Vice President Artificial Intelligence bei SentinelOne, bestätigen: “Wir beobachten eine starke Zunahme von adaptiver und polymorpher Malware, die sich autonom verbreitet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Davon abgesehen ist GenAI jedoch auch in der Lage, das Angriffsvolumen drastisch zu steigern. Das Weltwirtschaftsforum identifiziert in seinem “&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Global Risks Report 2024"&gt;Global Risks Report&lt;/a&gt;” ein weiteres, erhebliches Risiko für Unternehmen: KI-generierte Fehl- und Desinformationen. Schließlich können sich entsprechende Fake News schnell drastisch auf den Aktienkurs eines Unternehmens auswirken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="risikobehaftete-aussichten"&gt;Risikobehaftete Aussichten&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Unternehmen müssen sich darauf konzentrieren, einen ganzheitlichen Plan zu erstellen, um den Stand der generativen KI in ihrem Unternehmen zu bewerten”, hält Paul Silverglate, Technology Leader bei Deloitte USA, fest. Er ergänzt: “Sie müssen zeigen, dass es für das Unternehmen wichtig ist, es richtig zu machen und darauf vorbereitet zu sein, schnell zu reagieren und Abhilfe zu schaffen, falls etwas passiert.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wie wahrscheinlich es ist, dass das genau so und zeitnah passiert, ist mit Blick auf eine &lt;a href="https://riskonnect.com/reports/new-generation-of-risk-ahead-of-the-curve-or-behind-the-pack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Riskonnect-Survey"&gt;Riskonnect-Survey&lt;/a&gt; unter 300 Risiko- und Compliance-Entscheidern fraglich:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;93 Prozent der Unternehmen rechnen mit erheblichen Bedrohungen im Zusammenhang mit generativer KI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennoch geben nur 17 Prozent der Teilnehmer an, das gesamte Unternehmen in Bezug auf GenAI-Risiken geschult oder informiert zu haben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lediglich neun Prozent sind nach eigenen Angaben darauf vorbereitet, diese Risiken zu managen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine ähnlich gelagerte ISACA-Umfrage unter mehr als 2.300 Fachleuten aus den Bereichen Audit, Risiko, Sicherheit, Datenschutz und IT-Governance kommt darüber hinaus zum Ergebnis, dass lediglich zehn Prozent der Befragten über eine umfassende &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494657/windows-sicherheit-meets-generative-ai-sind-ihre-richtlinien-schon-ki-ready.html" target="_blank" title="Generative-AI-Richtlinie"&gt;Generative-AI-Richtlinie&lt;/a&gt; verfügen. Noch schlimmer: Mehr als ein Viertel der Befragten plant auch nicht, eine solche zu entwickeln. Gravierende Fehler, wie Silvergate erklärt: “Trust ist &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495889/verbesserungswurdige-compliance-masnahmen-generative-ai-konnte-das-vertrauen-der-kunden-untergraben.html" target="_blank" title="der heilige Gral"&gt;der heilige Gral&lt;/a&gt;. Wenn Sie das Vertrauen ihrer Kunden verlieren, wird es sehr schwer zurückzugewinnen sein.” (fm)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The CISO’s greatest risk? Department leaders quitting</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094734/the-cisos-greatest-risk-department-leaders-quitting.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a familiar refrain: too much work and not enough compensation and recognition. Yet, while CISOs have seen their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3626973/cisos-embrace-rise-in-prominence-with-broader-business-authority.html"&gt;role grow in prominence and responsibility&lt;/a&gt;, the same cannot be said of functional security leaders who are being asked to do more — but are not reaping the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, this is causing increased job dissatisfaction with career progression and more readiness to exit. For CISOs, this presents a significant risk: If midlevel security managers feel overburdened and under-recognized, the ripple effects can undermine resilience, continuity, and innovation. At a time when cyberattacks continue to grow increasingly more sophisticated and trickier to remediate, CISOs cannot risk &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3998246/53-of-cyber-department-leaders-eyeing-the-exit.html"&gt;functional leader defection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“An increased expectation is being placed on functional cyber leaders because they are not only being asked to protect systems but also enable business outcomes — all while managing new regulatory demands, complex technology stacks, and limited resources,’’ says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carol-lee-hobson/"&gt;Carole Lee Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of PayNearMe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes an expanded attack surface with cloud, SaaS, and AI, leaving functional cyber leaders accountable for risks in their third-party dependencies they can’t fully control, Hobson notes. “Combine that with the 24/7 nature of the job and hybrid work environments, and it’s no surprise burnout is escalating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some 66% of cybersecurity professionals say their role is more stressful now than five years ago, with 63% citing the complex threat landscape as their top stressor, according to ISACA’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.isaca.org/state-of-cybersecurity"&gt;State of Cybersecurity Report&lt;/a&gt;. Further, more than half (55%) of cybersecurity teams are understaffed, and 65% have unfilled cybersecurity positions, the survey found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="systemic-issues-continue"&gt;Systemic issues continue&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trend of talented and dedicated functional security leaders quietly eyeing the exit is not an anomaly — it’s a predictable outcome of systemic issues that have been building within the profession for years, says &lt;a href="https://centricconsulting.com/team/brandyn-fisher/"&gt;Brandyn Fisher&lt;/a&gt;, V-CISO capability lead at Centric Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As CISOs, we are seeing our most critical layer of management, our directors and senior managers, burn out,’’ Fisher says. “This isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s the result of a dangerous convergence of unrealistic expectations, resource starvation, and a fundamentally broken career model.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders operate on an unsustainable premise, Fisher says. “We expect our leaders to be right every single time, while an attacker only needs to be right once. This creates a culture of hyper-vigilance that is simply not sustainable 24/7/365.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teams are expected to be on-call through holidays and weekends, often without commensurate pay, and because a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3829440/managing-the-emotional-toll-cybersecurity-incidents-can-take-on-a-team.html"&gt;major incident can mean a four- to six-week response&lt;/a&gt;, personal lives are put on hold, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/monika-malik/"&gt;Monika Malik&lt;/a&gt;, lead data/AI software engineer at AT&amp;amp;T, doesn’t hold back on why functional leaders may be looking to defect. Too often, they are held accountable for projects, yet not given autonomy to make roadmap, staffing, and budget decisions, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Security leaders experience burnout when they own the risk and have no roadmap,’’ Malik says. On top of that, there is chronic stress and “breach panic, pager fatigue, and breach aftermath dumpster fires, [which] lead to burnout quicker than compensation can mitigate,’’ Malik says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fisher agrees: “This immense pressure is compounded by a lack of control. A security leader is often the scapegoat for failures originating elsewhere in the organization — a single clicked link by a user, a vulnerability pushed by a development team, or a poor decision by a high-level executive.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Functional security leaders are held accountable for defending against threats within environments where they have limited visibility, he says. This means they are “fighting an invisible war on behalf of stakeholders who often don’t understand the stakes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another issue is &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2515727/6-tips-for-consolidating-your-it-security-tool-set.html"&gt;tool creep&lt;/a&gt;, with 40-plus security tools managing the same alerts and poor integrations, Malik says. There is also “role overload and context switching” on projects, as well as relentless audit cycles, reviews, and meetings, which Malik says leaves little time for career development. “Many organizations have a CISO plus a flat layer of ‘heads of X’” who don’t always have a clear path to moving into higher levels, she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And CISOs are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2092097/are-you-a-toxic-cybersecurity-boss-how-not-to-be-a-badly-behaved-ciso.html"&gt;constantly asking their leaders to do more with less&lt;/a&gt;, Fisher adds. “As cybersecurity is still widely viewed as a cost center rather than a business enabler, budgets are the first to be slashed while the threat landscape grows exponentially,’’ he says. “This places managers in the impossible position of being responsible for mitigating enterprise-level risk without the necessary funding for tools or talent.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-cisos-can-and-should-be-doing"&gt;What CISOs can and should be doing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The situation isn’t hopeless; there are steps CISOs can and should take to help avoid defections. It’s a matter of making staff a priority. PayNearMe’s Hobson says CISOs need to ask themselves whether functional security leaders are wearing too many hats with too few opportunities to advance, and if they are &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015173/how-cisos-are-training-the-next-generation-of-cyber-leaders.html"&gt;doing enough to nurture&lt;/a&gt; and retain them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CIOs should be asking tough questions about leadership pipelines, succession planning, and the cultural dynamics within their security teams,’’ she says. “If we want to build sustainable security leadership, we need to understand — and address — why so many are eyeing the exit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retention should be thought of as a program that requires additional operating model iterations, rather than something static, according to Malik. She suggests that CISOs implement a &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/287088/project-management-how-to-design-a-successful-raci-project-plan.html"&gt;responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI)&lt;/a&gt; project management tool and give functional security leads authority over their systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They should also be given career paths that include promotions rubrics and “sponsorship — not mentorship — at the executive level, with visibility and board-facing opportunities,’’ Malik says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A portion of compensation should be tied to risk contributions, for example, stats for time to patch, instead of audit fail/success factors, she adds. There also needs to be “tool and telemetry sanity,” which would require CISOs to consolidate vendors and implement a “quarterly kill-switch: If your tool is not reducing MTTR/false positives by date and tool objectives … retire or re-scope the tool as per worst-case expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Centric Consulting’s Fisher thinks success should be tracked by prevention of downtime and system protection, rather than reacting to an incident. At one company he worked at, when the security team started posting data on risk reduction on its dashboards, engagement increased and turnover declined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It increased the visibility of work, which renewed the motivation within teams,’’ he says, adding that it is not often security professionals will leave due to pressure. “They abandon due to the disappearance of their results behind the lack of crisis.” They would more likely feel invested if prevention was used as a metric, Fisher says, “and make security a quantifiable growth aspect rather than an unspoken background role.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-ciso-role-something-to-aspire-to"&gt;Is the CISO role something to aspire to?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asking functional leaders to do more “is a direct reflection of the CISO’s own struggle for influence,” Fisher observes. When a CISO sits under an &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567355/6-signs-the-cio-ciso-relationship-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it.html"&gt;unreceptive CIO or COO&lt;/a&gt; and does not have a seat at the executive table, they cannot effectively advocate for their team’s needs, he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This powerlessness trickles down. Managers are left to enforce policy and execute on a strategy they had no input on, with a team that is understaffed and under-equipped for the task,’’ Fisher says. “They carry the responsibility for failure without the authority or resources to ensure success.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most critical issue is that “ambitious security managers are looking up the ladder and &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4016334/has-ciso-become-the-least-desirable-role-in-business.html"&gt;seeing a role they do not want&lt;/a&gt;,’’ he adds. “They see their CISO, buried in a 24/7 cycle of stress, personally liable without the same protections as other executives, and struggling to find time for the strategic thought leadership the role demands.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is that many see a leadership bottleneck, Fisher says. He believes there is a propensity to promote the best technical experts into the CISO role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While their hands-on experience is valuable,” he acknowledges, “many lack the strategic perspective, business acumen, and leadership skills to build a mature security program and mentor the next generation of leaders. For the aspiring manager who wants to grow into a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4080670/what-does-aligning-security-to-the-business-really-mean.html"&gt;business-aligned strategist&lt;/a&gt;, this creates a career ceiling. Why stay and fight an uphill battle for a midlevel salary that doesn’t match the required experience, only to report to a leader who cannot pave the way for meaningful career progression?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Career progression in cybersecurity likely needs to be redefined, Hobson agrees. “It’s not just about climbing a narrow ladder toward the CISO role — there are limited seats at that level, and the field is evolving too quickly for that to be the only path.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are “multiple rewarding paths beyond the traditional CISO path,’’ she says, in areas including AI governance, architecture, and risk. Lateral growth through deep specialization in areas like privacy, threat modeling, and AI governance can be just as valuable and fulfilling, Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="help-functional-leaders-see-meaning-in-their-work"&gt;Help functional leaders see meaning in their work&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prevent an exodus, CISOs must fundamentally shift their focus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not enough to recognize that functional leaders are overextended, Hobson says. “CISOs need to restructure workloads, prioritize development, and empower their teams to influence the organization strategically,” she says. “The high-stress role needs to be balanced with professional engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Malik, Hobson says CISOs should also “&lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/405251/the-art-of-delegating-6-tips-for-it-leaders.html"&gt;delegate meaningfully&lt;/a&gt;” to prevent burnout and give functional leaders real autonomy. “Nothing burns out a strong leader faster than being reduced to a messenger.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO’s role is to cultivate resilience, belonging, and knowledge in different pathways so leaders see meaning in their work and remain engaged, Hobson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That starts with clarity — helping functional leaders understand how their responsibilities directly support business strategy and reinforcing that security should be a strategic advantage for every company,’’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our primary job is not just to manage risk, but to build a resilient, sustainable organization,’’ Fisher stresses. “That begins with protecting our people from burnout, championing the business value of security in the boardroom to secure necessary resources, and actively mentoring our managers into becoming the strategic leaders this industry needs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
