      <title>Coach or mentor: What you need depends on where you are as a cyber leader</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099036/coach-or-mentor-what-you-need-depends-on-where-you-are-as-a-cyber-leader.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/renee-guttmann/"&gt;Renee Guttmann&lt;/a&gt;, a Fortune 50 CISO who has served at Time Warner, Coca-Cola, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and other global organizations, gives back by helping others advance along their CISO career paths. Early in her own career, there were no seasoned CISOs to guide her. That motivates her to mentor professionals both within cybersecurity and those looking to enter the field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had mentors early in my career, especially as my teams grew and my interactions with senior executives increased,” she says. “The key message is that it’s okay to ask for help. It’s not a sign of weakness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a September ISSA LA meeting, Guttmann and one of her mentees presented to a full room about mentoring and coaching, sharing personal experiences. “Attendees could have gone to other sessions, but they chose ours. Why? Because the need in our industry is so great,” she explains. “Executive coaching and mentoring are common in other fields — so why not in cybersecurity?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the session, she outlined the distinction between mentoring and coaching and why professionals may need both at different stages of their careers. Mentoring, she says, is typically a one-on-one relationship focused on sharing real-world experience. During COVID-19, for example, she helped a mentee address an employee secretly working two jobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With another mentee, she recognized the need for improved executive presence and recommended working with a coach. Guttmann faced a similar challenge early in her own career, and her CIO arranged for her to receive executive coaching. Her coach recommended books, facilitated role-playing sessions, and even encouraged her to take a two-day acting class to build confidence in delivering difficult news.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-to-find-coaches-and-mentors"&gt;Where to find coaches and mentors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many potential mentees connect with Guttmann through networking events or professional platforms like LinkedIn. She also participates in formal mentoring programs, including one that involved twenty mentees and ten prominent cybersecurity executives. It has monthly 90-minute training sessions and additional one-on-one meetings. These conversations often focus on career advancement and navigating sensitive workplace situations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some mentees find mentors within their own organizations. Others connect through industry-specific IT groups in sectors such as healthcare, energy, or government. Professional organizations including IANS and Deloitte also offer mentoring and coaching programs designed to help CISOs build the business acumen necessary for board-level engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the growing demand, Guttmann expects executive recruiters to also begin partnering with experts to develop formal mentoring and coaching services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a mentor, she evaluates whether her experience aligns with a mentee’s needs and ensures the relationship is built on trust, respect, and confidentiality. Mentors and mentees typically meet monthly via videoconference, creating a safe environment to discuss peers, employees, HR issues, and leadership challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once mentees meet their goals, formal meetings conclude — ideally with the mentee eventually “paying it forward.” For example, one of Guttmann’s former mentees is already establishing a mentoring program within their own organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-good-technical-base-can-last-decades"&gt;A good technical base can last decades&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While mentees need the most help with aligning to the business, some argue that a technical baseline is equally as important to the role for managing technical staff and enabling business operations, particularly through innovative technologies like cloud and AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of those is &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-madden-841121161/"&gt;Cynthia Madden&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Artemis Enterprise. “The well-rounded CISO needs an equal balance of technical and business acumen,” she explains. “For example, if a new technology brings specific business risks with it, the CISO needs to understand how to meet the business objective within the business’s approved risk tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, Madden found most of her mentors in the workplace. Her first mentor (a “brilliant” technologist from MIT) helped her understand the basics of neural networks and how to interact with them programmatically. She used her core programming skills in Visual Basic with ODBC to connect to his neural network to predict inventory for a pharmaceutical company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under this apprenticeship, she learned how to bridge the needs of the business, inventory expirations, and manage costs — in that case using an early form of artificial intelligence. That mentorship proved to be valuable thirty years later for assessing AI adoption capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She found more technical mentors when she pivoted to government, where she applied her masters in cybersecurity to conduct cyber exercises and testing against missile defense facilities. There, too, she felt more technically mentored. But she also learned about mission, responsibility, chain of command, ethics, and more business-related knowledge that serves her today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those government mentors were enduring. For me, mentoring people in cyber space is about an extended relationship over time. It’s a trust position to do that, both in the government and private sector. So those become many years-long relationships,” Madden explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of all the things she found mentors for, she needed the most direction around balancing her strong sense of ethics with her employers’ ethics, especially when employers put profits over people. For that, she’s currently in a coaching program learning to balance these nuances in a healthy, informed way by building paths where both people and profit thrive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And she pays it forward through her classroom mentoring program, “Girls in Cyber,” on Oahu in her home state of Hawaii, where she helps girls in grades four through twelve build technical skillsets that may someday serve as a baseline for their own leadership roles in cyber.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="becoming-a-business-leader"&gt;Becoming a business leader&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For mentees from technical backgrounds to grow they ultimately need to step away from their hands-on technical roles and learn executive leadership. But letting go of control is often the most difficult step for would-be CISO’s to make, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgegerchow/"&gt;George Gerchow&lt;/a&gt;, CSO at Bedrock Data. As a long-time faculty member at IANS, he’s seen this often while working one-on-one with CISO’s (as well as through classroom instruction) under the IANS CISO &lt;a href="https://www.iansresearch.com/what-we-do/professional-development/ciso-executive-coaching"&gt;executive coaching program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At some point, they’ve got to let go of that technical role in order to step into different business roles and grow,” Gerchow notes. “The reason why so many CISOs don’t get board seats is because they lack understanding of the way a business works, including its strategic positioning and the business longevity plan.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his own CISO roles at Sumo Logic and MongoDB, Gerchow had direct access to the board, which gives him valuable experience to share in his trainings. To that end, Gerchow feels more like a mentor than a coach. “I love working with people who are up and coming, looking to brand themselves and get into different positions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also mentored many people in his former workplaces. As he prepared to leave Sumo Logic, he mentored his deputy CISO by putting his “feet in the fire.” He worked with the deputy CISO to create documentation for the board, hold staff meetings, and co-present to the board. “Automating myself out of a job – to me that’s mentoring. Coaching, on the other hand, is more about goal setting and planning a career path. Both are equally needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mentoring-is-about-the-what-while-coaching-is-about-the-how"&gt;Mentoring is about the ‘what’ while coaching is about the ‘how’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like others, Upen Sachdev, principal partner at Deloitte, rose from the technical ranks to direct security, compliance and risk management for a large global brand, after which he was a CISO for seven years at another large global brand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sachdev found help with mentors as he ascended in his career. But while working with clients at Deloitte, he saw a gap in business leadership skills among what he calls the “next generation of CISOs.” So he helped create Deloitte’s &lt;a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/programs/chief-information-officer/services/ciso-program-offerings-resources.html"&gt;CISO program&lt;/a&gt; with his peers, which Deloitte offers at no cost to selected candidates from the Deloitte client base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mentors will show you the light because they have walked the path before. They will tell you what to do, which mountain to climb,” he says. “Our job as coaches is to help them understand the how. How do you improve your storytelling skills? How can you have a better executive presence? How do you lead your leaders? And how do you enable the business?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the program’s nearly 100 alumni, most of them now rock their executive-level roles. They’re expanding their networks and paying it back, he says. “Our community wants to give back, invest time, connect with, listen to, and support people in advancing in their careers,” Sachdev says. “In some ways, they’ve also coached me back. They’ve made me a better listener, a better teammate, and hopefully a better human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>From feeds to flows: Using a unified linkage model to operationalize threat intelligence</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4100422/from-feeds-to-flows-using-a-unified-linkage-model-to-operationalize-threat-intelligence.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-problem-static-intelligence-in-a-dynamic-world"&gt;The problem: Static intelligence in a dynamic world&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every CISO knows the fatigue that comes with modern threat intelligence. Dozens of vendor feeds pour in daily — STIX packages, IP blocklists, domain indicators, malware hashes — all claiming to help your organization stay one step ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet most threat feeds still behave like spreadsheets of badness. They tell you &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to watch for, but not &lt;em&gt;why it matters&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;how it moves&lt;/em&gt; through your environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a paradox of abundance: CISOs have more data than ever before, but less operational clarity. Analysts are overwhelmed by indicators disconnected from context or mission relevance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each feed represents a snapshot of a potential threat, but it does not capture the dynamic pathway through which that threat could exploit relationships within the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional intelligence products describe discrete artifacts; real-world attacks exploit linkages amongst users and cloud services, between supply-chain vendors and data repositories, between identity providers and DevOps pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shift from threat feeds to threat flows requires a model that can describe those linkages, quantify their trustworthiness and prioritize risk based on how threats actually travel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where the &lt;a href="https://www.uscybersecurity.net/csmag/unified-linkage-models-recontextualizing-cybersecurity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unified Linkage Model (ULM)&lt;/a&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rhizomatic-networks-and-the-modern-attack-surface"&gt;Rhizomatic networks and the modern attack surface&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Classical network defense models assume hierarchical systems — servers at the core, clients at the edge and clear boundaries in between. But digital enterprises no longer look like trees; they behave more like &lt;em&gt;rhizomes&lt;/em&gt; — living systems of lateral, recursive connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rhizomatic network, a term from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Deleuze and Guattari’s &lt;em&gt;A Thousand Plateaus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and explored in this context elsewhere, is one where any node can seemingly connect to almost any other, directly or indirectly, through APIs, shared identity layers or multi-cloud infrastructure. In these environments, roots have become less permanent and topologies have become less predictable. Within this landscape, dependencies emerge dynamically and relationships evolve faster than documentation can keep up. This shift from hierarchy to rhizome changes the way we know how threats propagate. A compromise in one SaaS tenant can ripple laterally through adjacent cloud accounts, CI/CD pipelines or shared identity providers with surprising speed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers no longer exploit static perimeters — they weaponize &lt;em&gt;relationships&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uscybersecurity.net/csmag/rhizomatic-threats-in-practice-applied-cybersecurity-modeling-for-emergent-threat-landscapes/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The ULM provides a structured way to visualize this chaos.&lt;/a&gt; By mapping three core linkage types — adjacency, inheritance and trustworthiness — the ULM reveals how risk moves rhizomatically through complex ecosystems. It transforms modern network entanglement into something quantifiable, allowing CISOs to reason about propagation rather than static exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-unified-linkage-model-ulm"&gt;The unified linkage model (ULM)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ULM was conceived initially to describe how cyber risk propagates through interdependent systems — not merely by asset or vulnerability, but by &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt;. Instead of seeing networks as linear hierarchies, ULM views them as living ecosystems where risk flows along three primary linkage types:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjacency linkages&lt;/strong&gt;: Proximity or shared interfaces between systems, such as network segments, APIs or shared infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inheritance linkages: &lt;/strong&gt;Dependencies and configuration flows, such as a compromised library in a build pipeline or inherited IAM policies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uscybersecurity.net/csmag/establishing-trustworthiness-an-adaptive-governance-approach/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trustworthiness linkages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Human or contractual relationships, such as vendor access, federated identities or service-to-service tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each linkage represents a potential &lt;em&gt;path of exploitation&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than treating each threat artifact in isolation, ULM maps how those artifacts connect — showing how an attacker could traverse from an initial compromise point to an ultimate target through adjacency, inheritance and trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This concept reframes threat intelligence from &lt;em&gt;collection&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;. In the ULM view, the organization’s environment is not simply a list of assets but a graph of interactions. Threats are not isolated incidents but &lt;em&gt;flow across linkages&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-feeds-to-flows-building-a-living-threat-graph"&gt;From feeds to flows: Building a living threat graph&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine receiving a feed that reports a malicious IP address associated with a phishing campaign. In most SOCs, that indicator enters a SIEM rule or firewall blocklist — a transactional act of defense. The intelligence stops there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now apply ULM thinking:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The malicious IP is associated with a compromised third-party marketing tool.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;That tool has API keys embedded in your marketing automation system.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The automation platform uses OAuth tokens that connect to your corporate CRM.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The CRM is integrated with your cloud identity provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each linkage forms part of a &lt;em&gt;threat flow&lt;/em&gt; — a connected chain of potential exploitation that moves laterally through business processes, not just through ports and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By mapping linkages, the CISO can see that the “malicious IP” is not an isolated data point; it’s the first observable in a multi-stage flow that touches customer data, credentials and identity infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When threat intelligence is structured as linkages, not lists, analysts can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlate faster:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify shared infrastructure or behavior patterns across feeds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize better&lt;/strong&gt;: Focus on threats that intersect with high-value or high-trust linkages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predict earlier&lt;/strong&gt; by anticipating propagation through modeling adjacent or inherited dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;threat feeds become threat flows&lt;/em&gt; — intelligence with direction, momentum and consequence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="operationalizing-ulm-in-threat-intelligence-pipelines"&gt;Operationalizing ULM in threat intelligence pipelines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-ingest-and-normalize"&gt;1. Ingest and normalize&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ULM begins by ingesting diverse threat feeds — commercial, open-source, government and internal telemetry. Each artifact (IP, domain, hash, tactic or technique) becomes a &lt;em&gt;node&lt;/em&gt; in the linkage model, enriched with metadata such as MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK techniques, timestamps or confidence scores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-establish-linkages"&gt;2. Establish linkages&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system identifies relationships between nodes using multiple criteria:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjacency:&lt;/strong&gt; Shared IP ranges, ASN or cloud hosting; shared libraries or API keys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inheritance:&lt;/strong&gt; Supply-chain dependencies, build-system components or configuration drift.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trustworthiness:&lt;/strong&gt; Credential sharing, federated SSO connections, vendor contracts or known trust relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Linkages are scored for strength and directionality — similar to weights in a graph — producing a threat-linkage graph showing how a compromise could cascade across systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-integrate-with-mitre-attck-and-tips-and-fair"&gt;3. Integrate with MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK and TIPs and FAIR&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ULM aligns naturally with &lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK’s&lt;/a&gt; technique-level data.Each linkage can be annotated with the ATT&amp;amp;CK tactics it enables — from &lt;em&gt;Initial Access&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Impact&lt;/em&gt;. Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms such as MISP or ThreatConnect allows ULM graphs to update dynamically as new indicators appear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A previously benign linkage can instantly become high-risk when connected to a newly malicious node, turning static intel into a living, breathing operational map.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the &lt;a href="https://www.fairinstitute.org/blog/extending-fair-unified-linkage-model-strengthens-cyber-risk-quantification-1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ULM bridges quantitative risk frameworks like FAIR and FAIR-CAM&lt;/a&gt; by embedding linkage dynamics into loss-event modeling, thereby enabling risk assessments not only of the magnitude of loss but of the &lt;strong&gt;pathway through which loss may propagate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-visualize-threat-flows"&gt;4. Visualize threat flows&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visualization is key. And in the emerging environment of AI/ML models and cloud-based resources, this visualization can occur. Using ULM, CISOs can see attack pathways as flow diagrams rather than spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A connection to a compromised supplier’s GitHub repo (inheritance linkage)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ injects code into a shared container image (adjacency linkage)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;→ which is deployed into production through an automated pipeline (trust linkage).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such visualizations reveal choke points where a single control — code-signing enforcement or identity segmentation — can break multiple flow paths at once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ulm-as-a-bridge-between-intelligence-and-authorization"&gt;ULM as a bridge between intelligence and authorization&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the persistent frustrations in enterprise security is the divide between intelligence and governance. Threat feeds inform SOCs; frameworks like NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2, ISO/IEC 27001:2022 or the CMMC 2.0 Model govern compliance. The two rarely meet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ULM provides the connective tissue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because ULM formalizes relationships between systems, it can feed directly into risk management frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/03/28/vickie_nist_risk_management_framework_overview-hpc.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST RMF Step 1–2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Categorize/Select controls):&lt;/strong&gt; Use ULM to identify linkage-dense areas where compromise would have the highest propagation potential.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3–4 (Implement/Assess):&lt;/strong&gt; Validate that controls exist along key linkages — authentication boundaries, code-inheritance chains, vendor access.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6 (Monitor):&lt;/strong&gt; Continuously refresh linkages with new threat intel, transforming continuous monitoring into continuous linkage validation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In compliance contexts, ULM metrics — such as linkage density, trustworthiness scores and adjacency exposures — become measurable inputs for CMMC maturity, ISO 27001 risk registers or &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/207/final" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zero Trust Architecture (SP 800-207)&lt;/a&gt; policy enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A threat flow, therefore, is not only a technical visualization but an auditable artifact of due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="zero-trust-and-the-flow-perspective"&gt;Zero trust and the flow perspective&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zero trust architecture (ZTA) is often summarized as “never trust, always verify,” as formalized in NIST SP 800-207. ULM adds nuance by showing &lt;em&gt;what to verify&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;where trust actually exists.&lt;/em&gt; Every trust boundary in a zero-trust design corresponds to one or more linkages in ULM:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user authenticating through an identity provider — &lt;em&gt;a trustworthiness linkage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A microservice calling another via API — &lt;em&gt;an adjacency linkage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A software update pipeline pulling from a third-party repo — an &lt;em&gt;inheritance linkage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When threat intelligence is mapped onto those linkages, the CISO gains real-time visibility into which trust paths are under active threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of treating zero trust as a static segmentation map, ULM enables a &lt;em&gt;dynamic trust model&lt;/em&gt; — continuously updated by threat-flow data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach converts zero trust from an architectural goal to an operational feedback system. Each linkage is verified not only against access policies but also against active threat flows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ciso-use-case-prioritizing-by-linkage-impact"&gt;CISO use case: Prioritizing by linkage impact&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider two simultaneous alerts:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A phishing domain targeting the finance department.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A compromised API key in a DevOps integration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both seem essential, but which deserves immediate attention?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A traditional feed-based approach might treat them equally. The ULM view quickly shows that the API key sits on a high-trust, high-inheritance linkage — it connects the build system to production containers and those containers share adjacency with customer data stores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing domain, by contrast, leads to isolated user inboxes with strong controls. By quantifying the linkage weight, the CISO can prioritize the DevOps compromise, knowing that its flow potential — the ability to move from one system to another — is far higher. This is attack-path prioritization, not just vulnerability management. It is the difference between chasing every indicator and focusing on the flows that matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toward-a-flow-based-defense"&gt;Toward a flow-based defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams often describe their posture in terms of &lt;em&gt;perimeters&lt;/em&gt;, boundaries, &lt;em&gt;endpoints&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;controls&lt;/em&gt;. But adversaries don’t think in boxes — they believe in flows. They exploit the connective tissue: the forgotten trust token, the unmonitored CI/CD handoff, the shared SaaS credential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ULM provides a way to think and act like an attacker while maintaining the analytical rigor of a defender. By modeling linkages, CISOs can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualize attack surfaces:&lt;/strong&gt; Understand not just what assets exist, but how they relate to each other.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantify propagation risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure how fast and far a compromise could move.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operationalize threat intel: &lt;/strong&gt;Feed dynamic linkage updates into monitoring and response playbooks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align intelligence with compliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Demonstrate to auditors and boards that risk is understood &lt;em&gt;in context&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, adopting ULM doesn’t require replacing existing tools. Most organizations already possess the data — network maps, identity graphs, vulnerability scanners and threat feeds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ULM unifies them into a linkage framework, transforming siloed outputs into a coherent risk narrative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-cisos-call-to-action"&gt;The CISO’s call to action&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, we have been trained to collect — logs, indicators, feeds. The next era of cybersecurity requires that we understand connections: how elements interact, inherit and propagate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By adopting a linkage mindset, CISOs can elevate threat intelligence from reactive to predictive. The ULM provides the analytical bridge between static data and dynamic defense — a means to see threats not as isolated alerts but as &lt;em&gt;flows of intent&lt;/em&gt; moving through digital ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The message is simple but powerful:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop simply reading threat feeds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start mapping threat flows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is how you operationalize threat intelligence in the age of rhizomatic, interconnected systems — and how CISOs finally gain the visibility to act, not just react.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional details are available in my original research paper:  &lt;a href="https://www.uscybersecurity.net/csmag/unified-linkage-models-recontextualizing-cybersecurity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unified Linkage Models: Recontextualizing Cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; (United States Cybersecurity magazine).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI creates new security risks for OT networks, warns NSA</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101239/ai-creates-new-security-risks-for-ot-networks-warns-nsa.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security of operational technology (OT) in critical infrastructure has been a recurring theme for years, but this week the US National Security Agency (NSA) and its global partners added a new concern to the mix: how the increasing use of AI in OT risks making things worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scope of these concerns, and guidance for addressing them, is outlined in the &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/03/2003834257/-1/-1/0/JOINT_GUIDANCE_PRINCIPLES_FOR_THE_SECURE_INTEGRATION_OF_AI_IN_OT.PDF" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Principles for the Secure Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Operational Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; authored by the NSA in conjunction with the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) and a global alliance of national security agencies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the use of AI in critical infrastructure OT is in its early days, the guidance reads like an attempt by the NSA and its partners to get ahead of the problem before misuse or misapplication becomes entrenched. Although drafted for OT admins, the guidelines mirror concerns that also apply to IT administration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, AI is being put to work in OT networks in the energy, water treatment, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors for the same reason it is being used elsewhere: to optimize and automate processes, thereby improving efficiency and uptime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worry is that organizations are jumping into a new and far from battle-hardened technology without assessing its limitations, echoing what has been happening in IT. &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3485728/why-ot-cybersecurity-should-be-every-cisos-concern.html" target="_blank"&gt;Measuring risk&lt;/a&gt; against the industrial control systems (ICS) &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Enterprise_Reference_Architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Purdue Model hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;, the guidelines enumerate worries such as adversarial prompt injection and data poisoning, data collection leading to reduced safety, and “AI drift” in which models become less accurate as new data diverges from training data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also mentioned: AI can lack the explainability necessary to diagnose errors, there are difficulties meeting compliance requirements as AI rapidly evolves, and there’s a human de-skilling effect caused by a creeping over-dependence on AI. Likewise, AI alerts might lead to distraction and cognitive overload among employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the tendency of AI technologies such as chatbots and LLMs to hallucinate raises doubts about whether the technology is robust enough to be used in environments where safety is a priority. “AI may not be reliable enough to independently make critical decisions in industrial environments. As such, AI such as LLMs almost certainly should not be used to make safety decisions for OT environments,” said the authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This underlines an important difference between using AI in an OT setting and an IT one – OT networks are by nature safety-critical. Although many of the issues are the same, the margin for error is much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="struggling-to-unwind"&gt;Struggling to unwind&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The guidance raises the right questions: what risks are we introducing, what value does AI truly bring, who is accountable for oversight, and how do we respond when the technology misbehaves?” commented &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sammaesschalck/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam Maesschalck&lt;/a&gt;, an OT engineer with cyber security training platform Immersive Labs. “We’ve already seen what happens when operational demands outpace secure design. IT/OT convergence brought efficiency, but it also exposed OT networks in ways the industry is still struggling to unwind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Maesschalck, grafting AI systems onto OT infrastructure would fail if pre-existing issues aren’t addressed first. These include the inability of some OT devices to feed the required volumes of data to AI platforms, and a lack of asset inventories that make problem interactions more difficult to predict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the guidelines’ recommendations are for organizations to adopt CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3803081/cisa-unveils-secure-by-demand-guidelines-to-bolster-ot-security.html" target="_blank"&gt;secure design principles&lt;/a&gt;, and to assess whether developing an AI-OT project inhouse would give organizations more control over AI design and implementation in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This kind of guidance is influential because operators are looking for clarity. Having government-backed principles to reference gives owners and engineers something concrete to point to when they push back on unsafe or rushed adoption. It also reinforces how essential education is,” said Maesschalck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidelines arrive on the heels of last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3545051/make-ot-networks-a-priority-say-nine-national-security-agencies.html" target="_blank"&gt;NSA and ACSC report&lt;/a&gt; listing the steps organizations should take to secure OT in critical infrastructure. But neither document addresses &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3951163/too-little-budget-for-ot-security.html" target="_blank"&gt;continuing concerns that OT security still doesn’t get the budget it warrants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Suspicious traffic could be testing CDN evasion, says expert</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101395/suspicious-traffic-could-be-testing-cdn-evasion-says-expert.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An individual or group is doing new probing of content delivery networks (CDNs), an effort that CSOs, CIOs and network administrators should worry about if they use CDNs instead of web application firewalls to protect websites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the conclusion of &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/dr-johannes-ullrich" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Johannes Ullrich&lt;/a&gt;, dean of research at the SANS Institute, &lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/32532" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;who this week said&lt;/a&gt;  his organization’s honeypots last month detected a curious amount of traffic with server requests that include CDN-related headers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, he said, someone is testing a tactic to evade CDN defences for launching either a targeted attack or a widespread distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on a site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the honeypots have seen headers on traffic that include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Cf-Warp-Tag-Id,” which is associated with Cloudflare’s Warp VPN service;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“X-Fastly-Request-Id,”, which is associated with the Fastly CDN;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“X-Akamai-Transformed,” a header added by Akamai;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;and a puzzler: “X-T0Ken-Inf0.” Ullrich thinks it might contain a form of authentication token, but isn’t sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an interview, he said one explanation is that a threat actor is trying to get around a CDN’s filters by creating page requests that include a CDN-related header.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that these requests are merely going through a CDN, but, Ullrich said, “the requests we’re seeing don’t quite look like that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internet requests are messages sent from a client such as a web browser to a web server, requesting a web page. A wave of requests can be a DDoS attack, or mask a different kind of attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These days, many organizations use CDNs or cloud providers for basic DDoS protection and bot filtering in addition to load balancing. In a typical setup, Ullrich said, DNS is used to point clients to the CDN, which then forwards the request to a customer’s web server.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a problem: If an attacker can identify the IP address of the actual web server, they are often able to bypass the CDN and reach the web server directly. There are a few ways for users to prevent this. For example, depending on the CDN selected, it may be possible to allow access only from the CDN’s IP address space. However, for some of the larger providers, this list of addresses may be large and very dynamic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another option is to add custom headers. Some CDNs offer special custom headers with randomized values to identify requests that have passed through the CDN. And a less secure option is to look for any header that identifies the CDN. However, Ullrich noted, merely looking for a header should be avoided, as attackers can easily include this header in their traffic. This appears to be the activity the SANS honeypot has been seeing since November.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for CDN Cloudflare’s PR agency said a comment couldn’t be arranged by deadline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related content:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/4092917/how-a-bot-management-file-push-crippled-cloudflares-global-network.html" target="_blank"&gt;How a bot management file push crippled Cloudflare’s global network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellman/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kellman Meghu&lt;/a&gt;, chief security architect at DeepCove Security, says the activity seen by the SANS Institute’s honeypots isn’t new. But, he added, it only becomes an issue when there is improper access control, or the controls fail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Origin web servers should be deployed with access controls, be it security groups or firewall rules, to only ever allow communication with the CDN service,” he said in an email. “Just deploying your web application as accessible to the world, and then overlaying a CDN to act as the front end seems like a terrible waste of money and effort. In today’s world of infrastructure-as-code, this can and should be easy to manage and mitigate as far as risk goes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aryaka.com/author/adityaksood/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aditya Sood&lt;/a&gt;, VP of security engineering and AI strategy at Aryaka, said in an email that a surge in requests that include CDN-related headers “is clear experimentation from threat actors, and the impersonation isn’t just random noise, its reconnaissance. Attacks are probing to uncover the weak origin validation in organizations who are trusting the mere presence of a CDN-specific header instead of enforcing proper controls like IP allowlists, private network peering, or cryptographically validated tokens. When you see multiple CDN fingerprints being spoofed at roughly the same time, it usually means new tooling or automated scanners are being deployed in the wild.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proper origin hardening that includes strict IP allowlists, validated tokens, or private connectivity is essential to protect websites, he said. “Relying only on the presence of CDN-specific headers is no longer viable, and organizations that have not fully locked down their backend infrastructure may already be exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ullrich added that CDNs and other traffic filtering services will issue a unique value to each customer as proof that traffic has gone through its service, so web administrators should configure their web servers or next generation firewalls to only accept requests with that unique value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The activity SANS has seen is “definitely something that should be seen as a warning that something that could become more than it is now,” he said. “Now it’s only a curiosity, but it could easily become more. You [admins] need to follow your content delivery network’s guidance to protect your web server from attacks like this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Das CISO-Paradoxon: Innovation ermöglichen und Risiken managen</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099334/das-ciso-paradoxon-innovation-ermoglichen-und-risiken-managen.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Zusammenarbeit" class="wp-image-4099374" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2196524059.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;CISOs sollten eng mit anderen Teams zusammenarbeiten.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;eamesBot – shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eine der Hauptaufgaben von &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4072083/vom-ciso-zum-chief-risk-architect.html" target="_blank"&gt;CISOs&lt;/a&gt; besteht darin, nicht mehr die „Abteilung des Neins“ zu sein. Sie müssen Wege finden, die schnelle Bereitstellung von Produkten und Dienstleistungen für das Unternehmen zu ermöglichen, ohne gleichzeitig neue Risiken einzuführen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das ist, kurz gesagt, das Paradoxon. In einem Umfeld, in dem Produktteams ständig neue Technologien testen und Updates in Rekordgeschwindigkeit bereitstellen müssen, können traditionelle Audits am Ende des Entwicklungszyklus nicht mithalten. Sicherheit muss vorgelagert werden. Sie muss in den täglichen Betrieb integriert werden, mit proaktiven, umsetzbaren Maßnahmen, die Innovationen fördern, anstatt sie zu bremsen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs müssen daher von Anfang an enger mit den Teams zusammenarbeiten, um klare und praktische Risikotoleranzen festzulegen und Sicherheit in die Entwicklungsabläufe zu integrieren.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fruhzeitig-partnerschaften-eingehen-um-ergebnisse-zu-gestalten"&gt;Frühzeitig Partnerschaften eingehen, um Ergebnisse zu gestalten&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs gewinnen nicht an Einfluss, wenn sie erst am Ende auftauchen. Sie müssen ihre Gatekeeper-Mentalität ablegen und vom ersten Tag an echte Partner sein. In der Vergangenheit, als Sicherheitsmaßnahmen erst in der Endphase eingeführt wurden, standen Entscheidungsträger vor einer schwierigen Wahl: Projektverzögerungen akzeptieren oder unverminderte Risiken in Kauf nehmen. Als Produktzyklen noch quartalsweise waren und Geschwindigkeit nicht über die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit entschied, war dieser Ansatz sinnvoll. In der heutigen Realität mit KI-gesteuerter Produktentwicklung funktioniert ein solcher Prozess in einem Umfeld, das aus Wochensprints, kontinuierlicher Bereitstellung und Abhängigkeiten von Herstellern besteht, nicht mehr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn die Sicherheitsabteilung die Umsatzziele, Kundenversprechen und regulatorischen Risiken versteht, werden die Leitlinien konkret und hilfreich. Unternehmen sollten daher jedem Produktteam einen Sicherheitsbeauftragten zur Seite stellen. Dadurch gibt es immer eine vertraute Person, die sich mit Entscheidungen zu Identität, Datenflüssen, Protokollierung und Verschlüsselung befasst, sobald diese anstehen. Wir sollten nicht wollen, dass Entwickler für eine einfache Frage zweiwöchige Tickets eröffnen müssen. Es sollte offene „Sprechstunden”, Chat-Kanäle und kurze Telefonate geben, damit sie sofortiges Feedback zu Entscheidungen wie API-Design, Verschlüsselungsanforderungen und regionalen Datenbewegungen erhalten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bürokratie muss im Sicherheitsumfeld abgeschafft werden. Sicherheitsmanager sollten an Sprint-Planungen und frühen Design-Reviews teilnehmen, um wichtige Fragen zu klären – beispielsweise Authentifizierungspfade, Least-Privilege-Zugriffe, Logging-Abdeckungoder wie Änderungen in der Produktion durch SIEM und EDR überwacht werden. Wenn CISOs mit am Tisch sitzen, ändert sich die Frage von „Können wir das machen?“ zu „Wie machen wir das sicher?“ und schon vom ersten Tag an werden bessere Ergebnisse erzielt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="risikotoleranzen-und-leitplanken-festlegen"&gt;Risikotoleranzen und Leitplanken festlegen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Teams werden langsamer, wenn sie sich nicht sicher sind, wie sie vorgehen sollen. Deshalb sollten ihnen ein Teil der Entscheidungsfindung abgenommen und die Integration von Authentifizierung, Autorisierung und Abrechnung in den Entwicklungsprozess übernommen werden. Für die Authentifizierung sollten Sie Lösungen für das Identitätsmanagement im Unternehmen einrichten und nutzen, anstatt Accounts zu entwickeln, die fest in Datenbanken geschrieben werden und die leicht kompromittierbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sicherheitschefs müssen außerdem standardisierte rollenbasierte Zugriffskontrollstufen definieren, die eine klare Aufgabentrennung im Lösungsdesign gewährleisten. Dazu sollte die Abrechnung nicht nur aus Protokollen bestehen, sondern Daten mit hoher Kardinalität zur Erkennung von Anomalien erfassen. Anschließen müssen diese in ein zentrales &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4043049/warum-das-soc-in-der-krise-steckt-und-wie-sie-das-andern.html" target="_blank"&gt;SOC&lt;/a&gt; (Security Operations Center) zur Erkennung und Reaktion auf Bedrohungen integriert werden. Produktentwicklungsteams sollten nicht mit Sicherheitsaufgaben betraut werden; stattdessen sollten andere Teams die Sichtbarkeit der Bedrohungen für die Lösungen in der Produktion im Auge behalten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495028/chief-information-security-officer-ein-neues-berufsbild-fur-cisos.html" target="_blank"&gt;CISOs&lt;/a&gt; müssen die Risikobereitschaft des Unternehmens in einer Geschäftssprache definieren, die keine Interpretationsspielräume zulässt. Sie sollten festlegen, welche Profile von Drittanbietern einer eingehenden Bewertung bedürfen und welche als begrenzte Pilotprojekte mit kompensierenden Kontrollen durchgeführt werden können. Entscheiden Sie, welche Schwachstellen einen Merge blockieren müssen und welche mit einem zeitlich begrenzten Behebungsplan fortgesetzt werden können. Klären Sie, welche Datenklassifizierungen regionenübergreifend sein dürfen und welche Schutzmaßnahmen dafür erforderlich sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anschließend müssen diese Entscheidungen in Automatisierung umgesetzt werden. Integrieren Sie Schutzmaßnahmen in CI/CD und Infrastructure-as-Code, damit die Durchsetzung konsistent und sichtbar ist. Scannen Sie jeden Code-Commit auf Schwachstellen, und wenn eine Änderung gegen eine kritische Richtlinie verstößt, schlägt der Build fehl – mit einer klaren Begründung und einem Lösungsweg. Liegt die Änderung innerhalb der Toleranzen, wird er ohne manuelles Eingreifen fortgesetzt. Das Ergebnis ist Governance als Beschleuniger: vorhersehbar, transparent und abgestimmt auf die Arbeitsweise der Entwicklungsteams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-by-design-in-schnelle-entwicklerzyklen-integrieren"&gt;Security-by-Design in schnelle Entwicklerzyklen integrieren&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn Entwickler mehrmals täglich Code bereitstellen, funktioniert eine „abschließende Sicherheitsüberprüfung” vor der Veröffentlichung einfach nicht. Dieses traditionelle Gatekeeping-Modell am Ende des Prozesses blockiert nicht nur Innovationen, sondern versäumt es auch, reale Risiken zu erkennen. Um effektiv zu sein, muss &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3491579/secdevops-sicherheit-im-devops-prozess.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sicherheit während der Entwicklung&lt;/a&gt; eingebettet werden und nicht erst nachträglich überprüft werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn der sichere Weg schwieriger ist als der unsichere Weg, werden Entwickler jedes Mal den einfachen Weg wählen. Die Aufgabe des CISO besteht nicht darin, ein 50-seitiges PDF zu verteilen, sondern Sicherheit direkt in die Entwicklerumgebung zu integrieren und ihnen vorab geprüfte, gehärtete Templates mit bereits integrierter Authentifizierung und Autorisierung zur Verfügung zu stellen, die standardmäßig sicher sind. Wenn die sichere Komponente einfacher zu verwenden ist als die unsichere Alternative, können Entwickler sie problemlos und jederzeit einsetzen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Automatisierung ist die Durchsetzungsebene für diese Strategie. Wenn Sicherheitstools direkt in die CI/CD-Pipeline integriert sind, ist Feedback fast in Echtzeit verfügbar. So kann das Team bei kritischen Risiken „schnell scheitern“ und gleichzeitig umsetzbare Korrekturen vornehmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diese Disziplin muss sich bis in die Produktion hineinziehen. Selbst mit erstklassigen DevSecOps wissen wir, dass Zero-Day-Angriffe oder Konfigurationsabweichungen auftreten können. Deshalb sollten wir uns auf übergreifende Lösungen zum Schutz von Webanwendungen verlassen, die eine robuste Web-Application-Firewall mit Laufzeit-Angriffsabwehr und Selbstschutz integrieren. Diese Lösungen mindern Schwachstellen und Risiken in Echtzeit, während die Anwendung in der Produktion läuft. Sie verschaffen den Entwicklungsteams die entscheidende Zeit, die sie benötigen, um das zugrunde liegende Problem ohne Dienstunterbrechung oder Sicherheitsverletzung zu beheben. Zudem wird so sichergestellt, dass wir selbst dann eingreifen können, wenn alle anderen Kontrollen versagen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laufzeit-Telemetrie und risikobasierte Warnmeldungen sind die letzte Schutzschicht in diesem Konzept. Dies fördert einen kulturellen Wandel, der es Entwicklern ermöglicht, die volle Verantwortung für ihre Anwendungen zu übernehmen, von der ersten Codezeile bis hin zur Produktion. Die Sicherheit wiederum erreicht so eine umfassende und dauerhafte Abdeckung, ohne zum Engpass zu werden. (jm)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SpyCloud Data Shows Corporate Users 3x More Likely to Be Targeted by Phishing Than by Malware</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101513/spycloud-data-shows-corporate-users-3x-more-likely-to-be-targeted-by-phishing-than-by-malware.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing has surged 400% year-over-year, highlighting need for real-time visibility into identity exposures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SpyCloud&lt;/a&gt;, the leader in identity threat protection, today released new data showing a sharp rise in phishing attacks that disproportionately target corporate users. The company tracked a 400% year-over-year increase in successfully phished identities, with nearly 40% of the 28+ million recaptured phished records containing a business email address – compared to just 11.5% in recaptured malware data. The result is a warning to enterprises that their workforce is three times more likely to be targeted with phishing attacks than infostealer malware. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings reinforce a growing shift in cybercriminals’ strategy: phishing is now the preferred gateway into enterprise environments, and &lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/resource/report/2025-lessons-2026-predictions/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SpyCloud sees this trend continuing in 2026&lt;/a&gt;. Threat actors are using this access as a launchpad for follow-on attacks, with SpyCloud reporting in its &lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/resource/report/identity-threat-report-2025" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2025 Identity Threat Report&lt;/a&gt; that phishing is now the leading entry point for ransomware, accounting for 35% of all ransomware infections. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Phishing is now one of the most scalable tools cybercriminals use to breach enterprise environments,” said Trevor Hilligoss, SpyCloud’s Head of Security Research. “Cybercrime enablement services, like phishing-as-a-service kits that automate convincing lures and adversary-in-the-middle tactics that capture MFA tokens and session cookies, put advanced tactics into the hands of low-skilled actors, making it easier than ever to compromise users at scale. SpyCloud’s visibility into these campaigns gives organizations a critical edge, helping them detect who’s been targeted and what data has been exposed, and remediate those credentials before they can be weaponized.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SpyCloud is the only provider recapturing and automatically remediating successfully phished identity data and targeting lists at scale before follow-on attacks like ransomware, fraud, and account takeover can occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations rely on traditional defenses like email filtering, endpoint protection, and employee education to stop phishing and malware attempts, but those tools only go so far,” said Damon Fleury, SpyCloud’s Chief Product Officer. “Attackers are still getting through – and when they do, it’s the exposed identity data that enables further harm. Security teams need to be vigilant about what’s already been compromised and circulating in the criminal underground. Prevention is important, but without real-time visibility and post-compromise remediation, it’s not enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While phishing has become a dominant entry point, malware remains a critical threat vector. In the age of remote work and bring-your-own-device policies, personal exposures are increasingly used to compromise enterprise environments. A recent example is the &lt;a href="https://www.nikkei.co.jp/nikkeiinfo/en/news/announcements/1394.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2025 Nikkei breach&lt;/a&gt;, where malware on a personal device led to the compromise of sensitive corporate data. Despite only 11.5% of recaptured malware infections exfiltrating business email addresses directly, SpyCloud data shows that &lt;a href="https://spycloud.com/newsroom/annual-identity-exposure-report-2025/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1 in 2 corporate users&lt;/a&gt; have been the victim of an infostealer malware infection in their digital history, whether that be on a managed or unmanaged device – a strong indicator that threat actors are moving laterally from personal to corporate accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Protecting the enterprise means looking beyond corporate accounts,” Fleury added. “Due to the continuous reuse of passwords and shared identity data across work and personal accounts like mobile numbers, the line between a user’s personal digital history and their professional access effectively no longer exists. That’s why it’s essential to monitor and remediate exposures across the full spectrum of an individual’s digital identity – personal and professional.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SpyCloud is the leader in holistic identity protection, detecting and protecting organizations from the phishing, malware, and breach exposures of employees, contractors, and vendors across personal and professional identities.

      <title>15 years in, zero trust remains elusive — with AI rising to complicate the challenge</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101457/15-years-in-zero-trust-remains-elusive-with-ai-rising-to-complicate-the-challenge.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/564201/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html"&gt;zero trust&lt;/a&gt; approach cybersecurity access control is more than 15 years old but organizations continue to struggle with its implementation due in large part to fragmented tooling and legacy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4048002/88-of-cisos-struggle-to-implement-zero-trust.html"&gt;recent report from Accenture&lt;/a&gt; paints a picture of widespread industry struggles in rolling out zero trust technologies, a perspective in line with the experiences of experts and security practitioners quizzed on the topic by CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/zero-trust/"&gt;Zero trust networking&lt;/a&gt; involves applying a security framework where no user or device is trusted by default. Under zero trust, every access attempt is accompanied by authenticating identity and device compliance regardless of whether or not it originates within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach contrasts with traditional “castle and moat” models where devices within an enterprise network were trusted by default.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many enterprises have progressed slowly on their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3965399/security-leaders-shed-light-on-their-zero-trust-journeys.html"&gt;zero trust journeys&lt;/a&gt; largely because implementation requires a fundamental shift in both mindset and infrastructure. Key roadblocks include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy systems that weren’t designed for zero trust principles,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fragmented identity and access tools that make unified enforcement difficult, and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cultural and organizational resistance to changing long-standing trust models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylewickert/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Kyle Wickert&lt;/a&gt;, field CTO at AlgoSec, says zero trust remains one of the most misunderstood transformations in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Many organizations still hesitate to pursue it because they associate zero trust with rigid architectures, operational complexity, and high implementation costs,” Wickert says. “That perception is rooted in the legacy days of reassigning IPs, redesigning routing, re-plumbing VLANs, or physically rewiring environments just to enforce segmentation policies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry-wide shift to software-defined and cloud-driven data centers has lifted legacy challenges while creating new issues in the shape of growing policy and application complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest obstacles to zero trust at scale is no longer the infrastructure — it’s the challenge of defining, governing, and maintaining policies that adapt across hybrid networks, spanning on-prem firewalls, cloud-native controls, SDN, SD-WAN, and SASE technologies,” Wickert says. “The most effective way to overcome these challenges is to shift the focus of segmentation from ‘devices and subnets’ to applications and their connectivity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickhholland/"&gt;Richard Holland&lt;/a&gt;, field CISO at threat-led cybersecurity firm Quorum Cyber, argues that zero trust represents a method to mature an organization’s security health rather than a set of products and services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that the technology to achieve zero trust has been in existence for some time and CISOs and CIOs may have already found themselves on a roadmap without realizing it is zero trust,” Holland says. “By treating zero trust as a journey to improve cybersecurity health, and by taking small bite-size chunks, you can iterate through a series of improvements in relatively quick succession.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other cybersecurity experts contend that zero trust migrations offer an opportunity to support more ambitious IT transformation projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-fridakis-96184b/"&gt;Stephen Fridakis&lt;/a&gt;, CISO in residence at Cyderes, says the shift from network-based rules to identity-based rules inherent in zero trust implementations offers a roadmap to “safer, simpler, and more durable” enterprise architectures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“IP ranges, VLANs, and physical locations are brittle and age badly, especially with M&amp;amp;A churn and cloud adoption,” Fridakis explains. “Identity-based access follows the user and device, not the network.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He adds: “It eliminates firewall sprawl, reduces engineering overhead, and enforces intent instead of infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="wise-up"&gt;Wise up&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;University of Texas CISO &lt;a href="https://www.utsystem.edu/offices/information-security/chief-information-security-officer"&gt;George Finney&lt;/a&gt; has discussed zero trust with hundreds of security leaders. Those conversations have uncovered several common denominators on why zero trust projects fail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Firstly, internal politics has the potential to derail zero trust implementations. “Technology in a company is generally operated and supported in silos,” Finney says. “These different areas may not understand the big picture of how much risk a cybersecurity breach could represent and resist change.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, in organizations that have successfully shifted to zero trust, “leadership in every area agree that security is a core part of the success of the organization as a whole,” Finney says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insufficient education can also act as a barrier preventing the successful rollout of zero trust technologies, according to Finney.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Starting a zero trust project requires more than just changing the design of a network or modifying some settings in an application,” he says. “Everyone on the team needs to understand what zero trust is, why the organization is doing it, and what role they’ll play in supporting it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This means that every zero trust project needs to begin with education to help change not just the technology, but the culture of the organization as well,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garybrickhouse/"&gt;Gary Brickhouse&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at GuidePoint Security, notes that an “overly-complex approach” to zero trust has driven up costs and timelines as organizations pursue overly strict alignment with zero trust principles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most organizations would benefit from a simplified risk-based approach, identifying critical use cases that are achievable and deliver the desired outcome of risk reduction,” Brickhouse says. “Early wins improving the security of the organization and moving the ZT [zero trust] needle forward builds confidence across the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Rob Forbes&lt;/a&gt;, CISO at Stratascale, advises security leaders to develop a strategic roadmap before embarking on any zero trust project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[CISOs should] start with a comprehensive assessment of their current security posture and assets,” Forbes counsels. “Next, develop a roadmap for zero trust implementation, prioritizing critical assets and high-risk areas.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These steps should be followed by investments in training and tools to support the transition to a zero trust model, which ought to be left open to further refinement as requirement evolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Companies should] regularly review and update their zero trust strategy to adapt to new threats and technologies,” Forbes adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-reinforces-zero-trust-paradigm"&gt;AI ‘reinforces’ zero trust paradigm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4047974/agentic-ai-a-cisos-security-nightmare-in-the-making.html"&gt;agentic AI &lt;/a&gt;becomes increasingly embedded in the business, standard zero trust principles must be extended to keep the enterprise secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2027, growth of AI agents will push 50% of CIOs to restructure and automate identity and data access and authorization management to reduce misuse and leakage as part of a zero trust architecture, according to industry analyst firm IDC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security experts call on organizations to implement a new wave of zero trust, extending beyond people and devices to include AI agents. In practice, this means enforcing strict context boundaries, trusted domain controls, and AI-specific security reviews.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kindervag-40572b1/"&gt;John Kindervag&lt;/a&gt;, chief evangelist officer at Illumio, tells CSO that “AI doesn’t change the zero trust paradigm — it reinforces it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI operates within the constraints of cybersecurity’s foundational rules, and attacks only work if there’s an open door,” Kindervag argues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bigger risk is from AI models, according to Kindervag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI models can become a liability if not governed by zero trust,” he says. “If an organization doesn’t treat its AI models as protect surfaces, they risk manipulation, poisoning, or theft.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most cases, AI supports zero trust implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Good AI highlights high-risk communication patterns, surfaces unusual behaviour, and accelerates processes like labeling and policy implementation,” Kindervag explains. “AI can help in every step of the zero trust five-step methodology, but it really helps organizations to push beyond resilience into anti-fragility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Submarine cable cybersecurity: protecting critical infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4099959/submarine-cable-cybersecurity-protecting-critical-infrastructure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 95 and 99% of the world’s data traffic travels through submarine cables. An extensive network of more than 1.3 million kilometers, which travels across the seas and oceans, from shore to shore. According to &lt;a href="https://www2.telegeography.com/transport-networks?hsCtaAttrib=180200503225" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TeleGeography&lt;/a&gt;, there are 650 of these infrastructures in operation or in the pipeline, mainly operated by private companies. Whether we can connect to the internet, back up our computer files, make a bank transaction with our cell phone or communicate with other people depends to a large extent on whether nothing happens to the submarine cables that cross the world from one coast to another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent times, numerous incidents where the breakage of a cable leaves a territory without connectivity are proof that despite their critical nature. They are not always properly protected: in the Baltic Sea alone, between 2022 and July 2025, ten cases of submarine cable breakage were &lt;a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/news/baltic-sea-undersea-cable-security/"&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt;, seven between November 2024 and January 2025. In most of these incidents, international governments interests were suspected to be behind them, with Chinese or Russian involvement. In a complicated geopolitical context, these types of events, in which there remains some doubt as to whether they are accidental or intentional, put the focus on the need to ensure protection. Both at the physical and cybersecurity levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US &lt;em&gt;think tank&lt;/em&gt; Atlantic Council &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/cyber-defense-across-the-ocean-floor-the-geopolitics-of-submarine-cable-security/"&gt;identifies&lt;/a&gt; several trends that threaten the security of submarine cables. On the one hand, linked to the geostrategic issue, the presence of authoritarian governments are reshaping the internet’s physical layout through companies that control internet infrastructure, to route data more favorably, interrupting the provision of services or taking advantage of infrastructures for espionage. In addition, network management centers have moved from locations close to cable entry points to remote ones, which adds new levels of risk. Finally, with the rise of technologies such as cloud computing, 5G or IoT, the volume of data transmitted over these cables has increased, but also their sensitivity, as more and more sectors depend on these tools for their performance. Once again, these are added factors for which cybersecurity and security policies for these critical infrastructures need to be reviewed. In fact, the European Union is taking action, with a &lt;a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-explains/subsea-cables-how-vulnerable-are-they-and-can-we-protect-them_en"&gt;Cable Security Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; published in February 2025 that alludes not only to the physical challenges, but also to the need for cyber protection. But with the vast majority of cables in the hands of private companies, the approach they take is critical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dealing-with-the-cybersecurity-of-submarine-cables"&gt;Dealing with the cybersecurity of submarine cables&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this new scenario, big technology companies are becoming major players thanks to their growing presence as a project developer: in a decade, Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have gone from having 10% of international capacity to 71%. Asked how they address issues of infrastructure protection and cybersecurity, Google says they focus on the physical aspect. “Security is a key factor in all our infrastructure investments. Routes are deliberately chosen with many factors in mind, and methods such as shielding and cable burial are used to protect submarine cables.” Google says fishing boats and ship anchors as the greatest physical risk, and notes that “the best protection against these risks and any other physical damage is to build a network infrastructure that achieves resilience, in part, through multiple diverse network routes. Our philosophy is to create sufficient concurrent network paths at metropolitan, regional and global levels, along with a scalable software control plane, to support traffic redistribution and minimize network congestion. When physical damage occurs, redundant network paths can reroute traffic to minimize service disruption for customers and users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the Spanish companies most involved in this global network is Telxius, a subsidiary of Telefónica. The company stresses that “submarine cables are more than just infrastructure; they are the backbone of the global digital ecosystem. In a hyperconnected world, submarine cables are essential and are part of a broader digital ecosystem that goes beyond the coast to key data centers,” the company says. Regarding the physical protection of this type of critical infrastructure, the company points to a significant improvement in recent times. “Physical accessibility is limited, so redundancy and resilience are still essential to guarantee continuity in the event of accidental damage caused by fishing, anchoring or natural phenomena such as earthquakes or landslides which, in the absence of redundancy, could affect service continuity”. In terms of cybersecurity, there is a twofold perspective. On the one hand, “it guarantees diversity and redundancy in all our terrestrial and submarine routes, which allows us to maintain service continuity with high availability even in the event of outages”. They exemplify this with the case of its transatlantic route, where Telxius offers what they call redundant connectivity through its two state-of-the-art submarine cables: Marea and Dunant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, from the Telefónica subsidiary they talk about protecting the infrastructure through a comprehensive security model. “In terms of cybersecurity, Telxius adopts, for its IT systems, networks and devices, a multi-layered approach and leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning for real-time threat detection.” This comprehensive model would thus combine different elements including physical measures and cybersecurity in the mooring stations, periodic audits and continuous evaluation, continuity and disaster recovery plans, periodic testing and clear protocols for crisis action, training and awareness to reduce social engineering risks and the use of AI and machine learning for proactive detection and risk mitigation. “And all this from regulatory compliance in key areas: business continuity, information security, environmental management and energy efficiency,” they summarize. A necessary framework to ensure the continuity of an infrastructure on which much of modern life depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoiding the next technical debt: Building AI governance before it breaks</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101145/avoiding-the-next-technical-debt-building-ai-governance-before-it-breaks.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI rush is repeating a familiar mistake. Early in my career, a risk executive I worked with used to say, “You didn’t invite me to drink the beer; now you want me to pay the bill?” whenever problems came up because a project moved ahead without enough oversight. If someone tried to avoid explaining the details, he’d add, “I don’t know if you’re showing me the monster’s head or just its toe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, I’ve watched new products, business services and innovations launch without enough security or risk checks. Cloud computing, big data, BYOD, APIs, IoT, social media and low-code are just a few examples. We usually innovate first and worry about governance later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI is following the same pattern. Leaders in many industries are excited about AI, just like they were with earlier technologies. But many still don’t have a clear way to track where AI is used, who owns the risks or how automated decisions could affect the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ten years of fail fast have shown us the risks: more incidents, data breaches and bigger exposure. If organizations don’t build risk and accountability into AI now, they’ll face the same problems we saw with earlier innovations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-real-risk-isnt-ai-itself-its-how-we-use-it"&gt;The real risk isn’t AI itself, it’s how we use it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with detailed frameworks like the &lt;a href="https://airisk.mit.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MIT AI Risk Repository&lt;/a&gt;, many organizations still struggle to connect AI risks to real business problems. Everyone wants new use cases, but few are tracking where risks begin — in the data, the models or the quick decisions machines make.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, AI risks aren’t just about the future — they’re already part of daily operations. These risks arise when algorithms affect business results without clear accountability, when tools collect sensitive data and when automated systems make decisions that people no longer check.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These governance gaps aren’t new. We saw the same issues with cloud, APIs, IoT and big data. The solution is also familiar: keep track, assess, control and monitor. The first step is knowing where AI is used, what data it handles and which processes it touches. With this visibility, governance becomes about managing what’s already in the business, not just fearing the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is protection. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel or develop advanced new methods. Instead, we should start with the basics: with simple governance steps and then you can evolve your journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="borrow-what-already-works"&gt;Borrow what already works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is companies don’t have to start from scratch with AI governance. Guidelines for secure and compliant technology already exist in cybersecurity, cloud and privacy programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s needed is to apply traditional controls to this new context:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classification and ownership.&lt;/strong&gt; Every model should have a clear owner, with limits on who can train, query or deploy it. Its relevance to the business should be clear by different criteria, such as regulatory, operational or revenue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baseline security and non-negotiables.&lt;/strong&gt; Access control, multifactor authentication, network segmentation and audit logging are just as important for AI environments as they are for servers or clouds.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous monitoring.&lt;/strong&gt; Model behavior should be more than just accurate — it should be observable, traceable and accountable for any changes in purpose.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party due diligence.&lt;/strong&gt; Contracts with AI providers should clearly define rights over training data, generated content and how to respond to incidents.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and validation.&lt;/strong&gt; Red-teaming, AI-specific penetration testing and scenario simulations should be regular practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These controls aren’t new, nor is the hope of avoiding another form of technical debt. Maybe this time we can apply the secure by design approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same governance principles will be tested again soon; this time by a new wave of autonomous systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-rise-of-agent-ai-and-the-accountability-vacuum"&gt;The rise of agent AI and the accountability vacuum&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new generation of agent AI systems can act on their own across different platforms, doing tasks, making purchases or retrieving data without direct human input. This move from simple chatbots to self-directed agents creates an accountability gap that most organizations aren’t ready for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without the right guardrails, an agent can access systems it shouldn’t, expose confidential data, create unreliable information, start unauthorized transactions, skip established workflows or even act against company policy or ethics. These risks are made worse by how fast and independently agent AI works, which can cause big problems before people notice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the rush to try new things, many companies launch these agents without basic access controls or oversight. The answer is to use proven controls like least privilege, segregation of duties, monitoring and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Executives should be able to answer fundamental questions, drawn from frameworks such as NIST AI RMF, about any autonomous AI operating in their environment:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What governance processes are in place (policies, roles and responsibilities, oversight)?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Which use cases and business applicability are being leveraged?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Who is accountable when it goes wrong?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Which risks does it represent? And which controls are applied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-governance-into-the-business-not-around-it"&gt;Building governance into the business, not around it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective AI governance isn’t an IT function, any more than cybersecurity is. It’s a business function with shared accountability. Forward-looking organizations are now introducing three mechanisms that embed governance into operations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI self-assessment frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; — simple checklists that help each business unit map their AI use cases, data sources and risks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage governance committees&lt;/strong&gt; — cross-functional bodies with representation from risk, compliance, cybersecurity and business leaders.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate AI use policies&lt;/strong&gt; — defining approved tools, contractual standards and minimum safeguards for both internal and external AI usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These aren’t bureaucratic layers but foundations of sustainable innovation. When the business owns the inventory, risk teams can focus on assurance rather than discovery. Modern governance should enable adoption, not inhibit or slow it down, but help scale it safely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dont-build-another-debt"&gt;Don’t build another debt&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The similarities to cloud adoption are clear. Ten years ago, not having early controls led to exposed data, unmonitored systems and expensive fixes. AI is showing the same pattern, but it’s happening faster and with bigger consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Technical debt isn’t just about code anymore. It’s also about trusting your data, holding models accountable and protecting your brand’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The organizations that succeed with AI will be the ones that see governance as part of the design process, not as something that causes delays. They’ll move forward with clear plans and measure value and risk together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’ll see that real innovation isn’t just about building smarter systems but about making them safe, accountable and trusted from the start. For technology and business leaders, this isn’t just a security imperative. It’s a strategy for sustainable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coupang breach of 33.7 million accounts allegedly involved engineer insider</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4101486/coupang-leaks-personal-information-of-33-7-million-accounts-suspected-of-poor-authentication-key-management.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A prolonged lack of management of valid authentication keys for signed access tokens issued to authenticators is believed to be the root cause of over 30 million accounts being exposed externally by ecommerce giant Coupang. Ongoing analysis suggests that these keys could have been exploited even after the responsible employee left the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 29, Coupang &lt;a href="https://news.coupang.com/archives/58849/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming the unauthorized exposure of personal information from approximately 4,500 accounts on Nov. 18. The company also noted that the breach had been reported to the National Police Agency, the Korea Internet &amp;amp; Security Agency, and the Personal Information Protection Commission. Subsequent investigations, however, revealed that the damage involved approximately 33.7 million accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaked information included names, email addresses, shipping address lists, and some order information. Coupang stated that payment information, credit card numbers, and login information were not included. It is believed that unauthorized access occurred via overseas servers starting on June 24, 2025. The company also stated that it is currently cooperating with relevant authorities to investigate the cause of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.msit.go.kr/bbs/view.do?sCode=user&amp;amp;mPid=208&amp;amp;mId=307&amp;amp;bbsSeqNo=94&amp;amp;nttSeqNo=3186554" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Ministry of Science and ICT, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, and other relevant agencies conducted&lt;/a&gt; an on-site investigation after receiving a report of a breach on Nov. 19 and a report of a personal information leak on Nov. 20. The investigation confirmed that the attacker exploited an authentication vulnerability in Coupang’s servers, bypassing the normal login process and leaking customer information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government launched a joint public-private investigation team on Nov. 30, and the Personal Information Protection Commission is investigating whether Coupang violated its personal information protection safety measures — access control, access authority management, encryption, etc. As a service with such a high user base that it’s often called the “Amazon of Korea,” Coupang issued a public security notice on Nov. 29 to prevent secondary damage. Furthermore, a three-month period, starting Nov. 30, will be dedicated to strengthening the monitoring of personal information leaks and illegal distribution online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Choi Min-hee, Chairwoman of the National Assembly Science, ICT, Broadcasting and Communications Committee, released the results of an analysis of the specific causes of the incident in a press release on Nov. 30. According to information received from Coupang, the company reportedly responded that “the token signing key validity period is often set to 5 to 10 years,” adding that “the rotation period is long and varies greatly depending on the key type.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chairman Choi’s side explained this incident using an analogy to an access control system. If the “token” required for login is a single-use access card, the “signature key” is like the authentication stamp used to issue the access card. While access is impossible without the authentication stamp, even with the access card, if the signature key is left unattended for an extended period, it can be subject to continued exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Rep. Choi Min-hee’s office, Coupang’s login system is designed to immediately discard tokens after they are created, but the signature information required for token creation was deleted or not updated when the employee in charge left the company, and was thus exploited by internal employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a press release, Chairman Choi Min-hee stated, “Coupang did not follow the most basic internal security procedure of renewing the signing key,” and “Abandoning a long-term valid authentication key was not simply a deviation by an internal employee, but the result of organizational and structural problems at Coupang that neglected the authentication system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Victims of this breach have been notified via email or text message. Related information can also be found on a separate &lt;a href="https://mc.coupang.com/ssr/desktop/faqlist" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;information page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coupang CEO Park Dae-joon &lt;a href="https://news.coupang.com/archives/58857/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issued a separate statement&lt;/a&gt; on Nov. 30, saying, “We sincerely apologize for causing great inconvenience and concern to the public,” and “Coupang will do its best to prevent further damage by closely cooperating with the joint public-private investigation team including the Ministry of Science and ICT, the Personal Information Protection Commission, the Korea Internet &amp;amp; Security Agency, and the National Police Agency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Korean President Lee Jae Myung this week referenced the data breach at Coupang in &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/south-koreas-lee-calls-tougher-penalties-after-coupang-data-breach-2025-12-02/"&gt;calling for increased penalties for corporate negligence&lt;/a&gt; in such scenarios. The breach is believed to be the worst in South Korea in over a decade. Bloomberg reports that the breach may be a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-03/coupang-breach-is-poised-to-be-a-landmark-case-for-south-korea"&gt;landmark case for South Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It could result in a record fine, &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20251204006900315"&gt;potentially up to 1.2 trillion won (US$814M)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10629826"&gt;prime suspect is a former Coupang engineer&lt;/a&gt; who had worked on authentication systems. The police are investigating whether the former employee acted alone or collaborated with others on the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
