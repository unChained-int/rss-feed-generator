      <title>How to simplify enterprise cybersecurity through effective identity management</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4104438/how-to-simplify-enterprise-cybersecurity-through-effective-identity-management.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identifying and securing ownership of assets can be a challenging task. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563753/two-factor-authentication-2fa-explained.html"&gt;multifactor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, conditional and privileged access can help organizations to batten down the hatches. But introducing AI technologies often adds a nightmare of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It [using AI technologies] has been a huge challenge for organizations because policy management, compliance management and security touch on every single application and every single system,” Naresh Persaud, US cyber digital identity and cyber AI blueprint leader for Deloitte says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deloittes-industrial-and-financial-customers-save-time-with-the-consultancys-identity-product"&gt;Deloitte’s industrial and financial customers save time with the consultancy’s identity product&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, Deloitte worked with a large industrial customer after identifying that account ownership was sometimes unclear in their existing system. When an endpoint event was identified, it was difficult to trace who owned the targeted account and whether it existed under multiple names.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With identity management systems, we can link the named user of that account and at the same time we can identify whether the account was vaulted in an identity in the privileged access management system,” Persaud explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system also identifies any other accounts associated with a user so they too can be examined for any evidence of intrusion. Persaud refers to this as the blast radius.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I compromise a privileged account, I might be able to use that account to reset the password for other accounts,” he says. “Immediately identifying the blast radius, determining an appropriate response and putting that information into the alert — that gives the analyst in the security operation center much better telemetry than they had before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The system helped connect pieces of the puzzle that might otherwise have to be done manually. The security analyst who flagged the issue would have needed to contact an identity system administrator — an inefficient process in even the most well-oiled operation. Identifying those points of contact and automating the communication process made for a much more efficient response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time is often consumed by attempting to map the data related to an incident to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework, for example. Industry analysis suggests this can take up to 30 minutes. “With AI enablement an analyst can drastically reduce this time up to 70-80%,” Persaud says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Persaud claims that the Deloitte solution was able to simplify the documentation. It created a dashboard that identified related accounts that were not vaulted and allowed for closer review of privileged accounts. Unvaulted accounts could be vaulted in short order and any vulnerabilities in privileged accounts could be pinpointed and addressed. This provided a higher level of precision to the way the customer does security now compared to before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deloitte also worked with a financial services client that had a similar visibility issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is challenging for a lot of organizations to get a complete picture of what their assets are and what controls apply to those assets,” Persaud says. He explains that Deloitte’s identity solution assisted the customer in connecting users with the assets they utilized. As they discovered these assets, they were able to fine-tune the security controls that were applied to each in a more refined fashion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If the system is going to [process] financial data and other private information, we need to put the right controls in place on the identity side,” he says. “We’ve been able to bring those two pieces together by correlating discovery of assets with discovery of identity and lining that up with controls from the IT asset management system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the users were able to more quickly integrate applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-apexanalytix-uses-microsoft-azure-to-manage-identity-security"&gt;How apexanalytix uses Microsoft Azure to manage identity security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Identity protection is one of the critical controls for any organization in terms of protecting digital assets,” Vishal Grover, CIO of supply chain management platform provider apexanalytix says. “But it is important to maintain the balance between restriction and business requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apexanalytics has used Microsoft products, such as Defender, for more than a decade. “Initially, we were primarily using it for antivirus. Then advanced threat protection came into the picture. Then identity protection. We kept adding more controls and more validations to strengthen the entire security posture,” he tells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company has been particularly concerned about the increased &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/518296/what-is-iam-identity-and-access-management-explained.html"&gt;identity risk&lt;/a&gt; as it expands its international footprint — notably opening offices in Hong Kong in 2016 and Saudi Arabia in 2024. As the offices interact and employees travel to other locations, it is crucial that any access to its systems is verified as legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their security team has deployed Azure Active Directory (AAD) to verify geographical boundaries — the locations from which employees might reasonably be expected to access their systems from. For example, if an employee based in the US who rarely travels attempts to log in from a remote location where they are unlikely to be, a red flag is immediately raised. Unless the user’s physical presence in that location can be verified, their credentials have likely been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From a user perspective, anytime someone is traveling outside of their base location, they need to reach out to the IT and security teams to list their specific location,” Grover notes. The adoption of these policies requires reasonable adjustments to user behavior and company policy. But the rewards are substantial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you think from a broader risk management perspective, this has been fundamental to our security model,” he says. The ability to simply track the locations of employees and assign risk accordingly is a significant advancement in risk monitoring for a company growing its international presence. The company looks out for instances of impossible travel, such as if an employee has entered the system in one location and then in another at a distant location that they could not have possibly reached during a specified period, an alert is raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security analysts also use the software to scan for risky sign-ins. If a user logs in from an IP that has been blacklisted, an alert is raised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They have increasingly relied on conditional access policies that rely on monitoring user behavior. If a user typically spends an average amount of time on certain applications and then radically changes their behavior the activity is flagged and investigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company continues to evaluate its policies at least quarterly in order to ensure that they accord with its evolving business strategies. Grover feels confident that Azure’s capabilities are up to the task but remains vigilant to new potential vulnerabilities that will need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>Launched in April 2025, the taskforce has been focused on combating the emerging trend of VaaS, where criminals outsource violent acts, often relying on young, inexperienced perpetrators. These individuals are groomed or coerced into committing a range of violent crimes, from acts of intimidation and torture to murder.What began as a growing issue in Sweden has now spread across Europe,...</description>

      <title>Coordinated strike hits violent criminal network behind large-scale illegal gambling and money laundering in Sweden</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/coordinated-strike-hits-violent-criminal-network-behind-large-scale-illegal-gambling-and-money-laundering-in-sweden</link>
      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <title>Microsoft flips security script: ‘In scope by default’ makes all vulnerabilities fair game for bug bounties</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4105950/microsoft-flips-security-script-in-scope-by-default-makes-all-vulnerabilities-fair-game-for-bug-bounties.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s AI-enabled attackers are agnostic: They’re not limiting themselves to specific companies, products, or services — they’re going where the vulnerabilities are. To meet them on this ground, Microsoft is pivoting its cybersecurity strategy to what it calls ‘In Scope by Default.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, any “critical vulnerability” with a “demonstrable impact” on Microsoft’s online services is eligible for a bounty award. This applies to code owned and managed by Microsoft, as well as to anything delivered by a third party or via open-source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors “don’t care who owns the code they try to exploit,” Tom Gallagher, VP of engineering at the Microsoft Security Response Center, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/blog/2025/12/in-scope-by-default" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the new security policy. “The same approach should apply to the security community who continue to partner with us to provide critical insights that help protect our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="goal-to-incentivize-research"&gt;Goal to ‘incentivize research’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;‘In Scope by Default’ was announced at Black Hat Europe on Friday, with Gallagher saying that Microsoft “will do whatever it takes” to remediate surfaced issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This strategic shift comes as attackers continuously up their game, aided by AI tools. Microsoft was recently impacted by a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4025691/microsoft-sharepoint-zero-day-breach-hits-on-prem-servers.html" target="_blank"&gt;zero-day vulnerability in SharePoint&lt;/a&gt; that trickled down to businesses and government agencies alike, and in October, the company’s own security update triggered &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4076016/security-patch-or-self-inflicted-ddos-microsoft-update-knocks-out-key-enterprise-functions-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;a range of failures&lt;/a&gt;. And just today, to plug the gap until Microsoft can develop its own fix, &lt;a href="https://blog.0patch.com/2025/12/free-micropatches-for-windows-remote.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free unofficial patches&lt;/a&gt; were made available by a third party for a newly-discovered Windows zero-day vulnerability that gives attackers the ability to crash the Remote Access Connection Manager (RasMan) service.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has employed a range of tactics to combat these threats. Gallagher pointed out that, in 2024, the company awarded more than $17 million through its bug bounty program and live hacking events, and its strategy pivot will expand award eligibility. Rather than only being offered for bugs in defined scopes, issues with all online services will be included by default, and as soon as the services are released.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to incentivize research on the highest risk areas, especially the areas that threat actors are most likely to exploit,” said Gallagher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eligibility will now include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft-owned domains and cloud services. Security researchers without Microsoft insider perspective will be encouraged to target its infrastructures via agreed upon rules of engagement.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Third-party code, including open source. In cases where no bug bounty exists in this area, Microsoft will now offer one. Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party code can help raise the bar for “everyone who relies on this code,” Gallagher noted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift is “quite significant,” particularly for a company of Microsoft’s size, noted &lt;a href="https://www.infotech.com/profiles/erik-avakian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Avakian&lt;/a&gt;, technical counselor at Info-Tech Research Group. The new default inclusion policy is backed by process and governance, and is being applied across the tech giant’s “massive, heterogeneous ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft is explicitly pulling third-party and open-source dependencies into scope when they impact Microsoft services, which reflects how real attacks actually traverse shared infrastructure rather than clean product boundaries,” said Avakian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are welcome to &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/vulnerability" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;submit their findings&lt;/a&gt; for assessment and for coordinated disclosure, the practice of privately reporting vulnerabilities to vendors so that they can diagnose and fix issues before they are announced publicly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and its partners follow the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pentest-rules-of-engagement" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rules of Engagement for Responsible Security Research&lt;/a&gt;, Gallagher noted, which encourages a variety of red teaming activities, such as performing vulnerability assessments on Azure virtual machines (VMs), testing surge capacity, attempting to break out of system boundaries and shared service containers, testing security monitoring and detection systems, and evaluating conditional access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these rules of engagement prohibit red teamers from using or accessing credentials that aren’t their own, launching phishing attacks against Microsoft employees, performing denial-of-service testing or other testing that generates excessive traffic, or interacting with storage accounts not included in a user’s own subscription.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="pros-and-cons-to-the-approach"&gt;Pros and cons to the approach&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This widening of scope isn’t necessarily new, noted Info-Tech’s Avakian, though cloud service providers (CSPs), financial institutions, and SaaS companies publish narrower scope language and handle many cases through back-channel negotiation. But much of this still relies heavily on researcher goodwill and internal judgment calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s wider scope is a bit different, and could result in fewer gray-area arguments and the “is this in scope?” back-and-forth questioning that can expend time and create friction with researchers, said Avakian. It also provides better signaling: If people don’t fear disqualification, they’re more likely to submit early-stage findings. This is great for defenders and can foster stronger trust in the research community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It helps send a clear message: ‘We want to hear about problems,’ and internally, it forces ownership,” said Avakian. “Once something’s in scope by default, it helps to force maturity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this could get difficult when it comes to volume, potentially leading to more low-quality reports and speculative or “nebulous” findings, he said. Engineering teams can burn out quickly if everything is treated as urgent, or if severity isn’t well-communicated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But this model can work if severity discipline is rock solid,” said Avakian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, attackers could benefit indirectly if defender teams become overloaded, where potential noise could drown out real signals, and fix velocity could slow due to triage backlogs. “In other words, operational drag could very well become the attacker’s friend,” said Avakian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers, for their part, might go down unconventional attack path rabbit holes, and less ethical hackers may spray “low-effort findings” at scale and use ambiguity to pressure for bounty money or even publicly frame rejections as Microsoft ignoring security, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, “scope is really a governance decision,” said Avakian, pointing out that enterprises fall behind when vulnerability programs are still written primarily to reduce payouts, minimize exposure, and protect brand optics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Microsoft is signaling that operational clarity beats defensive ambiguity,” said Avakian. However, “in scope by default” only works with maturity behind it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t already have strong governance, triage processes, consistent severity models, and engineering accountability, it becomes problematic,” he said. “Automation, enrichment, and experienced human judgment matter more than ever here, and Microsoft appears to be clearly investing in that long game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>
