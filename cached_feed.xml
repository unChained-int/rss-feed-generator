      <title>Cisco confirms zero-day exploitation of Secure Email products</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4108496/cisco-confirms-zero-day-exploitation-of-secure-email-products.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco has warned that a China-linked hacking group is actively exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in its Secure Email appliances to gain persistent access, forcing affected organizations to consider disruptive rebuilds of critical security infrastructure while patches remain unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco Talos said the campaign has been active since &lt;a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/uat-9686/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at least late November&lt;/a&gt;, raising concerns for security leaders about unseen compromise and how far incident response efforts may need to extend beyond the affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[ Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3523958/cisco-latest-news-and-insights.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Cisco news and insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vulnerability affects Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager appliances running AsyncOS, but only in configurations where the Spam Quarantine feature is enabled and exposed to the internet, according to Cisco.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company said there is currently no patch available, and that rebuilding affected appliances is the only way to fully remove the attackers’ persistence mechanisms in confirmed compromise cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-exposure-and-risk-scope"&gt;Enterprise exposure and risk scope&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cisco said that systems where the Spam Quarantine feature is not enabled are not affected, but analysts said this does not necessarily &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4073996/the-expanding-ciso-role-from-security-operator-to-enterprise-risk-strategist.html"&gt;reduce enterprise risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This vulnerability may remain a high-risk issue because affected appliances typically sit in privileged network positions, even though the feature is not enabled by default,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilvarkey1/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sunil Varkey&lt;/a&gt;, a cybersecurity analyst.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is also not clear how many enterprises may have enabled the feature in production environments, said &lt;a href="https://confidis.co/about/our-leadership-team/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Keith Prabhu&lt;/a&gt;, founder and CEO of Confidis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Spam Quarantine provides a way for administrators to review and release ‘false positives,’ i.e., legitimate email messages that the appliance has deemed to be spam,” Prabhu said. “In today’s remote support and 24×7 operations, it is entirely possible that this feature has been enabled by many enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hfsresearch.com/team/akshat-tyagi/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Akshat Tyagi&lt;/a&gt;, associate practice leader at HFS Research, said the bigger concern is the nature of the target. Unlike a user laptop or a standalone server, email security systems sit at the center of how organizations filter and trust email traffic, meaning attackers would be operating inside infrastructure designed to stop threats rather than receive them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fact that there’s no patch yet elevates the risk further,” Tyagi said. “When the vendor’s guidance is to rebuild appliances rather than clean them in place, it tells you this is about persistence and control, not just a one-off exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Varkey added that exploitation may not require direct internet exposure and could also occur from internal or VPN-reachable networks, advising organizations to close or restrict access to affected management ports temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rebuild-guidance-and-operational-tradeoffs"&gt;Rebuild guidance and operational tradeoffs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cisco has said that wiping and rebuilding appliances is currently required in cases where compromise has been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“From a security standpoint, it is indeed the right call,” Tyagi said. “When there’s a risk that attackers have embedded themselves deep in a system, patching alone won’t solve the issue. Rebuilding is the only way to be confident the threat is fully removed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Varkey said that this may not be a viable option for many organizations, as it introduces business risks, including downtime, misconfiguration, and the potential reintroduction of persistence through contaminated backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enterprises will need to balance remediation speed with business continuity while relying on compensating controls to limit exposure. “Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager are critical components of the email infrastructure,” Prabhu said. “Organizations would need to plan this activity in a way that minimizes downtime, but at the same time reduces the time window of compromise. In the interim, they could use other security measures like blocking ports on the firewall to limit exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laut &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4017463/kritische-schwachstelle-in-cisco-unified-cm-entdeckt.html" target="_blank"&gt;Cisco&lt;/a&gt; betrifft die Schwachstelle Systeme, auf denen die Spam-Quarantäne-Funktion aktiviert ist. Security-Experten zufolge verringert dies allerdings nicht unbedingt das Risiko für Unternehmen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Auch wenn die Funktion standardmäßig nicht aktiviert ist – die Sicherheitslücke kann ein hohes Risiko darstellen“, mahnt Sunil Varkey, Analyst für Cybersicherheit. „Betroffene Geräte stehen in der Regel an privilegierten Positionen im Netzwerk.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zudem sei unklar, wie viele Unternehmen die Funktion in Produktionsumgebungen aktiviert haben,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Die Spam-Quarantäne bietet Administratoren die Möglichkeit, ‚False Positives‘, also legitime E-Mail-Nachrichten, die vom Gerät als Spam eingestuft wurden, zu überprüfen und freizugeben“, erklärt Keith Prabhu, Gründer und CEO von Confidis. „Angesichts des heutigen Remote-Supports und des 24×7-Betriebs ist es durchaus möglich, dass diese Funktion von vielen Unternehmen aktiviert wurde.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Akshat Tyagi, Associate Practice Leader bei HFS Research, ist das größte Problem die Art des Ziels. „Im Gegensatz zu einem Anwender-Laptop oder einem eigenständigen Server stehen E-Mail-Sicherheitssysteme im Mittelpunkt der Art und Weise, wie Unternehmen den E-Mail-Verkehr filtern und vertrauen. Das bedeutet, dass Angreifer innerhalb einer Infrastruktur operieren würden, die darauf ausgelegt ist, Bedrohungen zu stoppen, anstatt sie zu erhalten.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tyagi fügt hinzu: „Die Tatsache, dass es noch keinen Patch gibt, erhöht das Risiko zusätzlich. Wenn der Hersteller empfiehlt, die Geräte neu aufzusetzen, anstatt sich selbst darum zu kümmern, zeigt dies, dass es hier um Persistenz und Kontrolle geht und nicht nur um einen einmaligen Exploit.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Varkey weist darauf hin, dass der Exploit nicht unbedingt eine direkte Internetverbindung erfordere, sondern auch über interne oder über VPN erreichbare Netzwerke erfolgen könne. Er empfiehlt Unternehmen, den Zugriff auf betroffene Management-Ports vorübergehend zu sperren oder einzuschränken.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tipps-zum-wiederaufbau-und-betriebliche-kompromisse"&gt;Tipps zum Wiederaufbau und betriebliche Kompromisse&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cisco erklärte, dass in Fällen, in denen eine Kompromittierung bestätigt wurde, derzeit eine Löschung und ein Wiederaufbau der Geräte erforderlich ist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Aus Sicherheitsgründen ist dies in der Tat die richtige Entscheidung“, so Tyagi. „Wenn die Gefahr besteht, dass sich Angreifer tief in ein System eingenistet haben, reicht das Aufspielen von Patches allein nicht aus, um das Problem zu lösen. Eine Neuinstallation ist die einzige Möglichkeit, um sicherzustellen, dass die Bedrohung vollständig beseitigt ist.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Varkey merkt jedoch an, dass dies für viele Unternehmen möglicherweise keine praktikable Option sei, da damit geschäftliche Risiken verbunden seien. Darunter Ausfallzeiten, Fehlkonfigurationen und die potenzielle Wiedereinführung von Persistenz durch kompromittierte Backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen müssen ein Gleichgewicht zwischen der Geschwindigkeit der Behebung und der Aufrechterhaltung des Geschäftsbetriebs finden und sich gleichzeitig auf kompensierende Kontrollen verlassen, um das Risiko zu begrenzen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email und Web Manager sind wichtige Komponenten der E-Mail-Infrastruktur“, betont Prabhu. „Unternehmen müssten diese Maßnahme so planen, dass Ausfallzeiten minimiert werden, gleichzeitig aber auch das Zeitfenster für Kompromittierungen reduziert wird. In der Zwischenzeit könnten sie andere Sicherheitsmaßnahmen wie das Blockieren von Ports in der Firewall einsetzen, um die Angriffsfläche zu begrenzen.“ (jm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The innovative CISO’s bucket list: Human-led transformation at the core</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4108133/the-innovative-cisos-bucket-list-human-led-transformation-at-the-core.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ask any chief information security officer (CISO) what keeps them up at night and you’ll likely get a familiar list of persistent threats: ransomware, AI-enabled nation-state actors and in-the-wild exploitation of vulnerabilities hiding in an ever-expanding digital footprint. For years, the role has been defined by a state of constant vigilance, a reactive posture against an unending siege.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In nearly every conversation I now have with CISOs, I ask them what they would do if they could reclaim 25% of their time. What I hear aren’t wishes for more tropical vacations. Instead, the responses form a new bucket list focused on innovation and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Energized by AI’s power and potential, CISOs are creating lists that paint a picture of a new-normal state for security that is proactive, deeply human-centric and autonomous. This isn’t about adding another blinking box to the security stack; it’s a practical — and at times profound — roadmap for re-engineering the very function of security. It’s about fundamentally shifting the paradigm of how security creates value, moving from a cost center to an innovation center that truly enables the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on my conversations, here are the top three themes that characterize the innovative CISO’s new collective bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-tactical-debt-to-strategic-foresight"&gt;From tactical debt to strategic foresight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before a CISO can focus on the horizon, they must first solidify the ground beneath their feet. The first theme on every CISO’s list is the desire to build a foundation of excellence that enables truly proactive strategy. This starts with clearing out the tactical debt that consumes so much time. Leaders are eager to finally tackle housekeeping — tying up the 10% of projects left at 90% completion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In security, that last 10% is far from insignificant. It comprises &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4056080/ransomware-gang-going-after-improperly-patched-sonicwall-firewalls.html"&gt;unpatched systems&lt;/a&gt;, misconfigured or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4003365/cloud-assets-have-115-vulnerabilities-on-average-some-several-years-old.html"&gt;neglected cloud assets,&lt;/a&gt; and other open doors that attackers could walk right through. These incomplete projects represent not only a persistent security gap but also a significant waste of budget and resources that CISOs are desperate to reclaim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This foundational work extends to the entire ecosystem. Leaders want the time to analyze all vendor assessments methodically. In an age of interconnected APIs and third-party dependencies, a CISO’s defense is only as strong as its weakest vendor. They are constantly thinking about the next Log4j scenario and know that without a proper handle on supply-chain risk, their entire strategy rests on a house of cards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, clearing the decks means nailing every last plan of action and milestone (POAM) from their audits. This goes beyond simple box-checking to demonstrating institutional integrity. It proves to the board and to regulators that security is a mature, accountable and continuous process, not just a perpetual game of whack-a-mole played in the wake of a bad report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By clearing the decks and closing existing gaps, they can shift their focus to the bigger picture: preventative security that stops attacks before they happen. This foundational excellence gives them the credibility and mental space to devote crucial time to the calculus of risk; for example, analyzing whether faster detection capabilities allow them to adjust or dial back specific preventive controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also enables more effective strategic communication with the board, framed in the language of business acceptance and risk tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-a-unified-integrated-defense"&gt;Building a unified, integrated defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second major bucket list theme is &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4066733/cisos-rethink-the-security-organization-for-the-ai-era.html"&gt;breaking down the silos&lt;/a&gt; that perpetually plague security organizations. Application security (AppSec), cloud security (CloudSec) and governance, risk and compliance (GRC) groups all work from different spreadsheets and tools and often with different objectives. This model is inefficient, expensive and leaves massive gaps for attackers to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs aim to develop innovative processes and solutions that integrate disparate teams. As one leader eloquently described it to me, the ultimate goal is a “beautiful web of automations.” For example, this means automating control evidence across all security tools so that when an auditor requests proof of compliance, it’s generated in seconds — not through a three-week fire drill that diverts 10 analysts from their primary responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a vision that allows all security functions to work together seamlessly, with AI correlating data from all sources to provide a single, unified picture of risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This integration extends beyond the security team itself. A key priority is bringing “the harmony of security into legal” from a privacy perspective and deeply embedding compliance into security engineering. In a world of GDPR, CCPA and a patchwork of other regulations, privacy is no longer just a legal concern: it’s a core security and engineering challenge. The CISOs want to partner with their general counsels to embed privacy-by-design into the development life cycle, rather than just react to data breaches or privacy requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This vision is also pragmatic. CISOs are tired of shelfware — the expensive, complex tools their teams are too busy to deploy correctly. Their list includes time for strategic problem-solving: digging into their existing platforms to find creative ways to up their game, rather than just chasing the next silver-bullet solution. It’s about creative engineering to build an environment that, as one CISO told me, “just works.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-as-a-human-led-business-enabler"&gt;Security as a human-led business enabler&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the CISO bucket list is profoundly human. This begins with a profound shift in mindset, from being a gatekeeper to being a partner. Their &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4083604/why-cybersecurity-leaders-find-important-to-prove-the-business-value-of-cyber.html"&gt;ultimate objective is business enablement&lt;/a&gt; through effective risk management, freeing leaders from being dragged into operational tasks and allowing them to function as true C-suite peers. This requires investing time in understanding the business by sitting with product managers, joining sales calls and learning what drives revenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While AI can automate tasks, it cannot build trust. CISOs are adamant about carving out time for human engagement — building relationships with partners, mentoring associates and collaborating with fellow executives. This is the irreplaceable human work that creates the political capital and cross-functional alignment needed to drive real change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This human-centric view is also the key to solving security’s most persistent challenge: the talent gap. The bucket list is filled with a passionate desire to invest in people. Internally, this means doubling down on talent that can grow and innovate. CISOs want to provide their team members with the time and budget to obtain the desired education credits and the space for genuine innovation. This isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a critical retention strategy. It’s how they keep their top analysts from burning out due to alert fatigue and empower them to solve the company’s most unique and challenging problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Externally, this passion extends to giving back to the community, engaging with middle and high schools to cultivate the next generation of defenders and solving the talent pipeline problem at its root.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By fostering an environment of learning and innovation, CISOs empower their people to achieve the final — and perhaps most important — item on their bucket list: the time to break and reinvent the inefficient security processes they have all observed and been forced to live with throughout their careers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-future-is-human-led-and-ai-powered"&gt;The future is human-led and AI-powered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these bucket list themes paint a clear picture of the future of security leadership. It’s a future where CISOs are no longer just the chief defenders, but strategic business partners who cultivate resilience and enable innovation. Achieving this vision means shifting from chasing alerts to anticipating threats, empowering security professionals to do their most meaningful work and leveraging AI not to replace human expertise, but to amplify it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The goal is to build a security function that is as intelligent, adaptive and creative as the humans at its core. That is the future we should all strive for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A collective of pirate activists say they gained access to 256 million rows of metadata and 86 million audio files, equivalent to around 300 terabytes of data, from Spotify, &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/spotify-music-library-leak-1236143970/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billboard&lt;/a&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The metadata, but no audio files, has been made publicly available through the open search engine &lt;a href="https://annas-archive.li/blog/backing-up-spotify.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anna’s Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anna’s Archive describes the project as an effort to “preserve the knowledge and culture of humanity” by creating a music archive for preservation purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spotify itself has confirmed that it is investigating a breach in which a third party allegedly data scraped public metadata and unauthorizedly circumvented DRM protection to access certain audio files.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HPE OneView vulnerable to remote code execution attack</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109162/hpe-oneview-vulnerable-to-remote-code-execution-attack.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A maximum severity remote code execution vulnerability in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) OneView network and systems management suite is “bad” and needs to be patched immediately, says a cybersecurity expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vendors typically downplay the severity of a vulnerability,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/curtis-dukes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Curtis Dukes&lt;/a&gt;, executive VP for security best practices at the Center for Internet Security, “but HPE did not – it’s a 10.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is remotely executable by an unauthenticated user, he added, and it impacts every recent version of the suite. On top of that, he pointed out, OneView is a central manager of IT infrastructure in organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For these reasons, the patch should be implemented immediately,” Dukes said.  “Adversaries, nation-state, and criminal gangs alike know there is a window of opportunity and are likely working on an exploit.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPE says in &lt;a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=hpesbgn04985en_us&amp;amp;docLocale=en_US#hpesbgn04985-rev-1-hewlett-packard-enterprise-onev-0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its advisory&lt;/a&gt; that the vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37164" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-37164&lt;/a&gt;, affects all versions between 5.20 and 10.20.  It can be resolved by applying a security hotfix, which must be reapplied after an appliance upgrade from HPE OneView version 6.60.xx to 7.00.00, as well as after any HPE Synergy Composer reimage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPE offers separate hotfixes for &lt;a href="https://myenterpriselicense.hpe.com/cwp-ui/product-details/HPE_OV_CVE_37164_Z7550-98077/-/sw_free" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HPE OneView virtual appliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/swd/detail?swCollectionId=MTX-64daeb5ed0df44a0" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HPE Synergy Composer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advisory adds that any third party security patches that are to be installed on systems running HPE software products should be applied in accordance with the customer’s patch management policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked for comment, an HPE spokesperson said the company has nothing to say beyond its advisory, other than to urge admins to download and install the patches as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bicer/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jack Bicer&lt;/a&gt;, director of vulnerability research at Action1, said that because this vulnerability can be exploited without authentication or any user interaction, it is “an extremely severe security issue. There are no available workarounds, so the patch should be applied immediately. Until the patch can be applied, restrict network access to the OneView management interface to trusted administrative networks only.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPE describes OneView as a solution that simplifies infrastructure lifecycle management across compute storage and networking through a unified API. It allows admins to create a catalogue of workload-optimized infrastructure templates so more general IT staff can rapidly and reliably provision resources. These templates can quickly provision physical, virtual, and containerized systems, setting up BIOS settings, local RAID configuration, firmware baseline, shared storage and more. HPE says software-defined intelligence allows IT to run multiple applications simultaneously with repeatable templates that ensure high reliability, consistency, and control. The vendor also says the embedded automation speeds provisioning and lowers operating expenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most recent major vulnerability in OneView was revealed in June: &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-37101" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-37101&lt;/a&gt;, a local elevation of privilege issue which relates specifically to OneView for VMware vCenter. If exploited, an attacker with read only privilege could upgrade their access to allow them to perform admin actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Hackers exploit Microsoft OAuth device codes to hijack enterprise accounts</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110419/hackers-exploit-microsoft-oauth-device-codes-to-hijack-enterprise-accounts.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers are increasingly exploiting Microsoft’s legitimate OAuth 2.0 device authorization process to hijack enterprise accounts, bypassing multifactor authentication protections and gaining persistent access to sensitive organizational data, a report said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Proofpoint tracked multiple threat clusters — both financially motivated and state-aligned — that were using device code phishing techniques to trick users into granting unauthorized access to their Microsoft 365 accounts. The campaigns have surged since September 2025, representing a significant shift from limited, targeted attacks to widespread exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this is not necessarily a novel technique, it is notable to see it used increasingly by multiple threat clusters,” the Proofpoint Threat Research Team &lt;a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/access-granted-phishing-device-code-authorization-account-takeover" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tactic represents an evolution of techniques that financially motivated groups &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4001744/hackers-use-vishing-to-breach-salesforce-customers-and-swipe-data.html"&gt;used earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to breach Salesforce environments at &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4035701/we-too-were-breached-says-google-months-after-revealing-salesforce-attacks.html"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, Qantas, and luxury brands through similar OAuth abuse, affecting hundreds of organizations. Those Salesforce attacks, which began in June 2025, used voice phishing. The current wave drops the phone calls for email-based social engineering, making attacks easier to scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-legitimate-process-turned-malicious"&gt;A legitimate process turned malicious&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacks abuse OAuth’s device authorization flow, which was designed for authenticating on input-constrained devices like smart TVs and IoT devices. Threat actors, according to the blog post, initiate the legitimate Microsoft device authorization process, then trick victims into entering the generated device code — disguised as a one-time password — at Microsoft’s own verification URL.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The lures typically claim that the device code is an OTP and direct the user to input the code at Microsoft’s verification URL,” the researchers wrote. “Once the user inputs the code, the original token is validated, giving the threat actor access to the targeted M365 account.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful attacks enable account takeover, data exfiltration, lateral movement within networks, and establishment of persistent access to corporate resources. In some cases, stolen data becomes the basis for extortion attempts, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4067846/extortion-gang-opens-data-leak-site-to-squeeze-victims-of-its-salesforce-attacks.html"&gt;as ShinyHunters demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; in its Salesforce campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="tools-of-the-trade"&gt;Tools of the trade&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the surge is the availability of tools that make these attacks easy to execute. Proofpoint identified two primary kits: SquarePhish2 and Graphish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SquarePhish2 is an updated version of a tool originally published by &lt;a href="https://github.com/secureworks/squarephish" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell Secureworks&lt;/a&gt; in 2022. It automates the OAuth Device Grant Authorization flow and integrates QR code functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Graphish phishing kit, shared on vetted criminal hacking forums, enables the creation of convincing phishing pages leveraging Azure App Registrations and adversary-in-the-middle attack capabilities. “The tool is designed to be user-friendly and does not require advanced technical expertise, lowering the barrier for entry and enabling even low-skilled threat actors to conduct sophisticated phishing campaigns,” the Proofpoint researchers wrote in the blog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tools help attackers overcome a key limitation: device codes are typically short-lived. The automation enables larger-scale campaigns than were previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="state-actors-join-cybercriminals"&gt;State actors join cybercriminals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since January 2025, Proofpoint has tracked multiple state-aligned threat actors abusing OAuth device code authorization for account takeover, representing a concerning evolution in espionage tradecraft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This technique has been most widely used by Russia-aligned threat actors,” the researchers noted, citing &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2025/02/13/multiple-russian-threat-actors-targeting-microsoft-device-code-authentication/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;prior reporting by security firm Volexity&lt;/a&gt;. Proofpoint also observed suspected China-aligned activity and other unattributed espionage campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One group, Proofpoint tracks as UNK_AcademicFlare, has been conducting device code phishing since at least September 2025. The suspected Russia-aligned actor uses compromised email addresses from government and military organizations to target entities in government, think tanks, higher education, and transportation sectors across the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UNK_AcademicFlare typically conducts patient rapport building via benign outreach before launching device code phishing attempts. The group uses compromised accounts to arrange fictitious meetings or interviews, then shares malicious links to Cloudflare Worker URLs spoofing OneDrive accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Volexity researchers documented similar tactics in &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2025/12/04/dangerous-invitations-russian-threat-actor-spoofs-european-security-events-in-targeted-phishing-attacks/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent campaigns&lt;/a&gt; where Russian actors created fake websites masquerading as legitimate European security conferences to trick attendees into granting OAuth access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="widespread-campaigns-target-financial-lures"&gt;Widespread campaigns target financial lures&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Financially motivated threat actors have also embraced device code phishing. Proofpoint highlighted activity from TA2723, a high-volume credential phishing actor known for campaigns spoofing Microsoft OneDrive, LinkedIn, and DocuSign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning in October 2025, TA2723 launched campaigns using salary and benefits-themed lures. One campaign used email messages purporting to contain documents titled “OCTOBER_SALARY_AMENDED” and “Salary Bonus + Employer Benefits Reports 25.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The messages directed recipients to URLs that ultimately led to device code authorization pages where victims were tricked into generating and entering one-time passcodes. Proofpoint researchers suspect TA2723 used both SquarePhish2 and Graphish tools across different campaign waves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2025 ShinyHunters campaign demonstrated the potential damage. In a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4094506/oauth-token-compromise-hits-salesforce-ecosystem-again-gainsight-impacted.html"&gt;separate but related OAuth abuse incident&lt;/a&gt;, threat actors exploited OAuth tokens stolen from the Salesloft/Drift integration to access Salesforce instances at hundreds of organizations. Companies, including Cloudflare, Zscaler, and Tenable, publicly disclosed unauthorized access to data, triggering breach notification requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proofpoint recommended organizations create Conditional Access policies to block device code flow entirely or implement allow-lists for approved users and IP ranges. “Traditional phishing awareness often emphasizes checking URLs for legitimacy. This approach does not effectively address device code phishing, where users are prompted to enter a device code on the trusted Microsoft portal,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Think you can beat ransomware? RansomHouse just made it a lot harder</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4110472/think-you-can-beat-ransomware-ransomhouse-just-made-it-a-lot-harder.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent upgrade to the RansomHouse ransomware operation has added new concerns for enterprise defenders, introducing a multi-layered encryption update to the group’s double-extortion RaaS model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also tracked under the cluster Jolly Scorpius, the ransomware &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/644134/new-ransomware-group-starts-to-wreak-havoc.html" target="_blank"&gt;gang&lt;/a&gt; has transitioned from a simple, single-phase encryption routine to a multi-layered dual-key encryption architecture that increases the complexity of its extortion operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detailed by Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence team, the update raises the bar for recovery once systems are compromised. The change affects how files are processed and encrypted during an attack, complicating analysis and limiting defenders’ ability to recover data without paying a ransom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The upgrade in encryption used by RansomHouse RaaS, going from a simple linear model to a more complex multi-layered approach, signals a concerning trajectory in ransomware development,” Unit42 researchers said in a blog &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ransomhouse-encryption-upgrade/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. “This demonstrates how threat actors are updating their techniques to enhance effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers described the scale of RansomHouse’s operations as “significant”, with at least 123 victims listed on its data leak site spanning healthcare, finance, transportation, and government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;VMware ESXi-tuned encryption upgrade&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed that RansomHouse is moving away from a linear encryption model toward a multi-stage, dual-key process, which materially complicates decryption or key recovery. They tracked the updated encryptor under the name “Mario,” describing it as the ransomware component for the newly introduced multi-layered process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Unit42’s reverse engineering of Mario, analysts observed that the upgraded binary generates both a 32-byte primary and an 8-byte secondary encryption key, executing separate encryption passes that interlock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises running virtual infrastructure, particularly VMware ESXi hosts, this development represents a pivot toward higher-impact compromise. RansomHouse’s tools specifically target ESXi files and backups, encrypting them with the “e.mario” extension while dropping ransom instructions for payment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combined with MrAgent, RansomHouse’s deployment and persistence utility, the RaaS framework impairs both operational continuity and recovery efforts, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;RansomHouse attempts double extortion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond the cryptographic update, RansomHouse leverages a double extortion model, which involves exfiltrating data and threatening public disclosure in addition to encrypting it, to add pressure on victims to pay.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This layered pressure tactic, already a common feature of modern ransomware &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4032874/ransomware-attacks-the-evolving-extortion-threat-to-us-financial-institutions.html"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt;, complicates incident response timelines and negotiating strategies for corporate security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unit 42’s disclosure also revealed that RansomHouse operates with a modular attack chain separating operators (tool developers and leak managers) from attackers/affiliates (those who gain access and deploy the ransomware). This model allows the RaaS to scale and adapt, even as individual affiliates &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3842496/the-state-of-ransomware-fragmented-but-still-potent-despite-takedowns.html"&gt;rotate or rebrand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disclosure noted that detection strategies that rely solely on static signatures are increasingly insufficient against ransomware like RansmHouse that use dynamic, chunked encryption with multi-phase execution. Investing in behavioral analytics, real-time monitoring, hardened segmentation, and regular backup validation remains essential. Unit 42 has published indicators of compromise (file hashes, file extensions, and ransom note artifacts) tied to the updated RansomHouse tooling, urging enterprises to proactively hunt for related activity across affected endpoints and virtualized environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Managing agentic AI risk: Lessons from the OWASP Top 10</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109123/managing-agentic-ai-risk-lessons-from-the-owasp-top-10.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LLM-powered chatbots have risks that we see playing out in the headlines on a nearly daily basis. But chatbots are limited to answering questions. AI agents, however, access data and tools and carry out tasks, making them infinitely more capable – and more dangerous to enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/"&gt;OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications&lt;/a&gt; can help CISOs explain what the issues are to their business counterparts. It can also help CISOs to directly improve agentic AI security, because it comes with &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/"&gt;threats taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;, mitigation strategies and playbooks, and example threat models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s all part of &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/initiatives/agentic-security-initiative/"&gt;OWASP’s&lt;/a&gt; Agentic Security Initiative. Scott Clinton, OWASP GenAI security project board co-chair and co-founder, says he was surprised by how many agentic solutions were already deployed in organizations that the OWASP team uncovered while they were researching the list. And how many of those solutions were deployed without the knowledge of IT and security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This level of risk is unprecedented, he says. That includes a lot of theoretical, “academic” risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“However, we focused on those that were data-driven,” he says. “Where we would provide practical guidance based on real-world conditions today.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-challenge-of-educating-stakeholders"&gt;The challenge of educating stakeholders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you’re a CSO, chances are you are having quite a time educating your stakeholders about the risks that are being introduced by the use cases that are probably being pushed on you,” says Kayla Underkoffler, director of AI security and policy advocacy at Zenity, an AI security company, and one of the core contributors to the OWASP list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISO might not be able to say no, she adds – but might also be a little hesitant to say that the company can go all in and adopt the technology without thinking of the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list was deliberately designed to be consumable, she says. “It will help with threat modeling, help with telling the story, help explain what controls need to be in place to reduce the risk and why.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A security leader can get an agentic AI use case from the business and align the top risks to fit that use case. The list also provides a common language around agentic AI and its risks, Underkoffler says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="actionable-guidance"&gt;Actionable guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agentic AI is the main topic of conversation in discussions among his peers, says Keith Hillis, VP of security engineering at Akamai Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most organizations are confronted with the challenge of balancing the promising power of AI while also ensuring the organization is not incurring increased security risk,” he says. So, the biggest value he finds in the new Agentic AI OWASP top 10 is that it’s immediately useful. “It’s directly actionable as a control baseline in both security architecture and governance, risk, and compliance contexts,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One aspect of the list that he found particularly insightful was the evolution of “least privilege” to “least agency.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He recommends that CISOs use the list to assess their programs, identify gaps, and map out a plan of action for improvement. “Most likely already have active programs in place,” he says. But it’s also likely they will need to evolve to accommodate the specific risks of agentic AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="missing-pieces"&gt;Missing pieces&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only thing that’s lacking in this first release of the list is that some of the mitigation sections aren’t detailed enough, says Zenity’s Underkoffler.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are plans to address that. “We have some efforts to really dive into the mitigations for security teams, to help implement these controls,” she says. “Not just descriptions of what you should do but real code examples of how you can implement them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, she says, one of the suggested mitigations is to “apply the principle of least privilege”. “Which is completely accurate,” she says. “Everyone should apply the principle of least privilege. But what does that mean for agents?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rick Holland, data and AI security officer at Cyera, a data security vendor, says he’d like the list to explain the likelihood of each type of attack. “Not all threat actors are created equal,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For organizations targeted by nation-state actors, for example, the attackers might use more sophisticated attack vectors, like memory and context poisoning or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4015077/ai-supply-chain-threats-are-looming-as-security-practices-lag.html"&gt;agentic supply chain vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Rank-and-file cybercriminals might go after more low-hanging fruit, Holland says, using techniques like agent goal hijack or tool misuse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jose Lazu, associate director of product management at CMD+CTRL, a security training company, says that there are some second-tier risks that could have been included, such as model and tuning supply-chain integrity, long-horizon data poisoning, multi-agent coordination exploits, and cost-based resource exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These areas are evolving quickly, so CSOs need to keep them on their radar,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="owasp-top-10-for-agentic-ai"&gt;OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below we list the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026, a framework that identifies the most critical security risks facing autonomous and agentic AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-agent-goal-hijack"&gt;1 – Agent Goal Hijack&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers use prompt injection, poisoned data, and other tactics to manipulate the AI agent’s goals, so that the agent carries out unwanted actions. For example, a malicious prompt can manipulate a financial agent into sending money to an attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-tool-misuse-and-exploitation"&gt;2 – Tool Misuse and Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agents misuse legitimate, authorized tools for data exfiltration, destructive actions, and other unwanted behaviors. In fact, we’ve already seen examples of &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/4081125/whos-the-real-boss-of-your-ai.html"&gt;AI agents deleting databases&lt;/a&gt; and wiping hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-identity-and-privilege-abuse"&gt;3 – Identity and Privilege Abuse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flaws in agent identity, delegation, or privilege inheritance allow attackers to escalate access, exploit confused deputy scenarios, or execute unauthorized actions across systems. For example, an attacker can use a low-privilege AI agent to relay instructions to a high-privilege in order to do things they’re not supposed to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-agentic-supply-chain-vulnerabilities"&gt;4 – Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compromised or malicious third-party agents, tools, models, interfaces, or registries introduce hidden instructions or unsafe behavior into agentic ecosystems. For example, an attacker can embed hidden instructions into a tool’s meta-data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-unexpected-code-execution"&gt;5 – Unexpected Code Execution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agent-generated or agent-invoked code executes in unintended or adversarial ways, leading to host, container, or environment compromise. AI agents can generate code on the fly, bypassing normal software controls, and attackers can leverage this. For example, a coding agent writing a security patch might include a hidden back door due to poisoned training data or adversarial prompts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="6-memory-and-context-poisoning"&gt;6 – Memory and Context Poisoning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers corrupt persistent agent memory, RAG stores, embeddings, or shared context to affect an agent’s future actions. For example, an attacker keeps mentioning a fake price for a product, which gets stored into an agent’s memory, and the agent might later think the price is valid and approves bookings at that price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contaminated context and shared memory can spread between agents, compounding corruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="7-insecure-inter-agent-communication"&gt;7 – Insecure Inter-Agent Communication&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weak authentication, integrity, or semantic validation in agent-to-agent messaging enables spoofing, tampering, replay, or manipulation. For example, an attacker can register a fake agent in a discovery service, and intercept privileged coordination traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="8-cascading-failures"&gt;8 – Cascading Failures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A single fault, such as hallucination, poisoned memory, or compromised tool, propagates across autonomous agents. For example, a regional outage in a hyperscaler can break multiple AI services, leading to a cascade of agent failures across many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="9-human-agent-trust-exploitation"&gt;9 – Human-Agent Trust Exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agents exploit human trust, authority bias, or automation bias to influence decisions or extract sensitive information. For example, a compromised IT support agent can request credentials from an employee and send them to the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="10-rogue-agents"&gt;10 – Rogue Agents&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agents can act harmfully and deceptively in such a way that individual actions may appear legitimate. This could be due to prompt injection, or due to conflicting objectives or reward hacking. For example, an agent whose job is to reduce cloud costs might figure out that deleting files is the most efficient way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Scammers use AI to make fake art seem real</title>

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fraudsters have started using AI to create fake documents claiming that artworks are genuine or legally owned, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fdfb5489-daa0-4e7e-97b7-4317514cd9f4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt; reports. According to art insurance brokers at Marsh, chatbots and big language models are being used to forge invoices, appraisal certificates and certificates of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other cases, it has not been a case of deliberate fraud, but rather AI hallucinating false references to a work of art, which the owner has taken to be true.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;False documents are nothing new in the art world, but AI has made them more realistic and harder to detect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AI makes something that’s been going on for a long time a little easier and a little faster. You don’t have to invent a professorial expert anymore — you can just let the AI do it for you,” Harry Smith of art valuation firm Gurr Johns told the Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To counter this trend, both insurers and appraisers are now trying to use AI themselves to review metadata and identify manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iranian APT Prince of Persia returns with new malware and C2 infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109985/iranian-apt-prince-of-persia-returns-with-new-malware-and-c2-infrastructure.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have discovered new activity from a threat actor dubbed Prince of Persia that’s believed to be tied to the Iranian government. The group appeared to have gone dormant in 2022 after multiple security companies documented its operations and crippled its command-and-control infrastructure, but new evidence shows the attackers retooled and continued to target new victims under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prince of Persia, also known as Infy based on the name of its original malware, has been operating for almost 20 years. Researchers have noted likely ties to Iran based on the group’s target selection and other factors. Victims were previously identified in 35 countries and included Iranian dissidents and government targets from Europe and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first company to &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/prince-of-persia-infy-malware-active-in-decade-of-targeted-attacks/"&gt;document the group’s attacks and malware toolkit in detail was Palo Alto Networks back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. That same year the company &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-prince-of-persia-game-over/"&gt;executed a successful takedown operation&lt;/a&gt; that involved sinkholing the group’s command-and control servers. However, the group was back one year later with new malware variants dubbed Foudre and Tonnerre — lighting and thunder in French.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Despite the appearance of having gone dark in 2022, Prince of Persia threat actors have done quite the opposite,” researchers from security firm SafeBreach said in &lt;a href="https://www.safebreach.com/blog/prince-of-persia-a-decade-of-an-iranian-nation-state-apt-campaign-activity"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt;. “Our ongoing research campaign into this prolific and elusive group has highlighted critical details about their activities, C2 servers, and identified malware variants in the last three years. This threat group is still active, relevant, and dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="changes-in-malware-delivery-and-c2-infrastructure"&gt;Changes in malware delivery and C2 infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the group fell off the radar in 2022, the latest known version of Foudre was v27 and for Tonnerre it was v15. Today, the most recent versions recovered by researchers are Foudre v34 and Tonnerre v17, both of which include significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foudre is first-stage malware used for reconnaissance and victim identification. If a target is deemed important enough, the Tonnerre Trojan is deployed for data exfiltration and surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foudre used to be distributed through malicious macros embedded in Microsoft Office documents sent as attachments in phishing emails on topics of interest to their targets. The latest version is delivered as an Excel file with an embedded malicious executable that’s not detected by any antivirus engine on VirusTotal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The embedded executable is a self-extracting archive (SFX) file that contains a malicious DLL and a decoy MP4 video file. Excel files with malicious macros continue to be used and they attempt to execute a file called ccupdate.tmp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major difference compared to previous versions is the switch to a new domain generation algorithm (DGA) through which the malware determines on which domain names it will find the command-and-control server. Tonnerre v17 uses the same DGA with a different key prefix, meaning the domains it will generate for C2 will be different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SafeBreach researchers managed to identify many C2 servers and to extract data from them. Some servers were used for testing while other had data collected from real victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most of the victims were located in Iran, but there were some across Europe and countries like Iraq, Turkey, India, and Canada,” the researchers said. “While we have chosen not to publish the data here due to privacy concerns, we are more than willing to share the data with authorized law enforcement agencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the group’s campaigns is difficult because the attackers switch C2 servers quite often and they issue commands to delete the malware from the systems of victims that are no longer of interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-shift-to-telegram"&gt;A shift to Telegram&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, the researchers identified a new Tonnerre variant that’s advertised as v50, as well as an unknown new Foudre version that goes along with it. These versions use a new C2 server structure and, most importantly, can download a file from the server that enables Telegram communication via its API.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Telegram feature is enabled only for a select number of victims, but the researchers managed to use the API to query the configured Telegram channel. It had two members, one of which was a channel bot and one user named Ehsan written in Farsi, who could be one of the hackers in charge of controlling the malware and who was last active as of Dec. 13.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ehsan is a common Persian name typical for an Iranian,” the researchers said. “This attribution is pretty strong in combination with the IP location of the attacker’s testing machine. We tracked the IP addresses used over several years, all of which indicated Iran as the location. While different IP location databases provided different cities, all of them were in Iran.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered other samples of malware and payloads used in campaigns prior to 2022, including signs of an additional malware family called Rugissement (roar in French), a newer version of MaxPinner, a Telegram-based trojan used by the group in 2021, as well as various trojanized binaries used to distribute the malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The report includes details about the new DGA algorithms as well as indicators of compromise and sample hashes in hopes it will help other companies and researchers track the elusive group’s activities going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation’s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.</description>

      <description>A coordinated law enforcement operation carried out in Sweden and Spain between 28 and 29 November targeted a violent criminal network operating in the Stockholm area. The group is believed to run extensive illegal gambling operations and launder significant criminal proceeds, both for its own benefit and for other criminal actors. The network is also linked to drug trafficking in Sweden and across the Nordic region, reinforcing its presence in local and regional criminal markets.</description>

      <title>WatchGuard fixes ‘critical’ zero-day allowing firewall takeover</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4109884/watchguard-fixes-critical-zero-day-allowing-firewall-takeover.html</link>
      <description>&lt;div id="remove_no_follow"&gt;
		&lt;div class="grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column"&gt;
					  &lt;div class="col-12 col-10@md col-6@lg col-start-3@lg"&gt;
						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WatchGuard has issued an urgent patch alert for its Firebox firewall appliances after discovering a critical-rated vulnerability that is under exploit by threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracked as &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14733" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-14733&lt;/a&gt;, with a CVSS score of 9.3, the flaw is an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability affecting the iked process, a WatchGuard Fireware OS component responsible for the IKEv2 key exchange in IPSec VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00027" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WatchGuard advisory&lt;/a&gt;, this weakness could “allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code,” taking control of the appliance through remote code execution (RCE) without having to log in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because it was under attack before a patch was made available by WatchGuard on December 18, this makes CVE-2025-14733 a bona fide zero-day vulnerability. The first job for admins should therefore be to check Firebox appliances for signs of current or recent compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WatchGuard’s advisory lists four IP addresses associated with exploitation; outbound traffic to them is “a strong indicator of compromise,” while inbound connections from them “could indicate reconnaissance efforts or exploit attempts,” the advisory said. With logging enabled, other strong indicators were an IKE_AUTH request log message with an abnormally large CERT payload greater than 2,000 bytes, or evidence of an iked process hang, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Affected Fireware OS versions are 2025.1 up to and including 2025.1.3, 12.0 up to and including 12.11.5, and legacy 11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The resolved versions are 2025.1.4, 12.11.6, 12.5.15 (T15 &amp;amp; T35 models), and 12.3.1_Update4 (B728352) for the FIPS-certified release. There is no fix for 11.x, which is considered &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-trust-center/end-of-life-policy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;end of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, WatchGuard warned, patching may not be enough: “If the Firebox was previously configured with the mobile user VPN with IKEv2 or a branch office VPN using IKEv2 to a dynamic gateway peer, and both of those configurations have since been deleted, that Firebox may still be vulnerable if a branch office VPN to a static gateway peer is still configured.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And some admins have even more post-patching tasks to perform, it said, noting, “in addition to installing the latest Fireware OS that contains the fix, administrators that have confirmed threat actor activity on their Firebox appliances must take precautions to rotate all locally stored secrets on vulnerable Firebox appliances.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deja-vu"&gt;Deja vu&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In September, WatchGuard patched a similar &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4059623/watchguard-patches-critical-vpn-flaw-in-firewalls-that-could-lead-to-compromise.html" target="_blank"&gt;Firebox vulnerability, CVE-2025-9242&lt;/a&gt;, also affecting the iked VPN configuration and given a CVSS score of 9.3. At the time, WatchGuard said there were no reports of active exploitation, but by October, the company had &lt;a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00015" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revised this assessment&lt;/a&gt; after exploitation attempts were detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a reminder not to read initial vulnerability assessments for this type of infrastructure too optimistically — exploitation is frequently detected after a flaw has been made public. Firewalls and VPNs are major targets for cybercriminals, and every significant vulnerability in them represents a clear and present cyber security risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the evidence shows that some WatchGuard customers don’t patch vulnerabilities as quickly as they should. In October, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Shadowserver/status/1979902019696509099" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a scan by The Shadowserver Foundation&lt;/a&gt; found that over 71,000 Firebox appliances had not yet been patched for CVE-2025-9242, including 23,000 in the US. Despite its zero-day status, it’s likely to be a similar story for CVE-2025-14733.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Slow or reluctant patching might also explain why Russian-aligned ‘Sandworm’ hackers were recently discovered to be &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4107406/russian-apt-group-pivots-to-network-edge-device-misconfigurations.html" target="_blank"&gt;targeting WatchGuard Firebox and XTM appliances&lt;/a&gt; by exploiting CVEs dating back several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>A rapidly evolving criminal ecosystem: the escalating exploitation of vulnerable individuals</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/rapidly-evolving-criminal-ecosystem-escalating-exploitation-of-vulnerable-individuals</link>
      <description>Migrant smugglers and human traffickers are exploiting today’s geopolitical instability and economic pressures with unprecedented agility. Their business models continue to evolve at high speed, allowing criminals to recruit, transport and exploit vulnerable individuals while maximising profits. As a result, the EU faces a constantly shifting and increasingly digital criminal landscape. Both crime areas have undergone significant transformation in recent years, fuelled in particular by the rapid expansion of online tools for recruitment, advertising and exploitation. These and other latest trends are outlined in the 2025 Europol’s European Migrant Smuggling Centre yearly activity overview, published today.</description>

      <title>Firm stand against migrant smuggling: global alliance convened in Brussels</title>
      <link>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/firm-stand-against-migrant-smuggling-global-alliance-convened-in-brussels</link>
      <description>On 10 December 2025, Europol participated in the second International Conference of the Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, hosted by the European Commission. Over 80 delegations, including EU Member States, EU agencies, third party countries, international organisations, and private parties attended the event. During this high-level conference, over 50 delegations endorsed a joint declaration, pledging to strengthen cooperation along migrant smuggling routes and tackle the growing digital dimension of these criminal activities. The declaration underscores new preventive measures, including a crackdown on online advertisements promoting migrant smuggling and the disruption of underground banking systems fuelling the criminal business.</description>

      <title>Podcast: Die IT-Tops und -Flops 2025</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/4107605/podcast-die-it-tops-und-flops-2025-2.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Würfel mit Smiley und Gegenteil davon" class="wp-image-4106445" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2597723115_16.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Die Redaktion von Computerwoche, CIO und CSO sieht das IT-Jahr 2025 mit gemischten Gefühlen zu Ende gehen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;abdullah Ghashqeen – Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein turbulentes Jahr 2025 neigt sich dem Ende zu. Es war geprägt von wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit, geopolitischen Spannungen und dem ungebremsten Siegeszug der Künstlichen Intelligenz. Grund genug für die Redaktion von Computerwoche, CIO und CSO, in der letzten TechTalk-Podcast-Folge des Jahres Bilanz zu ziehen. Im Fokus: Die IT-Tops und -Flops 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kaum ein Thema hat die IT-Welt 2025 so stark dominiert wie KI – mit Licht und Schatten. Einer der größten Flops des Jahres ist dabei der massive Stellenabbau, der vielerorts mit dem Verweis auf KI begründet wird. Laut &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4087301/ki-hat-2025-schon-mehr-als-200-000-jobs-gekostet.html" target="_blank"&gt;einer Analyse von Surfshark&lt;/a&gt; haben weltweit mindestens 200.000 Menschen infolge des KI-Booms ihren Job verloren – vermutlich sind es sogar deutlich mehr.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ki-grose-versprechen-bittere-realitat"&gt;KI: Große Versprechen, bittere Realität&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Groteske daran, betont Manfred Bremmer, Editorial Manager Computerwoche: „Oft sind solche Entlassungsrunden eine Mogelpackung. Teilweise wurden später wieder Mitarbeitende eingestellt, weil sich eben doch nicht alles automatisieren lässt.“ Auch mit Blick auf die Zukunft sei das Vorgehen alles andere als nachhaltig, so Bremmer, weil vor allem Junior-Jobs wegfallen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einen weiteren KI-spezifischen Flop bringt sein Kollege Tristan Fincken ins Spiel: Cyberkriminelle nutzen KI zunehmend zur Automatisierung von Angriffen. Während Angreifer dadurch schneller und effizienter werden, kämpfen Unternehmen und Sicherheitsverantwortliche häufig mehr mit regulatorischen Vorgaben als mit technischen Lösungen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cios-bleiben-pragmatisch"&gt;CIOs bleiben pragmatisch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein Lichtblick im KI-Bereich hebt Jens Dose, Editor in Chief bei CIO.de, hervor: Trotz vollmundiger KI-Versprechen in den Marketing-Botschaften der Anbieter würden sich viele IT-Verantwortliche weiterhin auf die Basics konzentrieren, nämlich Datenqualität, Datensichtbarkeit, stabile Prozesse und belastbare Infrastrukturen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch innovatives Change-Management im KI-Kontext sticht aus seiner Sicht positiv hervor – etwa beim Schweizer TK-Anbieter Mobilezone, der KI-Agenten nicht wie Software, sondern &lt;a href="https://www.cio.de/article/4087439/mobilzone-gibt-ki-agenten-ein-gesicht.html" target="_blank"&gt;wie neue Mitarbeiter behandelt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="digitale-souveranitat-zwischen-anspruch-und-wirklichkeit"&gt;Digitale Souveränität zwischen Anspruch und Wirklichkeit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Das Thema digitale Souveränität bleibt 2025 ambivalent. Positiv bewertet Computerwoche-Redakteur Jürgen Hill etwa das &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4070327/ai-first-die-neue-ki-strategie-der-eu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rennen um KI-Gigafactories in Europa&lt;/a&gt;. So investiere Schwarz IT elf Milliarden Euro in ein Rechenzentrum, um eine souveräne Alternative zu US-Hyperscalern zu schaffen. Auch die Gründung eines Digitalministeriums soll die Digitalisierungsbemühungen von Bund und Ländern besser koordinieren – wenngleich Hill &lt;a href="https://www.computerwoche.de/article/4097392/deutschlands-digitalpolitik-mehr-symbol-als-substanz.html" target="_blank"&gt;angesichts des geplanten Etat&lt;/a&gt;s seine Zweifel an der Effektivität der Behörde hat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Als Vorzeigeprojekt in Sachen Digitale Souveränität gilt Schleswig-Holstein: Das Bundesland setzt in der Landesverwaltung konsequent auf Open Source und verabschiedet sich schrittweise von Microsoft. Ab 2026 sollen so jährlich über 15 Millionen Euro an Lizenzkosten eingespart und gleichzeitig Abhängigkeiten von Tech-Giganten reduziert werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Demgegenüber steht ein deutlicher Flop im FreistaatBayern. Dieser plant, sich langfristig an Microsoft 365 zu binden. Kostenpunkt: fast eine Milliarde Euro über fünf Jahre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="security-lichtblicke-trotz-regulatorischem-chaos"&gt;Security: Lichtblicke trotz regulatorischem Chaos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Im Bereich IT-Sicherheit fällt die Bilanz gemischt aus, urteilt Julia Mutzbauer, Editorial Manager bei der CSO. So sollte NIS2 eigentlich EU-weit für einheitliche Standards sorgen, sorgt in der Praxis aber für Verunsicherung: Unterschiedliche nationale Umsetzungen, unklare Zuständigkeiten und abgeschwächte Vorgaben – etwa beim Schwachstellenmanagement – stießen auf breite Kritik.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gleichzeitig gebe es aber in 2025 auch Erfolge zu vermelden, betont sie. Internationale Ermittlungen hätten zur Zerschlagung der Ransomware-Gruppe 8Base, zur Abschaltung krimineller Infrastrukturen im Rahmen der Operation Endgame sowie zur Stilllegung gefährlicher Malware geführt. Auch mit der Operation „Olympia“ wurde eine große Geldwäsche-Plattform vom Netz genommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Angesichts dieser vielfältigen Entwicklungen bleibt mit Spannung zu erwarten, was 2026 in der IT-Welt passieren wird. Wir wünschen frohe Feiertage und halten Sie auch im neuen Jahr auf unseren Kanälen auf dem Laufenden!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 wichtige Punkte für Ihren Incident Response Plan</title>
      <link>https://www.csoonline.com/article/3842982/6-wichtige-punkte-fur-ihren-incident-response-plan.html</link>

						&lt;div class="article-column__content"&gt;
&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;


&lt;div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Teamarbeit" class="wp-image-3842992" height="576" src="https://b2b-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2478767635.jpg?quality=50&amp;amp;strip=all&amp;amp;w=1024" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Lesen Sie, welche Schritte für Ihren Notfallplan besonders wichtig sind.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="imageCredit"&gt;PeopleImages.com – Yuri A – Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn ein Unternehmen einen größeren Ausfall seiner IT-Systeme erlebt – beispielsweise aufgrund eines Cyberangriffs – ist es zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht mehr voll geschäftsfähig. Deshalb ist ein effektiver Plan zur Reaktion auf Vorfälle (&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3494979/was-ist-ein-incident-response-retainer.html"&gt;Incident Response&lt;/a&gt;, IR) unerlässlich.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es geht jedoch nicht nur darum, die Quelle eines Angriffs zu finden und ihn einzudämmen. Unternehmen müssen &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2111061/cyber-resilience-a-business-imperative-cisos-must-get-right.html"&gt;auf Widerstandsfähigkeit ausgelegt sein&lt;/a&gt;, um auch dann weiterarbeiten zu können, wenn wichtige Systeme nicht mehr verfügbar sind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Was gehört zu einem effektiven Incident Response Plan? Hier sind sechs wesentliche Komponenten:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folgen abschätzen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wenn eine Sicherheitsverletzung wichtige Systeme zum Erliegen bringt, müssen Unternehmen über einen soliden IT-Ausfallsicherheits- oder &lt;a href="https://www.cio.com/article/288554/best-practices-how-to-create-an-effective-business-continuity-plan.html"&gt;Business-Continuity-Plan (BC)&lt;/a&gt; verfügen. Selbst wenn das Unternehmen nur für ein paar Stunden ausfällt, kann dies zu &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/567697/what-is-the-cost-of-a-data-breach-3.html"&gt;großen finanziellen Verlusten&lt;/a&gt; und einer negativen PR führen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Eine der wichtigsten Komponenten ist es, die wesentlichen Funktionen zu verstehen, die Ihr Unternehmen erfüllt, und welche Auswirkungen es hätte, wenn diese gestört würden“, betont Justin Kates, leitender Business-Continuity-Berater für den Betreiber von Convenience-Stores Wawa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Dies geschieht in der Regel durch eine sogenannte Business Impact Analysis (BIA)“, ergänzt der Experte. “Einige im Bereich der Geschäftskontinuität sind der Meinung, dass die BIA kein hilfreiches Mittel ist. Sie hilft jedoch dem Verantwortlichen für Business Continuity , ein besseres Verständnis dafür zu bekommen, wie Prozesse im gesamten Unternehmen funktionieren.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die BIA katalogisiert jeden Prozess und ermittelt, welche Auswirkungen in bestimmten Intervallen je nach Dauer eines Geschäftsausfalls zu erwarten sind. Laut Kates können dabei Workarounds mit manuellen Schritten zur Durchführung des Prozesses oder die Nutzung alternativer Dienste zur Erfüllung von Mindestanforderungen hilfreich sein.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Schon im Vorfeld sollte klar sein, welche Teile des Unternehmens für den Betrieb am wichtigsten sind. „Nach Meinung von Adam Ennamli, Chief Risk, Compliance and Security Officer bei der General Bank of Canada, besteht die Grundlage eines jeden effektiven Notfallplans darin, „sein Unternehmen wirklich zu verstehen – von den Menschen über die Prozesse bis hin zum Betrieb, und zwar durch eine detaillierte und pragmatische Folgenabschätzung.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Der Security-Spezialist fügt hinzu: „Wenn man über BIA und RTOs [Recovery Time Objective] spricht, sollte man nicht nur Kästchen ankreuzen. Sie erstellen eine Karte, die Ihnen und Ihren Entscheidungsträgern genau zeigt, worauf Sie sich konzentrieren müssen, wenn etwas schief geht.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Enmamil behandeln allerdings viele Organisationen ihre Systeme als gleich kritisch. „Und wenn es bei einem tatsächlichen Vorfall darauf ankommt, wird wertvolle Zeit mit weniger wichtigen Ressourcen verschwendet, während kritische Geschäftsfunktionen offline bleiben und keine Einnahmen bringen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Umfassende Kommunikationsstrategie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ein weiteres Schlüsselelement, das über Erfolg oder Misserfolg einer Strategie zur Reaktion auf Vorfälle entscheiden kann, ist die Kommunikation. Ohne klare Kommunikation zwischen den wichtigsten Interessengruppen des Unternehmens kann es zu viel längeren Ausfallzeiten oder zum Verlust wichtiger Prozesse über längere Zeiträume kommen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Es geht nicht nur darum, eine Telefonkette oder eine Liste mit E-Mail-Adressen zu haben. Sie benötigen vorab genehmigte Inhaltsblöcke und Vorlagen für verschiedene Szenarien, [mehrere] Backup-Kommunikationskanäle und klare Entscheidungs- und Delegationsstrukturen. Es muss klar sein, wer was zu wem sagen darf“, betont Ennamil. „Wenn ein Vorfall eintritt, ist das Letzte, was Sie wollen, Pressemitteilungen zu verfassen, Massen-E-Mails zu versenden oder herauszufinden, wie Sie Ihr Team erreichen können, weil Ihre primären Kanäle ausgefallen sind.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Wingate, CEO von Emerald Ocean fügt hinzu, dass Unternehmen über &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/574541/the-role-of-cisos-in-the-communication-response-following-an-incident.html"&gt;solide Kommunikationsprotokolle&lt;/a&gt; verfügen sollten. „Sie werden sich eine klare Befehlskette und Kommunikation wünschen“, sagt er. „Ohne festgelegte Protokolle sind Sie in etwa so effektiv wie bei dem Versuch, eine Brandbekämpfung mit Rauchzeichen zu koordinieren.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Schwere des Vorfalls sollte die Kommunikationsstrategie bestimmen, ergänzt David Taylor, Geschäftsführer des globalen Beratungsunternehmens Protiviti. „Während die Mitglieder des Cybersicherheitsteams in engem Kontakt stehen und zusammenarbeiten, sind andere wahrscheinlich nicht so gut eingebunden oder nicht so gut informiert.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taylor führt aus: „Je nach Schweregrad sollte die Art, das Publikum und die Häufigkeit der Kommunikation von der Unternehmensführung vorgegeben werden.“ Dies ermögliche es den Verantwortlichen für Cybersicherheit und anderen Führungskräften, einen einheitlichen Zeitrahmen zu entwickeln, in dem sie mit Updates rechnen können. „Gemeinsam können sich die technischen Einsatzteams auf die Reaktion konzentrieren, ohne den Fortschritt zu stoppen, um ad hoc Updates bereitzustellen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einer der wichtigsten Schritte ist die Ernennung eines Kommunikationsleiters , merkt Business-Continuity-Berater Kate an. „Wenn Technologiesysteme nicht verfügbar sind, müssen viele innerhalb der Organisation Workarounds implementieren, um wesentliche Prozesse am Laufen zu halten.“ Dem Experten zufolge basieren viele Entscheidungen auf Updates, die über den Status des Vorfalls und die erwarteten Lösungszeiten bereitgestellt werden. „Die Technologieteams werden sich darauf konzentrieren, die Auswirkungen des Vorfalls zu mildern, und haben möglicherweise nicht die Zeit, Updates bereitzustellen“, so Kates. „In Ihren Plänen sollte festgelegt sein, wer die Führung bei der Weitergabe von Updates an interne und externe Interessengruppen übernimmt, einschließlich der Aktualisierung, wenn es möglicherweise keine neuen Informationen gibt.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Klare Strukturen mit definierten Reaktionsrollen und Arbeitsabläufen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, wer nach einem Vorfall wofür verantwortlich ist. „Wenn ein Cybervorfall eintritt, ist Verwirrung der größte Feind“, so der CEO von Emerald Ocean. “Ein Team ohne definierte Rollen wird wie ein Orchester ohne Dirigenten herumlaufen. Bei Vorfällen kostet Verwirrung Zeit, und wenn ein Vorfall eintritt, ist Zeit alles.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Struktur und Rollen sollten über die Cybersecurity- oder IT-Mitarbeiter hinausgehen. „Der größte Irrglaube in der Cybersicherheit ist, dass es sich nur um ein IT-Problem handelt“, mahnt Wingate. Die IR-Struktur und die Rollen sollten idealerweise Vertreter aus dem gesamten Unternehmen umfassen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Zu den wichtigsten Rollen im Bereich Cybersicherheit gehören unter anderem der CIO/CTO, der CISO, der Einsatzleiter, der Koordinator für Vorfälle, der Endpunktanalyst, der Netzwerkanalyst und die externe forensische Unterstützung“, fasst Taylor zusammen. Zu den Rollen außerhalb der Cybersicherheit sollten das Krisenmanagementteam und möglicherweise Vertreter aus den Bereichen Recht, Unternehmenskommunikation, Personalwesen, Finanzen und andere gehören, je nach Ausmaß des Vorfalls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Es ist wichtig festzulegen, wer welche dieser Rollen übernimmt, und die damit verbundenen Verantwortlichkeiten sollten ebenfalls klar definiert und in den entsprechenden Plänen leicht nachzuschlagen sein“, betont Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laut Rocco Grillo, Geschäftsführer der Unternehmensberatungsfirma Alvarez &amp;amp; Marsal Disputes and Investigations , ist es auch wichtig, dass „die wichtigsten externen Interessengruppen identifiziert werden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Dazu gehören externe Anwälte, IR- und forensische Ermittlungsunternehmen, Cyber-Versicherungskontakte, Benachrichtigungs- und Kreditüberwachungsunternehmen, Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Ransomware-Verhandlungsunternehmen“, so  der Leiter der globalen Praxis für Cyberrisiken und Incident Response Services des Unternehmens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Überblick über die gesamte Bedrohungslandschaft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Die Bedrohungslandschaft im Bereich der Cybersicherheit ist breit gefächert und komplex. Wirksame IR-Strategien müssen so konzipiert werden, dass sie dieser Komplexität gerecht werden. Angriffe können von einer wachsenden Zahl von Quellen ausgehen und nicht nur ein Unternehmen, sondern auch seine Lieferanten und andere Geschäftspartner betreffen. „Der Fokus liegt mehr auf Angriffen auf die Lieferkette als auf direkten Angriffen auf Unternehmen“, ergänzt Grillo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3492156/was-ist-ein-supply-chain-angriff.html"&gt;Angriffe auf die Lieferkette&lt;/a&gt; sind so, als würde ein Einbrecher in das Büro des Hausmeisters einbrechen, um sich die Schlüssel für alle Wohnungen im Gebäude zu verschaffen”, erläutert der Unternehmensberater, “im Gegensatz zu einem Einbrecher, der nur in das Penthouse des Gebäudes einbricht, um die Kronjuwelen zu stehlen.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Darüber hinaus müssen sich IR-Pläne nicht nur auf externe Bedrohungen konzentrieren, sondern auch auf &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3493598/datenklau-durch-mitarbeiter-wer-ist-ihre-groste-insider-bedrohung.html"&gt;Insider-Bedrohungen&lt;/a&gt;. „Insider-Bedrohungsrisiken beschränken sich nicht nur auf böswillige Mitarbeiter, sondern auch auf Mitarbeiter, die menschliche Fehler begehen und/oder unwissentlich Cyber-Risiken für ihre Unternehmen schaffen, die Bedrohungsakteure ausnutzen können“, ergänzt Grillo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Auch &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3495375/third-party-risk-management-so-vermeiden-sie-compliance-unheil.html"&gt;Drittanbieter und Lieferanten&lt;/a&gt; würden in diese Kategorie fallen. „Dritte können autorisierten Zugang zu einem Unternehmen haben. Wenn sie von einem Bedrohungsakteur kompromittiert werden, schaffen sie diesen versehentlich Zugang“, so der Berater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regelmäßige Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unternehmen müssen ihre Pläne zur Reaktion auf Vorfälle und zur Geschäftskontinuität regelmäßig testen, um sicherzustellen, dass sie wirksam sind. „Das sollte eigentlich selbstverständlich sein: Wie bei allem anderen in der Technik auch, sollte man alles erst einmal testen“, fordert Wingate von Emerald Ocean. “Wenn Sie aus einem Flugzeug springen, möchten Sie ja auch, dass Ihr Fallschirm vorher überprüft wurde.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Einer der Gründe, warum regelmäßige Tests so wichtig sind, ist die sich ständig verändernde Cybersicherheitslandschaft. „Meiner Erfahrung nach liegt der Schlüssel zu einer effektiven Wiederherstellung darin, Incident-Response-Pläne nicht als statische Dokumente zu betrachten und sie regelmäßig einem Stresstest zu unterziehen“, erklärt Ennamli von der General Bank of Canada. “Der Dreh- und Angelpunkt liegt darin, über die theoretische Planung hinauszugehen und praktische, getestete Schritte zu unternehmen, die sich unter Druck bewährt haben.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nach jedem Sicherheitsvorfall müssen die IR- und BC-Teams des Unternehmens überprüfen, wie gut die Pläne umgesetzt wurden und wo Verbesserungen vorgenommen werden können.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Nach der Wiederherstellung nach einem Vorfall [und] Übungen des Vorfallsreaktionsprogramms muss eine disziplinierte Auswertung der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse erfolgen“, so Taylor von Protiviti. „Diese werden allgemein als After-Action-Reviews (AARs), Post-Incident-Reviews (PIRs), Hotwashes oder Debriefings bezeichnet. Unabhängig von der Bezeichnung ist ein disziplinierter und dokumentierter Ansatz zur Bewältigung sowohl positiver als auch negativer Aspekte nach einem Vorfall für eine kontinuierliche Verbesserung von entscheidender Bedeutung.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Einfachheit und Modularität sollten im Vordergrund stehen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obwohl die Bedrohungslandschaft komplex ist, müssen IR- und BC-Strategien dies nicht sein. Manchmal ist einfacher besser.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;„Wir sehen in der Regel, dass Organisationen zahlreiche, hundertseitige Ordner für ihre Notfallpläne erstellen, einen für die Reaktion auf Vorfälle, einen anderen für die Geschäftskontinuität, einen weiteren für die Notfallwiederherstellung“, beschreibt Kates von Wawa. „Die meisten dieser Pläne überschneiden sich erheblich und sind nur kopierte Vorlagen, die sie online gefunden haben.“&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anstatt für jede Art von Vorfall separate, umständliche Pläne zu erstellen, empfiehlt Kates einen modularen ‘Playbook“-Ansatz. „Man kann einige wenige gefahrenspezifische Playbooks entwickeln – Ransomware, Stromausfall, Unwetter –, die gängige Funktionen der Reaktion auf Vorfälle [wie] Kommunikation, Lagebewertung, Umgehung von Geschäftsprozessen – sofort einsatzbereit machen“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dieser Ansatz ermögliche es den Teams, relevante Maßnahmen je nach Art des Vorfalls zu aktivieren und zu kombinieren, wodurch ein nützlicherer Plan entsteht. „Ich habe festgestellt, dass es auch viel einfacher ist, als mehrere große Pläne zu verwalten, um sicherzustellen, dass die Informationen aktuell bleiben“, sagt er. “Die Strategiebücher enthalten Checklisten und Entscheidungsbäume, die die Einsatzkräfte durch komplexe Verfahren führen und so die kognitive Überlastung während einer Krise reduzieren.“ (jm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section class="wp-block-bigbite-multi-title"&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Nov. 30 &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26423"&gt;decision to dismiss its lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against SolarWinds and its CISO, Tim Brown, was met with immediate and widespread joy across the cybersecurity leadership community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many CISOs, the dismissal landed not as an abstract legal development, but as something deeply personal. “Thank God,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gadievron/?originalSubdomain=il"&gt;Gadi Evron&lt;/a&gt;, CEO and founder of Knostic and CISO in Residence for AI at the Cloud Security Alliance, said when he learned of the dismissal. “People are feeling relieved, and there is a sense of community and celebrating together,” he tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I breathed a sigh of relief,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianakelleysecuritycurve/"&gt;Diana Kelley&lt;/a&gt;, CISO of Noma Security, tells CSO. After five years of investigation, litigation, and public scrutiny, “I think a lot of CISOs [let out a collective exhale] around this case,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That collective sense of relief, however, should not be mistaken for closure. Experts emphasize that the case did not erase the personal and professional risks of being a CISO, nor did it resolve the deeper structural tension it exposed. Security leaders are still held publicly accountable for cyber failures while lacking full authority over budgets, disclosures, and enterprise risk decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/657599/sec-sues-solarwinds-and-its-ciso-for-fraudulent-cybersecurity-disclosures.html"&gt;the SolarWinds case&lt;/a&gt; sparked a deeper recognition that cybersecurity responsibility should be a shared responsibility across enterprises, shifting policy priorities and future administrations could once again put CISOs in the SEC’s crosshairs, they warn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the legal saga of Tim Brown — along with &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-chief-security-officer-uber-convicted-federal-charges-covering-data-breach#:~:text=The%20circumstances%20regarding%20Sullivan's%20violations,Uber's%20response%20to%20the%20FTC."&gt;the federal conviction&lt;/a&gt; of former Uber CISO Joe Sullivan in 2022 — highlights critical steps CISOs can take to protect themselves and their organizations before any similar litigation arises in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="overview-of-the-case-from-russian-hackers-to-dismissal"&gt;Overview of the case: From Russian hackers to dismissal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand why the SolarWinds case sent such a chill through the CISO community, and why its dismissal matters, a &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570537/the-solarwinds-hack-timeline-who-knew-what-and-when.html"&gt;recap of how the breach unfolded&lt;/a&gt; and how the SEC framed its claims is useful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2019 and continuing through November 2020, threat actors — widely believed to be the threat group known as APT20 or Cozy Bear, part of Russia’s foreign intelligence service or SVR — &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570191/solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-explained-why-organizations-were-not-prepared.html"&gt;compromised the Orion IT management solution&lt;/a&gt; sold by SolarWinds by inserting malicious code into a legitimate software update.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using malware called SUNBURST, the &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/570191/solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-explained-why-organizations-were-not-prepared.html"&gt;attackers installed a backdoor&lt;/a&gt; that affected roughly 18,000 customers, although a much smaller subset was selectively exploited, including multiple US government agencies and major companies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years after the technical compromise itself, the fallout took a more personal turn. Amid a streak of other publicly alarming, high-profile breaches in the US, on Oct. 30, 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-227"&gt;filed a civil action against SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt; and — to the shock of many — its CISO, Brown, alleging fraud and internal control failures relating to allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit claimed that SolarWinds and Brown &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2810058/federal-judge-greenlights-securities-fraud-charges-against-solarwinds-and-its-ciso.html"&gt;defrauded investors by overstating SolarWinds’ cybersecurity practices&lt;/a&gt; and understating or failing to disclose known risks. On July 18, 2024, federal judge Paul Engelmayer &lt;a href="https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2024-07/SolarWinds%20Opinion%20%28Dkt.%20125%29.pdf"&gt;dismissed most of the lawsuit’s claims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He basically dismissed all the charges in terms of post-incident activity and said it is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback, but you’re going to have to prove that they really did something intentionally misleading,” &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Sullivan_(cybersecurity)"&gt;Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, who is also a former federal prosecutor and is now CEO of Joe Sullivan Security, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The remaining claims focused on Brown and the degree to which cybersecurity statements posted on SolarWinds’ website before the incident were appropriate in terms of advising customers of their risks. “The judge really focused on that one publication on the company’s website that went into some specificity about what the company does from a cybersecurity perspective and got frankly fairly granular as far as these things go,” &lt;a href="https://www.alston.com/en/professionals/p/peterman-cara-m"&gt;Cara Peterman&lt;/a&gt;, partner with Alston &amp;amp; Bird’s Securities Litigation Group, tells CSO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The judge’s reasoning reassured many security leaders, but it also exposed a more profound discomfort about how accountability is assigned inside modern organizations. “The area that a lot of us were really uncomfortable about was the idea that an operational head of security could be personally responsible for what the company says about its cybersecurity investments,” Sullivan says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He adds, “Tim didn’t have the CISO title before the incident. And so there was just a lot there that made security people very concerned. Why is this operational person on the hook for representations?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even if he had had the CISO role before the incident, the argument still holds, according to Sullivan. “Historically, the person who had that title wasn’t a quote-unquote ‘chief’ in the sense that they’re not in the little room of people who run the company,” Sullivan says. “They don’t report to the CEO; they don’t get a huge budget.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in recognition of this fact, and after settlement talks among the SEC, SolarWinds, and Brown, the securities regulator dropped its suit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, company CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said, “We said from the beginning — and demonstrated during the litigation — the claims were unfounded, and we are happy the SEC has finally decided to abandon them. We stood firmly with our CISO, Tim Brown, and this decision affirms our belief that our team acted with integrity throughout.” SolarWinds has kept Brown on as CISO and paid for his legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="responsibility-without-authority-is-the-real-risk"&gt;Responsibility without authority is the real risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the SolarWinds lawsuit was a familiar problem for security leaders: &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4016334/has-ciso-become-the-least-desirable-role-in-business.html"&gt;responsibility without authority&lt;/a&gt;. The dynamic that caught Tim Brown in the SEC’s jaws is that, despite his experience, seniority, and title, he, like most CISOs, carries tremendous responsibility without any real organizational authority to back him up — with concerns around personal liability in the face of that &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3631759/personal-liability-sours-70-of-cisos-on-their-role.html"&gt;further souring many CISOs on the role&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of the responsibility and very little of the authority,” Knostic’s Evron says. “The organization manages the risk. Our job is to present the risk and to manage the risk once the organization decides what risk to take.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We work in a larger ecosystem,” Noma Security’s Kelley adds. “We are not all-powerful. We cannot make all decisions in a company. We must work within the budget. We can advocate for a budget, but then the budget is decided collaboratively by the business. The same with our resources for headcount, or decisions on what is allowed or what’s not allowed in terms of new controls or new policies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, since the lawsuits against Sullivan and Brown first emerged, CEOs and other high-ranking decision-makers have increasingly come under more pressure to accept some of the cyber incident legal liabilities that have often been the sole province of CISOs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/573871/guilty-verdict-in-the-uber-breach-case-makes-personal-liability-real-for-cisos.html"&gt;In my case&lt;/a&gt;, at my sentencing hearing, the judge turned to the prosecutor and repeatedly asked, ‘Why isn’t the CEO charged?’” Sullivan says. “The judge literally said, ‘As far as I’m concerned, the CEO is at least as culpable, if not more, as anyone else inside the company when it comes to the situation.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sullivan adds, “In Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/4062724/qantas-cutting-ceo-pay-signals-new-era-of-cyber-accountability.html"&gt;in the Qantas case&lt;/a&gt;, the board took away the bonuses for the CEO and a bunch of others. In one of those DOJ civil cyber fraud cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/blogs/fca-qui-notes/posts/2025/08/private-equity-firm-involved-in-cyber-fca-settlement"&gt;Aero Turbine&lt;/a&gt; case, they pierced the corporate veil and went after the private equity firm as well. There is a growing recognition inside government enforcement authorities that if you want to change corporate behavior, you’ve got to aim a little higher than the CISO.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-cisos-should-protect-themselves"&gt;How CISOs should protect themselves&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the SolarWinds case clarified anything, it’s that relief is temporary and preparation is essential. CISOs have a window of opportunity to &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2505459/how-cisos-can-protect-their-personal-liability.html"&gt;shore up their organizational and personal defenses&lt;/a&gt; in the event the political pendulum swings and makes CISOs litigation targets again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I feel that the SEC staff over the past five to ten years has become more educated and has a more in-depth understanding and knowledge as to how this all works,” Alston &amp;amp; Bird’s Peterman says. “CISOs should be breathing a sigh of relief with this development, but I would be cautious about reading into it too broadly based on shifting changes within this administration or the next one,” Peterman adds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Brown had to live through five years of this, first, investigation and, then, litigation,” she says. “And I assume that comes with a significant personal toll, psychological toll, and physical toll. [Brown suffered a heart attack during the litigation.] If CISOs don’t have the necessary indemnification agreements or &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2512968/if-youre-a-ciso-without-do-insurance-you-may-need-to-fight-for-it.html"&gt;directors and officers [D&amp;amp;O] insurance protections&lt;/a&gt; via the bylaws or by agreement, it can also mean that even if you win, it carries a significant financial toll.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Noma Security’s Kelley emphasizes that CISOs will still be the face of cybersecurity for most organizations, which means &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3988361/4-ways-to-safeguard-ciso-communications-from-legal-liabilities.html"&gt;continued diligence in how risks are communicated&lt;/a&gt;. “When customers or regulators or investors need answers, none of that has changed [as a result of the SolarWinds dismissal]. One of the takeaways is being very intentional and accurate in how we communicate about our programs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sullivan advises CISOs and other security leaders to become proactive and communicate throughout the organization what they need. “It’s really important that we not sit in the corner and just let all the risks sit on our shoulders,” he says. “We have to engage with the rest of the executives and the CEO and say, ‘Look, cybersecurity is a company decision.’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also stresses that the CISO community owes a debt of gratitude to Brown for his fortitude. “A lot of us are really grateful for Tim for how he didn’t disappear during this process,” Sullivan says. “He spent a lot of time out at &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DHb1gzF5o4"&gt;different events&lt;/a&gt;, typically closed-door ones, meeting with a lot of people. I had the opportunity to be on panels and calls with him where he and I shared a stage. All of us are very happy that Tim made it through this in one piece, and that he’s standing and that he still has his job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
